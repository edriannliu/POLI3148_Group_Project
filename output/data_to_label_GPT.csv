13039,If there is any better evidence that Israel is lying about the hospital airstrike it's this the first reports of the explosion occurred at around 720 PM local time. Every video the IDF or the Israeli government is sharing around show a blast that occured between 759 and 800.,

16205,First I would like to say that we really want to sell you Typhoons and other weapon systems and that it in no ways creates a conflict of interest when asking you to do things...,
16206,Never in the field of human conflict was so much Owed by so Many to so Few,
16207,Just wondering when theyre going to do a walk out for the Americanhostages more importantly what about the Americandead who had nothing to do with this conflict,
16208,This is far too glib of a description. Both sides of every conflict beleive they have a grievance they are resolving. How they go about trying to resolve it is the real issue.,
16209,Unfortunately I do not believe mitigating the impact of the War in Gaza through micromangement is realistic.Giving the IDF authority to use unrestricted heavy firepower and drag net arrests will minimize foreign response by bringing the conflict to the quickest...,
16210,This shit doesnt help anyones cause. You just look like a callus asshole. Innocent Israelis being held hostage is also not a good thing. The hostages are just as much pawns in this conflict as the Palestinian people. This shit has no winners,
16211,I think she is very much in the minority. Most Democrats and Republicans wholeheartedly support Israel. We also supportthe innocent people in GAZA who are caught up in this conflict.,
16212,the FED will blink because it has give way to global conflict spending. Biden announcing a funding pkg for Israel prematurely was the tell.,
16213,At this point idgaf and its not a conflict. Its a massacre.,
16214,They brokered peace in 1993. Israel did not abide by the peace agreement and kept building settlements. Today the West Bank is completely colonized by Israeli settlers. What party is the responsible for the conflict?,
16215,Political photoop. His presence carries no impact on the resolution of the conflict.,
16216,The same terrorist organization bombing hospitals and deliberately killing innocent civilians who have nothing to do with the conflict. No wait thats Israel my bad.,
16217,Wow you really just learned about this conflict in the past week huh?,
16218,There is no right and wrong side in this conflict anymore. It is simply just conflict. And not new conflict at that. Ages old conflict. The answer is not to fan the flames.,
16219,Okay so U.S has funded Israel in total since WW 2 158 billion dollars  so you can assume they are on Israel side in the Israel and Palestine conflict,
16220,Start paying your debts to society instead of borrowing more from it to hand over to other countries. U.S. tax dollars are not a World War charity fund for every country that has a conflict. It's for U.S. tax funded Public Services provided by the Constitution to U.S. tax payers.,
16221,I don't care who was at fault with this AG Stotts conflict but what I do care about is how there are so many that somehow turn it into a race thing yet again ...,
16222,One of the more upsetting things Ive seen in this conflict is the willingness from both sides to twist facts in order to further dehumanize the other side. Killing helpless civilians is evil enough there is no need to fabricate things.,
16223,If by capitol hill you mean the whiney babies that took over the capitol they are an incredibly loud minority. The polling data on which side Americans are on in this conflict is not with you,

16225,Turkey firmly stands for peace in the IsraelHamas conflict calling for an immediate ceasefire to protect innocent lives and working towards a just and lasting solution.TurkeyForPeace,
16226,I'm surprised that more authors haven't come out in support of Palestine seeing as the Palestinians are pretty much the epitome of dystopian rebel protagonists. The Israel Palestine conflict is basically just The Capitol Vs The Districts in THG right down to bombing hospitals.,
16227,Literally any military ever has killed civilians.Including Hamas WHO STARTED THIS CURRENT CONFLICT. This idea that Israel is somehow unique in its disregard for human life is hysterically absurd.,
16228,He has said that he changed his mind about open borders when he visited the border and spoke to peopleadversely affected by the policy. I fully expect him to keep an open mind about IP conflict and what he should do to advance peace and prosperity for ALL negatively affected.,
16229,Are you fd? Thats why history is important. What you are considering a crime as a border conflict killing can be considered the same for the Hamas attacking because it was all over Palestine before Israel. So its a border conflict killing as well right?,
16230,Netanyahus plan is to use furtherdeaths of Israeli soldiers  Gazan soldiers and civilians to bed in the conflict and secure his own tenure in office. He already faces ICC prosecution for his settlement policies and the GreatMarchOfReturn sniper fire on stone throwers,
16231,Hows America involved other than naval ships in proximity? You all would be crying like a bitch ifBrandon wasnt paying attention to the conflict.,
16232,Stop creating conflict in their countries and they won't come to yours,
16233,The irrational savage monsters purportedly have offered to return the nonIsraeli hostages as they were not the intended targets and not part of the conflict.,

16237,We need to speak out on this atrocity. My heart goes out to all the innocent civilians in this conflict. I am angry that the world is watching the Israeli gov commit genocide. Im also disgusted in our shit show of a government for supporting a war criminal freepalestine,
16238,Yes and this Israeli conflict is the work of Putin working with Iran.,
16239,And that those lives are not used as an excuse to promote hatred and retaliation outside this horrific conflict. Which appears to be happening...,
16240,We Yemenis decided to enter the war against the enemies of the free Arab world namely Israel and we said that if America intervened we would enter into the conflict but America did not listen but rather sent weapons and assistance to kill innocent people so we entered.,
16241,Clans and Militias in Palestinian Politics by Prof. Dror Zeevi is a good imo overview that covers an underlooked portion of militia structures in a lot of Middle Eastern conflict regions. Extended family politics. Should be available in pdf online from the looks of it.,
16242,The real emotional turmoil often comes from an unexpected place our inner circle. We brace for conflict with enemies but the harshest blows often come from friends or familythose we've supported those who have sat at our table and those we've helped in tough times. This,
16243,Lakota ManAptu wat Israelis and Palestinians have both failed horribly. We should grieve for all innocent lives lost in this conflict but should feel anger and disgust at both peoples.,
16244,There is only one answer I can see to resolve conflict in IsraelPalestine. Its in Ephesians 21118.,
16245,better not conflict with dev day stg,

16249,Blatantly lying to spread propaganda helped raise more money and inflame the conflict wow lol,
16250,I don't think so.They have to put up a front for the conservative factors within their countries Iran is the exception.Iran gov't though benefits from a stronger base when there is conflict in Israel.,
16251,Politicians . Always running to the scene  Wtf doesneed to do in a Middle East conflict?! This guy cant even manage California and he needs to interject in big boy issues,
16252,Let me remind you for the past 75 years isreal has been occupying Palestine. This conflict dates back to the great patriotic war aka ww2 in the fucking 1940s this isn't Hamas starting anything it's isreal continuing its actions but this time it's public,
16253,Why is this conflict animating you so much mate? Got any skin in the game? You speak like a Palestinian spokesperson!,
16254,My impression is that for some the reaction to the Israel and Palestinian conflict was always baked in the cake and no details of what has occurred or will occur will change anyones position. IsraelAttack GazaUnderAttack,
16255,Does that mean Kirkpatrick is in conflict of interest?,
16256,Except Israel literally started the conflict. Israel is stealing land and homes from Palestinians and displacing them.,
16257,In times of war you should watch your friends more than your enemy. What we need to is to avoid this conflict in our lands. It was near today it reached the Gulf of Aden and Red sea.,
16258,I am questioning the notion that every postcolonial nation feels the same way about Israel. But I also dont view the IsraeliPalestinian conflict as colonial in nature except for the involvement of Britain which was the actual colonial power that sort of caused it all!,
16259,How do you justify the murder of women  celebrate BABIES being decapitated. In this conflictit will be the innocents on both sides that will suffer,
16260,Providing weapons only escalates the conflict the biggest beneficiaries are American military companies. This is also the reason why America always finds excuses to cause conflicts in many countries,
16261,Israel had 6000 families to move out of the conflict zone and within a matter of hours ALL of those people had housing arranged with friendsfamily  strangers in other Israeli cities. And yet NONE of the other Muslim countries want to take in Gazans. Not a one. I wonder why.,
16262,Im referring to the present conflict as the Omni War as it is a war in the realm of both the physical kinetic space as well as on the psychological and information fronts. It has elements of a civil war world war race war and insurgency all rolled into one.,
16263,Then why aren't the 6 million Palestinians rising up right now? If this is a war on Palestinians why are the 6 million not supporting the Palestinians in Gaza? It's not Islamophobic to ask this question. I genuinely feel for the innocent on both sides of this conflict,
16264,This thread is worth reading! Never read a thread that is forgiving and understanding as this about the PalestineIsraeli conflict,
16265,Whoever truly started this most recent conflict  and a falseflag situation has been suggested by some. As you say we must never forget the innocent casualties of war. Thank you Bernie for being a voice for the people of Palestine.,
16266,The breadth of the frustration and despair of people of goodwill across the globe is so well captured in this photo. Its time to reject the extremist policies  actions on both sides of this longstanding conflict.,
