13791,So Israel bombed a Palestinian hospital murdering 500 people and is trying to blame it on Hamas.,17,956
13792,Israel should demand that an independent group of experts be allowed to go to the hospital site to examine the evidence. It should be able to show definitively where the rocket came from. If Hamas refuses that will tell us something.,17,713
