Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze the polarization on Twitter between pro-Israel and pro-Palestine supporters. 

Dataset Description:
- You will receive a dataset containing tweets related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
- The dataset covers the period from October 7th to October 21st, 2023.

Task:
Your task is to label the tweets in the dataset with sentiment scores.

Sentiment Labelling Guidelines:

General guidelines:
- The sentiment label should reflect the stance/sentiment of the author rather than face value.
- Keywords can sometimes be misleading as the author of a tweet may quote someone they disagree with, or use rhetorical devices such as sarcasm to convey their stance and message to their audience.

1. Label “1” for Pro-Israel Tweets:
   - Tweets that express appreciation, praise, or support for Israel, the Israeli government, Benjamin Netanyahu, or the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
   - Examples include phrases like "I love Israel", "Israel has the right to defend itself", or any negative comments about Palestine, Hamas, or Palestinians.
   - Look for Israeli naming conventions, e.g., "Palestinian terrorists", "Judea and Samaria", "IDF army".

2. Label “0” for Neutral Tweets:
   - Tweets that present a balanced view, factual information, or are unrelated to the conflict.
   - Examples include neutral statements like “Both Hamas and Israel have committed war crimes”, “All lives matter, Israeli or Palestinian”, or factual updates like casualty numbers or unrelated news about Israel.

3. Label “-1” for Pro-Palestine/Hamas Tweets:
   - Tweets that show support or sympathy for Gaza, Palestine, Hamas, or Palestinians.
   - Examples include phrases like "Free Palestine", "It is called Palestine, not Israel", or any negative comments about Israel, the Israeli government, Benjamin Netanyahu, or the Israeli Army.

Output Requirements:
Output "1", "0", or "-1" to each tweet as per the guidelines. Do not explain.>
