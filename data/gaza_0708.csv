facebook,"Kelompok militan Hamas melancarkan serangan dadakan ke Israel, Sabtu (7/10) dini hari. Serangan itu jadi yang terbesar dalam beberapa tahun ini. Dilansir Al Jazeera, jubir Hamas mengatakan operasi militer dilakukan sebagai respons atas kekejaman yang telah dialami Palestina selama berpuluh-puluh tahun. â€œKami ingin komunitas internasional menghentikan kekerasan di Gaza, terhadap rakyat Palestina dan tempat suci kami seperti Al-Aqsa. Ini adalah alasan dimulainya pertempuran ini,â€?tambahnya. Militan bersenjata Hamas tampak memasuki kota-kota Israel, dengan laporan sejumlah baku tembak di selatan Israel. Serangan juga diiringi rentetan roket Hamas dari Jalur Gaza. Setidaknya 40 warga Israel tewas dan 500 lebih lainnya luka, kata layanan ambulans Israel. Otoritas kesehatan di Palestina melaporkan setidaknya 198 warga Gaza tewas, dengan 1.610 lainnya terluka. Militer Israel menyebut telah meluncurkan serangan udara ke Gaza, dengan laporan suara ledakan di sana. Media Israel Reshet 13 TV News juga melaporkan, sejumlah orang di kota Ofakim disandera militan Hamas. Dalam video pengumumannya, Komandan Militer Hamas Mohammad Deif menyerukan warga Palestina di mana pun untuk bertempur. Perdana Menteri Israel Benjamin Netanyahu pun bersikukuh untuk melawan dan 'menangi perang'. Sementara itu, warga Palestina di Gaza mulai bersiap dengan mengungsi dan menyetok sembako. Pertempuran terbesar Israel dan Hamas terakhir terjadi selama 10 hari pada 2021. Presiden Palestina Mahmoud Abbas membela serangan Hamas ini. â€œRakyat Palestina punya hak untuk membela diri dari teror yang dilakukan oleh pemukim dan pasukan pendudukan (Israel-red),â€?ujar Abbas dikutip kantor berita WAFA. Amerika Serikat, Jerman, Prancis, Inggris, Belanda, Ukraina, dan sejumlah pejabat Uni Eropa mengutuk keras serangan yang disebut 'aksi teroris', sementara Turki dan Rusia meminta Hamas dan Israel untuk menahan diri. Arab Saudi, melalui Kementerian Luar Negerinya, menyerukan kekerasan antara Israel dan Palestina untuk segera berhenti, sambil terus mengikuti perkembangan ini.",,,,,,

facebook,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv: ""Dear citizens of Israel, This morning, on Shabbat and a holiday, Hamas invaded Israeli territory and murdered innocent citizens including children and the elderly. Hamas has started a brutal and evil war. We will be victorious in this war despite an unbearable price. This is a very difficult day for all of us. Hamas wants to murder us all. This is an enemy that murders children and mothers in their homes, in their beds, an enemy that abducts the elderly, children and young women, that slaughters and massacres our citizens, including children, who simply went out to enjoy the holiday. What happened today is unprecedented in Israel â€?and I will see to it that it does not happen again. The entire government is behind this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities. We will destroy them and we will forcefully avenge this dark day that they have forced on the State of Israel and its citizens. As Bialik wrote: 'Revenge for the blood of a little child has yet been devised by Satan'. All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble. I say to the residents of Gaza: Leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere. At this hour, the IDF is clearing the terrorists out of the last communities. They are going community by community, house by house, and are restoring our control. I embrace and send heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families whose loved ones were murdered today in cold blood and endless brutality. We are all praying for the well-being of the wounded and all those who are being held hostage. I say to Hamas: You are responsible for their well-being. Israel will settle accounts with anyone who harms one hair on their heads. I appeal to the residents of the south: We all stand alongside you. We are all proud of your heroism and your fighting. To our beloved IDF soldiers, police officers and security forces personnel, remember that you are the continuation of the heroes of the Jewish people, of Joshua, Judah Maccabee and the heroes of 1948 and of all of Israel's wars. You are now fighting for the home and future of us all. We are all with you. We all love you. We all salute you. To the medical and rescue teams, and the many volunteers who came out in force today in a long list of places, the people of Israel salute you. With your spirit, we will overcome our enemies. Today, I spoke with US President Biden and with other world leaders in order to ensure freedom of action for Israel in the continuation of the campaign. I thank President Biden for his strong and clear words. I thank the President of France, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and many other leaders for their unreserved support for Israel. I now appeal to all citizens of Israel. We stand together in this campaign. This war will take time. It will be difficult. Challenging days are ahead of us. However, I can promise one thing: With the help of G-d, the forces that we all have in common and our faith in the Eternal One of Israel, we will win."" Video: GPO",,,,,,

facebook,"Israeli jets launched massive strikes on targets in Gaza, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is â€œat warâ€?after Hamas attacked Israel by air, sea and land on Saturday. The militant group told Al Jazeera its military operation was in response to decades of Israeli atrocities against Palestinians. Deaths on each side numbered in the hundreds. Hamas said it was holding dozens of Israeli troops and civilians hostage.

The Hamas attack began with a salvo of more than 2,000 rockets fired into Israel. Scores of Hamas fighters broke through border fences to enter Israel and attack towns.

The Israeli military put the country on war alert and began striking targets in Gaza in response, setting the stage for what was likely to be a new heavy round of fighting between the bitter enemies. In a serious escalation, salvos of rockets fired from Gaza set off constant air raid sirens as far north as Jerusalem.

Videos posted on social media showed what appeared to be uniformed Palestinian gunmen inside the Israeli border town of Sderot.

A video from Gaza showed what looked like the lifeless body of an Israeli soldier being trampled by an angry crowd of Palestinians shouting â€œGod is Great.â€?Other footage appeared to show Palestinian militants dragging away an Israeli soldier, still alive, on a motorcycle and Palestinian men dancing atop an Israeli tank that had been set ablaze. The authenticity of the videos could not immediately be verified.

The elusive leader of Hamasâ€?military wing, Mohammed Deif, announced the beginning of what he called â€œOperation Al-Aqsa Storm.â€?

By early evening, the Israeli military said fighting continued in at least five places in southern Israel, around 70 Israelis had been reported dead by emergency medical groups, and Israel had retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities. At least 198 Palestinians were killed in either gun battles or airstrikes, the Gazan Health Ministry said.

The Hamas militants behind the attack also took Israelis hostage, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said. 

In an assault without recent precedent in its complexity and scale, the militants crossed into Israel by land, sea and air, according to the Israeli military, leading to some of the first pitched battles between large groups of Israeli and Arab forces on Israeli soil in decades. As of early evening there were the two main battles taking place, near the towns of Ofakim and Beeri, Admiral Hagai said.

All told, the Israeli military said that the militants had entered at least 22 Israeli towns, abducting soldiers and civilians, including an older grandmother. Residents of Israeli border towns told broadcasters that gunmen were moving door to door, looking for civilians. Unverified footage appeared to show Palestinian fighters transporting captured Israeli civilians and bodies through the strip.

â€œWe are at war and we will win it,â€?Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a televised statement, announcing a call-up of Israeli military reservists.

Qatar, which has been starkly opposed to normalisation with Israel, expressed ""deep concern"" over the developments in the Gaza Strip.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Israel was ""solely responsible for the ongoing escalation due to its continuous violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, including its recent repeated intrusions into the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque under the protection of the Israeli police"".

instagram,"You may have noticed distorted headlines about Palestinian resistance fighters today. A reminder that what took place today is in direct response to more than 75 years of ethnic cleansing, subjugation, and oppression meted out by Israeli colonizers. 

For the people of Gaza, who have endured over 15 years of Israeli siege, bombing campaigns, and collective punishment, resistance is their way of seeking a dignified life. Today, they broke free, if only for a moment, to show the world that freedom for Gaza and all of Palestine is an undeniable truth on the horizon. 

There will be no peace, calm, or normalcy from the river to the sea without ending Israeli colonial violence. Palestinians cannot be expected to be complicit in the face of increasing brutality, impunity, and lack of accountability. No more lives need to be lost. Ending the occupation of Palestine will end the root of the cycle of violence.

They donâ€™t want to compromise. They donâ€™t want a dialogue. They donâ€™t want to see the existence of the Jewish state. So, when we evacuated, when we withdrew from Gaza 17, 18 years ago, they took power. And since then, they use[d], exploit[ed] every square inch in the Gaza Strip.

â€œThese Hamas attacks are a disgrace, and Israel has every right to defend itself with overwhelming force,â€?Trump said, according to the Times of Israel and an emailed statement from the former president.

â€œSadly, American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks, which many reports are saying came from the Biden Administration,â€?he added, as the Times said he was apparently blaming the U.S. governmentâ€™s policy on Iran for the assault. â€œWe brought so much peace to the Middle East through the Abraham Accords, only to see Biden whittle it away at a far more rapid pace than anyone thought possible. Here we go again,â€?Trump concluded.

The Associated Press (AP) reported Saturday morning that, according to Israelâ€™s national rescue service, numerous individuals were killed during the terrorist assault, noting that hundreds were wounded and many are listed in critical condition:

The militant Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip have carried out an unprecedented, multi-front attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets as dozens of Hamas fighters infiltrated the heavily fortified border in several locations and catching the country off-guard on a major holiday. Israel says at least 40 people have died.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Israel was â€œat warâ€?and called for a mass mobilization of army reserves. The invasion revived memories of the 1973 war practically 50 years to the day.

Cinquenta anos apÃ³s a Guerra do Yom Kippur, na qual a inteligÃªncia de Israel enfrentou crÃ­ticas por nÃ£o prever adequadamente o ataque dos paÃ­ses vizinhos, o paÃ­s se encontra em uma situaÃ§Ã£o semelhante.

Neste sÃ¡bado de manhÃ£, dezenas de militantes palestinos conseguiram entrar em Israel a partir de Gaza e ocuparam cidades, mantendo israelenses como refÃ©ns. Simultaneamente, mais de 2.200 foguetes foram disparados a partir do territÃ³rio controlado pelo Hamas.

""Isto nunca aconteceu na histÃ³ria de Israel. Vilas israelenses estÃ£o sob o controle de facto de militantes do Hamas, que estÃ£o colocando fogo em casas e matando famÃ­lias. Todo o ataque comeÃ§ou de surpresa, ninguÃ©m previu que iria acontecer"", afirmou Nimrod Goren, especialista do Instituto do Oriente MÃ©dio. ""Tudo isso Ã© inÃ©dito em termos de magnitude e vai contra toda a percepÃ§Ã£o anterior sobre a situaÃ§Ã£o em Gaza. As pessoas acreditavam que a situaÃ§Ã£o estava sob controle.""

A operaÃ§Ã£o do Hamas a partir de Gaza surpreendeu Israel. Em situaÃ§Ãµes anteriores de ataques com foguetes, havia pelo menos algumas indicaÃ§Ãµes de que algo estava prestes a acontecer. No entanto, desta vez, tanto o governo quanto o pÃºblico nÃ£o tinham qualquer indicaÃ§Ã£o prÃ©via, o que causou um choque ainda maior na populaÃ§Ã£o.

""Um evento desta escala com penetraÃ§Ã£o pela fronteira e para alÃ©m da fronteira, isso Ã© inÃ©dito. Ã‰ a primeira vez que isso acontece "", disse Kobi Michael, pesquisador sÃªnior do Instituto para Estudos de SeguranÃ§a Nacional. ""Mas vai alÃ©m disso. Toda a operaÃ§Ã£o estava claramente bem preparada e planejada, o que realÃ§a uma grande falha da inteligÃªncia de Israel em relaÃ§Ã£o Ã s questÃµes operacionais.""

Kobi observa que esta foi a primeira vez em que o primeiro-ministro Benjamin Netanyahu declarou oficialmente guerra contra o Hamas, e representa a primeira vez que Israel declara guerra desde 1973. Por outro lado, Nimrod aponta que Ã© importante aguardar a confirmaÃ§Ã£o oficial do ExÃ©rcito.",,,,,,

Moments later, the dancing stops as the airborne arrivals are revealed as motorised paragliders carrying armed Hamas militants. As rocket fire also begins, the dancers flee for their lives â€?chased by gunmen bent on shooting or kidnapping anyone in their path.

Following the rampage, which began at around 7am on Saturday, dozens of partygoers were reported to have been killed or kidnapped, with many more still missing. The unconscious body of a dreadlocked female attendee was later paraded through Gaza in a truck, as passers-by spat on her. Among those reported to have been captured was a 26-year-old British citizen, Jake Marlowe, who was helping with security at the rave.

People search through the remains of a mosque in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.

Israeli jets battered Gaza on Sunday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed ""mighty vengeance"" for the bloodiest attack in decades by Hamas.

In a sign the conflict could spread beyond Gaza, Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah exchanged artillery and rocket fire.

In Alexandria, two Israeli tourists were shot dead along with their Egyptian guide.

Israeli air strikes also pounded housing blocks, tunnels and homes of Hamas officials in Gaza.

Many hundreds of people have been killed on both sides.

This resident was at evening prayers and says the mosque was struck without warning.

On Saturday, Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns, killing hundreds of people.

In southern Israel, gunmen were still fighting Israeli security forces in several places 24 hours later.

More rockets were fired from Gaza.

A spokesperson from the armed wing said they abducted a number of Israelis, quote, ""several times greater"" than dozens.

This amateur video geolocated to the Gaza strip shows an injured woman with her arms tied being bundled into the back seat of a 4x4.

Reuters couldn't confirm when it was filmed.

So many abductions add another layer of complication for Netanyahu - in previous episodes hostages were exchanged for many prisoners.

Israel was caught completely off guard by Hamas's assault, in what some see as one of the worst intelligence failures in its history.

Israel's military released this video showing what it said was the targeting of Palestinians along the border fence.

It said it had regained control of most infiltration points, killed hundreds of attackers and taken dozens more prisoner.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a speech the assault would spread from Gaza to the West Bank and Jerusalem.

#Israel #Gaza #Hamas
Israeli festival goers could be seen dancing in the desert at dawn on Saturday, completely unaware that within minutes members of the Hamas militant group were about to descend from the skies and inflict terror.

The revelers had gathered for an all-night trance music rave near Kibbutz Re'im, close to the Gaza Strip, to celebrate the end of the Sukkot religious holiday.

youtube,"An explosion rocked the Gaza strip on Saturday (October 7), sending smoke and dust across the city, after the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas launched a surprise assault that combined gunmen crossing into Israel with a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza.

The Israeli military said it had responded with air strikes into Gaza, after Hamas launched a raid into Israel on Saturday.

Reuters video captured the moment a building was struck in Gaza city, spewing plumes of thick black smoke into the air.

The building which collapsed after air strike, called ""Palestine Tower"", is the headquarters of several offices of media institutions in the city.

Israel said the Iran-backed group had declared war as its army confirmed fighting with militants in several Israeli towns and military bases near Gaza, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate.

At least 100 Israelis are reported dead, with hundreds more wounded in the attack.

The Israeli military confirmed Israelis were being held captive in Gaza and soldiers have been killed, according to N12 and Reshet 13 news outlets.

La presencia de HamÃ¡s serÃ­a algo que, segÃºn algunos analistas israelÃ­es, estÃ¡ promoviendo el primer ministro Netanyahu, que tiene interÃ©s en que HamÃ¡s estÃ© en el poder porque eso paraliza cualquier intenciÃ³n de progreso en unas hipotÃ©ticas negociaciones

Se mantienen en un tira y afloja desde hace dÃ©cadas. Entonces, Â¿por quÃ© ocurre esto ahora? HamÃ¡s alega que se debe a la presiÃ³n de Israel sobre la mezquita de Al Aqsa en JerusalÃ©n. Otros tambiÃ©n apuntan al enfado de HamÃ¡s por el este acercamiento entre Israel y Arabia SaudÃ­. Pero para muchos analistas, va mÃ¡s allÃ¡.

La gran interrogante es cÃ³mo esta operaciÃ³n pudo pillar desprevenido al Mossad, el servicio de inteligencia israelÃ­, considerado uno de los mÃ¡s sofisticados. La situaciÃ³n pone en alerta a toda la regiÃ³n. Especialmente a LÃ­bano, desde donde Hezbollah ha lanzado ataques. TambiÃ©n, al archienemigo de Israel, IrÃ¡n. HamÃ¡s ha confirmado hoy que ha contado con el apoyo de TeherÃ¡n para llevar a cabo la operaciÃ³n.

El ministro de EnergÃ­a israelÃ­, Ysrael Katz, ha firmado una orden para desconectar la Franja de Gaza de la red elÃ©ctrica israelÃ­, en represalia por el ataque.

youtube,"A video showing an Israeli family being held hostage by armed members of the Hamas group surfaced on Sunday. The footage, shared widely on social media, shows a family struggling to free themselves from the Hamas terrorists after they seemingly execute one of the young girls in the family.
In the video, a couple, along with their minor son and daughter, is seen sitting on the floor in distress. The son can be heard asking his father about the blood on his hands, to which his sister responds with, ""I wanted her to stay alive. My sister is dead,"" referencing the execution of her sibling.

El conflicto tambiÃ©n se ha desplazado hacia la frontera entre Israel y el LÃ­bano, despuÃ©s de que las tropas israelÃ­es respondieran a un lanzamiento de proyectiles - reivindicado por el grupo HizbolÃ¡ - desde ese territorio.

AsÃ­ lo ha confirmado el portavoz del EjÃ©rcito israelÃ­, Richar Hecht, que seÃ±ala que se han rescatado a los israelÃ­es que eran rehenes de HamÃ¡s en las zonas liberadas, pero no ha facilitado cifras. Se calcula, no obstante, que un centenar de personas, ""soldados, pero tambiÃ©n civiles, incluyendo niÃ±os y abuelos"", permanecen secuestradas por el grupo dentro de Gaza.

AdemÃ¡s de los ataques israelÃ­es sobre Gaza en este clip pueden escuchar las denuncias de los familiares de los desaparecidos y de los tomados como rehenes cerca de la Franja de Gaza por las milicoas palestinas de HamÃ¡s.

Several other buildings were also targeted by the Israeli warplanes across the blockaded strip including residential buildings and public facilities.

Iyad al-Bozom, spokesman of the Gaza-based Interior Ministry, said Israeli warplanes carried out hundreds of airstrikes on different targets across Gaza.

According to Hamas, its surprise attack was in response to the desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque and increased settler violence. It said it fired rockets and captured many Israelis.

In response, the Israeli army initiated a ""large-scale operation to defend Israeli civilians against the combined attack.""

India on 7 October issued advisory for its nationals in Israel and asked them to remain vigilant and observe safety protocols. Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel in years on Saturday, a surprise assault that combined gunmen crossing the border with a heavy barrage of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip during the sacred Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. At least 22 Israelis have been killed in the surprise attack launched by Hamas. 

The advisory also directs Indian nationals to refer to the Israeli Home Front Command website (https://www.oref.org.il/en) for additional information and preparedness resources.

In case of emergencies, Indian citizens are urged to contact the Embassy of India in Israel at +97235226748 or send a message to cons1.telaviv@mea.gov.in. Embassy personnel are available to provide further guidance and assistance.

youtube,"KOMPAS.TV - Hamas menahan sejumlah warga sipil dan tentara Israel dan membawanya ke Gaza setelah melancarkan Operasi Badai Al Aqsa.

Salah satu yang ditangkap adalah Mayjen Nimrod Aloni, salah satu komandan pasukan Israel.

Penangkapan ini disebut sebagai upaya Hamas menukar warga Palestina yang ditahan Israel. 

Belasan anggota kelompok Hamas keluar dari jalur Gaza yang diblokade dan memasuki kota-kota terdekat di Israel.

Serangan itu disebut menewaskan ratusan orang dari pihak Israel dan Palestina.

Serangan udara Israel meratakan sebuah gedung tinggi di pusat Kota Gaza.

Israel membalas serangan kelompok Hamas dengan meledakkan gedung. Gedung itu roboh beberapa saat setelah terkena bom. 

Israel melancarkan sejumlah serangan udara setelah Hamas meluncurkan ribuan roket melintasi perbatasan. 

Pertempuran terjadi di 22 lokasi selama 12 jam, dimana ratusan orang tewas dari kedua pihak.

Rocket attack makes direct hit on apartment in Ashkelon in southern Israel, police say

The Hamas rocket attack on Sunday targeting Ashkelon made a ""direct hit,"" according to Israeli Police.

Police said the rocket fire hit an apartment building.

Ashkelon is not far north of the border with the Gaza Strip.
A building in Ashkelon was directly hit by a rocket early Monday after a barrage of rockets were fired on the city from the Gaza Strip.

Israel at War | At Least 700 Israelis Killed, 2,000 Wounded; Over 130 Civilians and Soldiers Held Hostage in Gaza

Hamas, which earlier said it was targeting Ben Gurion International Airport, also said it had launched ""a major missile attack with 100 rockets"" on Ashkelon in southern Israel.

The rockets were fired at the coastal city in response to Israel Defense Forces ""targeting of their safe houses,"" said the Izzedine al Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian militant group.

Ashkelon is not far north of the border with the Gaza Strip.

Another barrage of rockets were fired towards the city minutes later.

youtube,"Adam Boehler Suggests Iran's Influence in Israel-Gaza Conflict

  Adam Boehler, a prominent figure in U.S. foreign policy, has suggested that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza would not have occurred without Iran's involvement. Boehler, known for his insights into international relations, pointed to Iran's role in fueling tensions in the region.

  Boehler's comments come as the Israel-Gaza conflict continues to escalate, with both sides exchanging airstrikes and rocket attacks. He emphasized that Iran's support for militant groups, such as Hamas, plays a significant part in perpetuating the violence.

  According to Boehler, Iran's influence in the conflict is evident in its provision of financial aid, weapons, and training to these groups. He believes that without Iran's backing, the intensity of the conflict would likely diminish.
  While the primary focus of the Israel-Gaza conflict lies in the longstanding territorial disputes and political grievances between the two sides, Boehler's remarks provide valuable insights into the broader geopolitical context. They also underscore the need for diplomatic efforts to mitigate Iran's involvement and promote a peaceful resolution.

  As the violence persists, international attention remains fixed on the Israel-Gaza conflict. Boehler's observations serve as a reminder that addressing the underlying factors, including external influences, is crucial for long-term stability and peace in the region.

  The ongoing conflict highlights the intricate web of geopolitical interests and power dynamics that shape the Middle East. Efforts to de-escalate tensions and foster dialogue between all parties involved will be key to finding a lasting resolution to the crisis.",,,,,,

youtube,"Israel Engages in War as Massive Explosions Rock Gaza in Hamas Offensive

 In a heightened escalation of tensions, Israel finds itself at war as massive explosions rock the Gaza Strip following a series of attacks by Hamas. The ongoing conflict has raised concerns over the worsening situation in the region and the potential for further violence.

 The hostilities were triggered when Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched a barrage of rockets towards Israeli cities. In response, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) swiftly retaliated by launching airstrikes on multiple targets within Gaza. These airstrikes resulted in large-scale explosions and significant destruction across the territory.

 The violence has already claimed numerous lives on both sides, with reports of casualties and injuries continuing to rise. Civilians, including women and children, are unfortunately caught in the crossfire, further amplifying the humanitarian crisis.

 The international community has expressed deep concern over the situation and has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the conflict and prevent further loss of life. However, achieving a peaceful resolution remains a daunting task in such a volatile and deeply entrenched conflict.

 The current conflict between Israel and Hamas has once again highlighted the long-standing tensions and the urgent need for a comprehensive and lasting solution. The situation is rapidly evolving, and the world watches with apprehension as the violence continues to escalate.

On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale offensive against Israel from the Gaza Strip. The attack was the deadliest against Israel in decades, and resulted in the deaths of over 600 Israelis and 300 Palestinians.

It is also important to note that there are different perspectives on the conflict between Hamas and Israel. Some people believe that Hamas is a terrorist organization that is targeting innocent Israeli civilians. Others believe that Hamas is a legitimate resistance movement that is fighting for Palestinian independence.

The war between Hamas and Israel is a long-standing conflict that has been ongoing for decades. The two sides have fought four major wars since 2008, and there have been numerous smaller clashes and skirmishes.

The current round of violence began in April 2021, when tensions between Israelis and Palestinians escalated over the eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem. Hamas responded by firing rockets at Israel, which led to Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.

The fighting continued for 11 days, and resulted in the deaths of over 250 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. The war ended with a ceasefire agreement, but tensions between the two sides remain high.

The use of the Rajum missile system by Hamas is a significant development in the conflict. The missile system allows Hamas to strike targets in Israel with greater accuracy and lethality than its previous rockets. This could lead to more casualties and destruction in future conflicts.

It is important to note that there are different perspectives on the conflict between Hamas and Israel. Some people believe that Hamas is a terrorist organization that is targeting innocent Israeli civilians. Others believe that Hamas is a legitimate resistance movement that is fighting for Palestinian independence.

The conflict is complex and there is no easy solution. It is important to understand the different perspectives on the conflict in order to work towards a peaceful resolution.",,,,,,
