facebook,"Live: Latest developments in Palestinian-Israeli conflict on day eight Israel said its infantry and tanks had carried out ""localized raids"" inside the Gaza Strip on Friday, its first announcement of a shift from an air campaign to ground operations. Israel ordered residents of the populous Gaza City to evacuate southward within 24 hours. The surprising attack by the armed group Hamas on October 7 has led to fierce fights between Israel and the Gaza-ruling faction. Over 3,000 people have been killed on both sides amid the escalating conflict.

facebook,"When it comes to that point where you don't know what decision to make amongst options to marry. When you can't seem to find any peace in your soul to go on with the person you have chosen to marry. Shut down everything. Hold up that proposal. Delay that wedding. Emotionally disconnect from that person for about three days. And spend some good time with the Holy Spirit. Do not talk too much in the place of prayer, its not about long hours of tongues, it's more about long hours of meditative listening. Just listen. Meditate on the Word and just listen. Learn the art of emotionally disconnecting to hear from the Lord. Your problem is that you want to talk mushy on the phone with that person for 3hours, then pray 5minutes and expect 21 Angels to appear in your dream with an answer from God. You want to go on dates and spend the weekend together, then read one verse of the Bible and expect to ascend into the inner courts of God for an encounter that will reveal the name of your spouse. Our emotions will always be in conflict with our discernment. Our emotions will remain the greatest resistance to an encounter with God in whatever form. Disconnect, go away with God for a while, so that you can hear clearly. And, if you know you are not going to trust the Voice of the Lord in whatever reply you get on prayer, then you might as well just go ahead and have the wedding today. Send me the address to the reception, I'll love to attend.

facebook,"That was a good result for Australia, and it is not unchristian to say so. To explain why, here is the short opinion piece I had published in The Australian in September 2022... My views have not changed. STARTS. In February 1957 the National Council of Churches in the US distributed a blistering attack against racial segregation in a pamphlet written by Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr for the 35th annual observance of Race Relations Sunday. “All men, created alike in the image of God, are inseparably bound together,” King wrote. As the apostle Paul reminded us in his declaration on Mars Hill, it was “God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth”. He “made from one man all the nations that they should inhabit the earth”. King was building the theological foundation for the great civil rights campaigns of the 1960s, for the fight against a society and a system of laws that divided a nation against itself along racial lines. Dividing a country by race, he argued, was “a tragic evil that is utterly un-Christian”. Yet a nation divided by race is exactly the desired outcome of those seeking to enshrine an Indigenous voice to parliament in the Australian Constitution. We are told by proponents of the voice that democratic institutions are not good enough for Indigenous Australians but they need their own, Indigenous-only, race-based body within the structures of government. Not only do they claim this will correct the injustices of the past, they also claim this is the only way to guarantee Indigenous Australians can have a say over the laws and policies that affect them. If this were true, it would mean our democratic institutions are so broken they are unable to incorporate the ambitions and aspirations of Indigenous Australians. Apart from anything else, this is a blatant denial of the reality that there are currently 11 Indigenous parliamentarians and an Indigenous Australians minister overseeing a multibillion-dollar government department. But the idea of the voice is presupposed on the false notion that Australians are so divided by skin colour – black v white – that an institution of general function, like a democratic government, cannot act in the best interests of both. Why? Because according to the world view that underpins the voice, white Australians are so irredeemably trapped by the privilege afforded to them by the colour of their skin and the racist structure of our colonising democracy that we couldn’t hear Indigenous Australians even if we wanted to. That is exactly what is preached to us by the advocates of identity politics and critical race theory. They say that conflict and oppression between races is inevitable and, worse, that we cannot escape these destructive forces because we are marked by our skin colour and the structure of our society. We cannot presume to speak for each other and we cannot presume to act in each other’s best interests. A white politician can never fairly represent a person of colour, nor can a person of colour be fairly treated by a white-majority institution such as parliament. Of course, this is a lie. Anyone can tell the truth and anyone can act in the best interests of anyone else – because we are all humans first. These false ideas lead to the inevitability that the voice will become the woke voice. It won’t be the Indigenous voice, it will be the critical race theory voice, the identity politics voice. The result of the voice will be a Constitution claiming that I, as a white man, am inescapably an oppressor to people of colour. It is a permanent statement that our nation is irredeemably segregated by a barrier to our shared humanity that cannot be scaled – our race. Under this postmodern world view, racism is a human condition. It’s not about individual acts of racial prejudice, it’s about the racist structure – the systemic racism – that is baked into us and all that we do. Clearly, none of this is true and the reality is very different. Anyone can reach out a hand to help anyone. It comes down to something Christianity reveals to us because we believe that one God made one man from whom all races are descended. There is one race, ultimately: the human race. Our democracy as expressed in our Constitution rightly presupposes the equality of every Australian. As the apostle Paul reminds us, the kingdom of God is colourblind, for “there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus”. Our temporal, earthly “kingdoms” do well to model the greatest kingdom of all. Our Constitution should remain colourblind. And Australians would be wise to be wary of the voice and the sinister ideas behind it. For, as King reminded us, a nation segregated by race is a blatant denial of the unity that we are all offered in Christ.

facebook,"""In dealing with conflict, we should first contemplate that our adversary wants to be happy and be free from suffering, just as we do. Next, try to see things from their point of view. By looking at the situation from their perspective, we’ll be able to see clearly who has the mistaken idea, and who is in error. We will be able to see our own faults clearly, too. If, through this contemplation, we find that we are the ones in error, then we can begin to address those faults in ourselves. Should we confirm that yes, the other person is the one who is confused and at fault, we’ll still be able to see the situation with compassion. We’ll recognize that they are trying for happiness, but they misunderstand how to attain it. They might be harming us, and others too, yet we can understand that their behavior is actually impeding the happiness that they’re trying to achieve."" -Mingyur Rinpoche Read more through joy.tergar.org #mingyurrinpoche #tergar #joyofliving #conflict #compassion #conflictmanagement #empathy #meditationteacher",,2775,"{'like_count': 1901, 'comment_count': 101, 'num_users': 236366}",Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche,,2023-10-14 12:24:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/145019708_248255526663740_25075850543390159_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=t4Qtqw5BrCUAX9bt4xg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDtPnKyRiTvRBp038LEAiJdqeDz5tSt-Qs37ejtB7meCA&oe=657D16DD,https://www.facebook.com/100044378828217/posts/853804352775518,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392928087_853804326108854_3249688770616979455_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nhlxIyBwON8AX8KDDFh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDzISfWYFTr72TgccNQCJTYoYlq4CZ0BPe4u8VGwi98Qw&oe=6559CD34

facebook,"This short documentary is five years old and gives a great insight into the issue of Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. To understand the conflict it is necessary to understand the manner in which these settlers have prevented a two state solution from eventuating. It's also important to note, and I recall from my own time in Israel, that many moderate and secular Israelis despise these settlers and their dogmatic beliefs. It has been consecutive right wing Governments that have refused to reel them in or prevent their growth. I think it is also important to reflect on the Jewish yearning for statehood as a historically persecuted people. It certainly doesn't forgive their treatment of Palestinians but the context of their story over the past 2000 years has to be considered.",,2566,"{'like_count': 1204, 'comment_count': 460, 'num_users': 46540}",Carrick Ryan,,2023-10-14 04:58:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/290016231_588252616048356_52366744061228178_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bbldZ3w7478AX9y1hTN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD2a6rSjYKlHvWMDEWd7lAmBU-OWWcuP7i8onI83NYWaA&oe=655B6ADB,https://www.facebook.com/100045908673621/posts/879298806943734,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/392729150_2335801056628701_5737094636600501763_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=97kCnUgHZkkAX87Xd0r&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCdiOAQB4m7jDungYtyBEysn-kRBZnEtNb3QqBZ9srO0w&oe=6555D90A

facebook,"10 lessons from the book Surrounded by Idiots: The Four Types of Human Behavior (And How to Effectively Deal with Each One) by Thomas Erikson: 1. There are four types of human behavior. Erikson identifies four types of human behavior: Reds, Yellows, Greens, and Blues. Reds are direct and assertive, Yellows are optimistic and social, Greens are analytical and cautious, and Blues are empathetic and caring. 2. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. Reds are good at getting things done, but they can be abrasive and insensitive. Yellows are good at building relationships, but they can be flaky and unreliable. Greens are good at solving problems, but they can be indecisive and perfectionistic. Blues are good at understanding people, but they can be overemotional and avoidant. 3. It's important to understand your own type and the types of the people around you. This will help you to communicate more effectively and to build stronger relationships. 4. You can't change people's types, but you can learn to deal with them more effectively. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each type, you can learn to adapt your communication style and to avoid unnecessary conflict. 5. Reds need to be direct and to the point. If you're dealing with a Red, be clear about what you want and don't beat around the bush. 6. Yellows need to be appreciated and encouraged. If you're dealing with a Yellow, be sure to praise their work and to let them know how much you value their contributions. 7. Greens need to be given time to think things through. If you're dealing with a Green, don't rush them into making a decision. Give them time to weigh all of the options carefully. 8. Blues need to feel understood and supported. If you're dealing with a Blue, be a good listener and offer them your support. 9. It's okay to say no. If you're feeling overwhelmed or uncomfortable with a request, it's okay to say no. Don't feel guilty about setting boundaries. 10. Don't take everything personally. It's important to remember that people's behavior is often a reflection of their own issues, not of you. Try not to take things personally and to focus on the positive aspects of your relationships. Erikson's book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to improve their communication skills and to build stronger relationships. It is a book that can help you to understand yourself and the people around you better. Surrounded by Idiots is a popular book, but it has also been criticized for being simplistic and for promoting stereotypes. It is important to keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with people. The best way to build strong relationships is to be genuine and to treat each person as an individual.

facebook,"On 14 October 1066 the armies of William, the Duke of Normandy, and the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson clashed near Hastings, in one of the most famous battles in history and one that would decide the fate of the English throne. Unusually for battles of the time, the clash at Hastings lasted all day. The conflict was only ended by groups of Anglo-Saxon warriors breaking discipline and charging from out of their shield wall. They were then surrounded, cut off, before being cut down by Norman warriors. Late in the day, the Anglo-Saxon King Harold was hit in the eye with an arrow. It was a fatal blow. With their king dead, the retreating Anglo-Saxons were defeated. The Normans were victorious.

facebook,"A few thoughts… Firstly, Du’a is a matter between Allah and His slave. While making du’a publicly may be encouraging others, don’t lose sight of the fact that your du’a is not the same as your post of a du’a. I’m reminding myself and all of you to do sincere worship of Allah and make du’a to Him for our Palestinian family in the hours that count most. Secondly, in the immediate sense let’s try and support whatever reliable charities and relief efforts are able to get through to our family in plight. Here are some that I and my colleagues recommend: https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/5206538/trustees https://islamic-relief.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI26jlsqH1gQMVB6fVCh0YuALIEAAYASAAEgIHhvD_BwE:=:https://islamic-relief.org/ Thirdly, let’s spread the truth and the actual history of this conflict as is now being exposed to be filled with war crimes even from non-Muslim and bipartisan sources. Ideologues are incapable of honest conversation but a huge majority of humanity simply doesn’t know. Don’t assume bias on behalf of non Muslims and simply make people aware of resources that are highlighting this situation both current and past from an academically honest and journalistically sound perspective. Many of you are more educated in this matter than I am. I encourage you to post the interviews, documentaries, articles and reports that meet this criteria in the comment section. Fourth, I am aware, deeply pained and almost paralyzed by the fact that it feels like it’s all we can do. Of course in addition, us becoming more informed consumers and customers, urging our local politicians and raising our voices on social media platforms is not to be underestimated. But there is a feeling of helplessness that overshadows it all. I have an overwhelming set of thoughts about all of this and the word of Allah swt. I’ll gather them, organize them, and soon present them in a video by Allahs will.

facebook,#BREAKING UPDATE: I have CONFIRMED that there was no request for a DNA swab or otherwise from Mohbad’s corpse after his death while his body is still in custody of Pathologists and investigators. A fake tweet sponsored by mischief makers online had several twitter influencers posting but Nobody could even post that DNA 🧬 result because it did not exist. Mohbad’s dad told BBC that he attempted to kill 👀his son Liam by drowning him in a river days before his death. Nobody knew what was going thru his mind. I also confirmed that his mother-in-law does NOT pose a conflict of interest in the case as a policewoman. Wunmi’s mom is retired 👮🏼 The events unfolding in #Justice4Mohbad is bizarre. Please don’t allow social media sentiments and media trials to brainwash and consume you. I will continue to brief you on pertinent information. @2222MediaSchool on X and here.

Having previously worked in both Palestine and Israel, we never expected to witness organized violence targeting innocent animals. Our partner on the ground, Let The Animals Live (LTAL), based in Ashkelon, Israel, runs a shelter and clinic. Despite the devastating rocket attacks in Ashkelon, they managed to relocate 32 sick and injured dogs and cats to their shelter in Kfar Ruth, Israel. We are determined to ensure the safety of these animals, and here's our plan to make it happen: Our team, Let The Animals Live (LTAL), accompanied by veterinarians, has traveled south with essential supplies, including pet food and equipment, to assist as many animals as possible. Although the most dangerous areas are currently inaccessible, the resources funded by your donations are reaching courageous volunteers in those regions. These volunteers are risking their lives to provide critical, life-saving aid to street animals and abandoned pets in the most desperate situations. Your donations are crucial to support their efforts. Please join us in this mission by sharing this post and making a generous donation today: https://bit.ly/3Fc2tBC.:=:https://networkforanimals.org/donation/ Together, we can save as many of these four-legged survivors as possible.

facebook,"Tatjana Omanovic was taken from us abruptly and prematurely on July 25th, 2023. A mother of four, she was an immigrant who overcame poverty and deprivation to become a US Marine and a budding entrepreneur. Her family are at a loss without her. Tatjana was born in 1974 in Hamburg, Germany and grew up in Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia. When possible, her family summered on the Adriatic, cementing an early love of the ocean and sun. She was an accomplished kayaker who was preparing to represent her country in the 1992 Olympic Games when the brewing Balkans conflict redirected her life forever. At age 15, she emigrated to the US, where she lived with her father in a van in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, until his tile-installation business afforded him the money for a modest home. With only two sets of clothes to her name, Tatjana taught herself English – one of her seven languages – and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1994. She served as a linguist for Special Forces operating in the Balkans, followed by postings in Washington DC, Hawaii, North Carolina, Iraq and San Diego over a 20-year career. She started her family in Virginia in 2002 with the birth of twins Dorian and Adrian, with Sebastian joining them in 2005. Despite lengthy deployments, she and her boys would be emotionally inseparable for the remainder of her life. Tatjana's romance with Owen Dickinson began in 2008, when both were Marines. As he puts it: Theirs was a love for the ages, and he is heartbroken. Tatjana retired from the Corps in 2014 as a gunnery sergeant and settled with Owen and the boys in Carlsbad, California. Aleksandar arrived in 2015. Despite a lengthy list of military accolades, she considered her family her greatest achievement. She was a connector of people who found success outside the military in businesses as varied as brokering mortgages and promoting wellness. Her beauty, generosity and magnetic personality were paired with a heart bigger than her petite frame should have been able to support. Everyone dies. Not everyone truly lives. Tatjana was an example for all of us. In addition to her husband and children, she is survived by her sister, Aleksandra Clark.",,1164,"{'like_count': 291, 'comment_count': 166, 'num_users': 200710}",Honoring Fallen Marines,,2023-10-14 23:00:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242868812_4337239903022169_598642986425471167_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=MLiRWnBIbNIAX-bECxD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBQLSRXZ1YxEQxnPUJ4U5rhy4-wMYw3n_hFBlVkzn0wiQ&oe=655A2C4F,https://www.facebook.com/100064407171285/posts/731062249050674,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391618262_731041289052770_2812320758740652742_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=SNb0J38FkBsAX8c7ECY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCLwx86_DQN5wthbuxyBMuqN2rW-ChGALJg_ZR8F1EZJw&oe=65467B32

facebook,"The fact that nothing happened in America yesterday on the “Global Day of Jihad” which was called for by a Hamas leader, just further shows that this latest iteration of the Israel-Palestinian war is not America’s war. Many were fearing a massive wave of terrorist attacks here, like the ones Hamas carried out in Israel last weekend, but nothing happened. The conflict there has been going on there for 75 years, and it’s not our problem. We have plenty of our own. There are tragedies around the world every day. We can’t abandon our own citizens to go and try to help others at the expense of Americans every time we see viral videos and a news cycle about conflicts on the other side of the globe. Yes it’s sad. There’s a lot of sad things in the world. But America can’t rob Peter to pay Paul. We have to take care of OUR citizens. Our borders. And our country. Remember: Al-Qaeda attacked the United States on 9/11, not because they “hate our freedom” as the Operation Mockingbird assets all sung in concert, but because of our financial and military backing of Israel which angers many Muslims around the world who side with the Palestinians in the ongoing territorial disputes in the region. Years later when Congressman Ron Paul said that the attacks were “blowback for decades of US intervention in the Middle East” he was attacked for “blaming America,” but the intelligence agencies and foreign policy experts all know the truth. Inside job / false flag theories aside, this was still the case. One of the most prominent “conspiracy theories” of what happened is the LIHOP hypothesis, the “let it happen on purpose” theory, which doesn’t negate Al-Quada’s hatred for America or their involvement in planning and carrying out the attacks on 9/11 (even if they were aided and directed by the CIA and other intelligence agencies).

facebook,"OPEN HEAVENS DEVOTIONAL DATE: SUNDAY OCTOBER 15TH 2023 THEME: THE LAND OF ENDLESS SUFFERINGS MEMORISE: And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Matthew 13:42 READ: Matthew 13:24 30, 36-43 24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. MESSAGE Those who don’t end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ‘And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.” All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: “Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.” The passage does not say ‘the worm’ does not die, but ‘their worm’. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire. There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely. REFLECTION Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell because of that sin you keep committing? If not, sop it today. BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: Mark 6-7 AUTHOR: PASTOR E. A ADEBOYE HYMN 20: STAND UP,STAND UP FOR JESUS 1 Stand up! stand up for Jesus, Ye soldiers of the Cross! Lift high His royal banner; It must not suffer loss.

facebook,"Finishing Strong: Going the Distance for Your Family by Steve Farrar is a book about how to maintain a strong family through the challenges of life. Here are eight lessons from the book: 1. Finishing strong is more important than starting strong. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how you finish that matters. If you're committed to your family, you'll keep coming back, even when it's hard. 2. Your family is your most important ministry. Don't neglect your family in the pursuit of other goals. Make time for your spouse and children, and let them know that they are your top priority. 3. Your marriage is the foundation of your family. Invest in your relationship with your spouse. Communicate regularly, resolve conflict in a healthy way, and show each other love and affection. 4. Be a good role model for your children. Children learn by watching the adults in their lives. Model the behaviors and attitudes that you want to see in your children. 5. Don't be afraid to ask for help. No one can do it alone. If you're struggling, reach out to other family members, friends, or professionals for support. 6. Forgive yourself and others. Everyone makes mistakes. When you or someone in your family makes a mistake, forgive them and move on. 7. Focus on the positive. It's easy to get bogged down in the negative aspects of life. But it's important to focus on the good things as well. Make time for fun and laughter, and appreciate the blessings in your life. 8. Never give up. There will be times when you feel like giving up on your family. But don't. Remember that your family is worth fighting for. If you are looking for a book that will help you to be a better husband, father, and family leader, I highly recommend Finishing Strong: Going the Distance for Your Family by Steve Farrar.

facebook,"7 days of darkness in the Holy Land calls for a sacred moment of light from around the world. Please join us in a shared prayer for Israel from the Office of the Chief Rabbi. 🕯️ “Our Father in Heaven, Rock and Redeemer of Israel. We come before You in prayer and supplication, stunned and heartbroken by the merciless atrocities carried out against our beloved State of Israel and its People, turning the Festival of our Rejoicing into a day of our suffering. We mourn the loss of many hundreds of women, men and children brutally murdered in these attacks and pray for their souls. We pray for the speedy recovery of the thousands who are injured. And may the Holy One, blessed be He, have compassion on those who are being held hostage and enable them to emerge from the darkness of the shadow of death to their freedom; may He break their bonds, deliver them from distress, and bring them swiftly home to their families’ embrace. Almighty God, protect the families of Israel from the threat of terror and give strength to the soldiers of the Israel Defence Forces, whose lives are in danger as they confront our enemies. Put into the hearts and minds of Israel’s political and military leaders the wisdom to make the right decisions to bring this conflict to a swift and successful conclusion, so that innocent civilians can resume their lives without the fear and threat of attack. Spread over the inhabitants of Your land the tabernacle of Your peace, as it is written: ‘I will grant peace in the Land; you will lie down and none shall make you afraid. And the sword will not pass through your land.’ May You, Almighty God, bless us all with security and tranquillity and grant a true, just and lasting peace in our Holy Land and across the entire world. ‘May He who makes peace in high places, bring peace for us and for all the people of Israel.’ “ Amen. 🙏",,882,"{'like_count': 272, 'comment_count': 203, 'num_users': 1160018}",Stand for Israel,,2023-10-14 01:36:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271755360_300334002132002_2630218614094183484_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IWSzlsoa484AX-EfVCz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDzxOtQoC29BGxuMOdwXbJ9VdYVv_yaSmIZcLv6aG7wFg&oe=655A5E8A,https://www.facebook.com/100064662135005/posts/713831634115568,

facebook,"MY SUGAR MUMMY CALLED "" I've dated my girlfriend for two months now, and she has been a wonderful girl. Unlike other ladies I've dated, she's so special and homely. Whenever she visited, she'd always do some cleanings for me. She has taught me how to cook some common foods so that I would stop buying every single meal from outside. She visited me two days ago, slept in my house, and yesterday morning, a call woke me up from bed. It was my mummy, but I saved her second number with 'Sugar Mummy'. I didn't pick the call as I knew it was gonna be long and she might perceive I slept with a woman... she's a strong Catholic and wouldn't tolerate such. Immediately she saw that I didn't pick the call, she forcefully took my phone from me and saw it boldly written, 'you had 2 missed calls from Sugar Mummy'. She threw the phone on the bed and picked her stuffs. While I was trying to hold her and explain, she hit the door on me and left. Since then, she hasn't been picking my calls. I know I've once been reckless and so carefree about Relationship, I'm truly serious with her and I want to marry her. This is not the first time a thing like this has happened. It seems she is hot tempered and very jealous. And when she is upset, you dare not come close to her. I'm so confused right now. The truth is that I don't want to lose her"". I engaged him for up to thirty minutes, and in our long conversation, I gave him a little task to do. He actually granted I share this story for instructional purposes that's why you are seeing this. . . The only advice I have for you is to be as open as possible in your Relationship and marriage. If you have things about you that could trigger distrust, conflict or malice, make out time and tell your partner about it... don't let them get that as a surprise. Do you know why? If they find out themselves, you may not be certain how the reaction would be. On the other hand, no matter how upset you're, try and listen. Don't conclude with what you think, because what you think might be totally wrong. Give your partner a listening ear, so as to validate what you're thinking and possibly dialogue. I reposted this to serve as a reminder, feel free to add your own advice if you have. If you want to discuss your relationship with me, send me a direct message through the messenger, I'll attend to you. Remember, when you read a post you learnt from, it's wise to Like and Share. My desire is for you to have the very best Relationship experience before and in marriage. Do have a lovely day. #cyprainnwako Image Credit: Smiling Couple",,774,"{'like_count': 670, 'comment_count': 68, 'num_users': 1855761}",GODLY MARRIAGE AND RELATIONSHIP COUNSELING( GODMARC),,2023-10-14 10:34:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/307080495_5512166185515103_8334161080780928242_n.jpg?stp=c0.8.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ukYLan840nkAX8IuSEe&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA6TvZjOfHzLrsouB9OuhOoh4KUG8TTkWTqXGhpQ1ijvg&oe=655A09DF,https://www.facebook.com/groups/2443977612304623/permalink/6775549745814033,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391530047_6949185241769448_5353726833916118702_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8Zi2_IxXyXcAX9ieetV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCH_ZnVHkAnLpF_eCEaNnvJM8VLt7hPdWEAsYMJRwFGlg&oe=6531DAF1

facebook,"""In dealing with conflict, we should first contemplate that our adversary wants to be happy and be free from suffering, just as we do. 

Next, try to see things from their point of view. By looking at the situation from their perspective, we’ll be able to see clearly who has the mistaken idea, and who is in error. We will be able to see our own faults clearly, too. If, through this contemplation, we find that we are the ones in error, then we can begin to address those faults in ourselves. Should we confirm that yes, the other person is the one who is confused and at fault, we’ll still be able to see the situation with compassion. 

We’ll recognize that they are trying for happiness, but they misunderstand how to attain it. They might be harming us, and others too, yet we can understand that their behavior is actually impeding the happiness that they’re trying to achieve."" -Mingyur Rinpoche

Matthew 13:42 READ: Matthew 13:24 30, 36-43 24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. MESSAGE Those who don’t end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ‘And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.” All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: “Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.” The passage does not say ‘the worm’ does not die, but ‘their worm’. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire. There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely. REFLECTION Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell because of that sin you keep committing? If not, sop it today. BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: Mark 6-7 AUTHOR: PASTOR E.

facebook,"The last weeks amounted to what was essentially a siege. American forces used flamethrowers and napalm to great effect, and heavy artillery and air attacks provided essential support. Eventually, armored bulldozers collapsed cave entrances, entombing Japanese soldiers within the bowels of the earth. Peleliu was finally secured by the end of November 1944, when organized Japanese resistance ceased. Colonel Nakagawa committed suicide after ordering his regimental flag burned. Virtually the entire Japanese garrison of 11,000 was wiped out. The record shows that 202 prisoners were taken in the campaign, and only 19 of these were Japanese. The rest were Korean or Okinawan laborers. The Peleliu campaign was one of the bloodiest of the entire Pacific War, but it had a curious postscript. On April 27, 1947, Lieutenant Tadamichi Yamaguchi led 26 survivors out of hiding and handed over his samurai sword in a token of surrender. Yamaguchi and his men made the last formal capitulation of World War II, a conflict that had ended 20 months before in 1945. #ww2 #army #victory #usmarines #usmc #MilitaryHistory #war #ww2history",,614,"{'like_count': 500, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 190234}",Ghosts of the Battlefield,,2023-10-14 15:00:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/374649505_285165190895552_3633519156668233658_n.jpg?stp=c2.4.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p57x57&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2wJJLihhxPcAX-23qTK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDhFCDWaNUyvZjnfl19p1_myQH3wLI9WxcEwQJh7hLe-g&oe=655AF60E,https://www.facebook.com/100082062190144/posts/305587768853294,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391594035_305556395523098_2716659762312675595_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yVIlrNLSpXwAX9ACm2G&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDo-9BNg7vuTetTrHCZ13L-odZshUOAIZ2syAmfoISuZQ&oe=652FC425

When upon life’s billows
You are tempest tossed,
When you are discouraged,
Thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Refrain:
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one,
Count your blessings,
See what God hath done!
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Are you ever burdened
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will keep singing
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings.
Wealth can never buy
Your reward in Heaven,
Nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict
Whether great or small,
Do not be disheartened,
God is over all;
Count your many blessings,
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you
To your journey’s end.

facebook,"Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize, understand, manage, and effectively use your own emotions and the emotions of others. Developing your emotional intelligence can lead to improved interpersonal relationships, communication, and overall well-being. Here are five elaborated tips to enhance your emotional intelligence: 👋Self-Awareness: 1. Recognize Your Emotions: Pay close attention to your feelings without judgment. Identify and label them accurately. For example, instead of saying you're ""stressed,"" specify if you're feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or frustrated. 2. Monitor Physical Signals: Be mindful of how your body responds to emotions. Stress might manifest as muscle tension, a racing heart, or shallow breathing. Recognizing these physical cues can help you identify your emotional state. 👋Self-Regulation: 1. Practice Impulse Control: Avoid reacting impulsively to strong emotions. Take a moment to think before responding to a situation, allowing yourself time to consider the consequences of your actions or words. 2. Manage Stress: Develop healthy stress management techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, exercise, or engaging in hobbies to prevent emotions from overwhelming you. 👋Empathy: 1. Active Listening: When interacting with others, truly listen to what they're saying, not just the words but also their tone and body language. Try to understand their perspective and feelings. This shows that you care about their emotions. 2. Put Yourself in Their Shoes: Try to imagine how the other person feels in a given situation. This helps you understand their viewpoint, which is crucial for showing empathy. 👋Social Skills: 1. Effective Communication: Work on your verbal and non-verbal communication skills. Express your thoughts and emotions clearly and respectfully. This includes both positive and negative feedback. 2. Conflict Resolution: Develop the ability to resolve conflicts amicably. Acknowledge differing emotions, seek common ground, and find mutually beneficial solutions. 👋Motivation: 1. Set Goals and Stay Committed: Establish clear, achievable goals and stay motivated to achieve them. Emotional intelligence is closely tied to intrinsic motivation and a sense of purpose. 2. Resilience: Emotionally intelligent individuals can bounce back from setbacks. Cultivate resilience by viewing challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as insurmountable obstacles. Enhancing your emotional intelligence takes time and practice. It's a journey of self-discovery and self-improvement. By focusing on self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, social skills, and motivation, you can significantly improve your ability to understand and manage emotions, both in yourself and in your interactions with others, leading to more fulfilling and harmonious relationships.

facebook,"OPEN HEAVENS DEVOTIONAL DATE: SUNDAY OCTOBER 15TH 2023 THEME: THE LAND OF ENDLESS SUFFERINGS MEMORISE: And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Matthew 13:42 READ: Matthew 13:24 30, 36-43 24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. MESSAGE Those who don’t end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ‘And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.” All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: “Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.” The passage does not say ‘the worm’ does not die, but ‘their worm’. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire. There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely. REFLECTION Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell because of that sin you keep committing? If not, sop it today. BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: Mark 6-7 AUTHOR: PASTOR E.

facebook,"The loss of so many Palestinian and Israeli lives is heartbreaking. Though my role as a Virginia State Legislator has limited impact on foreign policy, as a Palestinian-American, I am sharing my perspective during this difficult time. There are families across Virginia who mourn or fear for friends and loved ones impacted—including mine. Please know this, while I am no expert on these matters, I do appreciate how complex the situation is. Here are four points we should consider: 1. The atrocities committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians are reprehensible and should be denounced by all. 2. The mounting civilian casualties in Gaza from indiscriminate bombing by Israel is devastating. Israel’s blanket denial of food, water, and other necessities to Gaza is a serious violation of international law and only harms the innocent civilians – half of whom are children. 3. The targeting of civilians is a war crime, no matter who does it, and I urge the international community to work to protect the innocents on both sides of this conflict. 4. All hatred – including antisemitic, anti-Muslim, anti-Arab – should be called out and rejected. No person, anywhere, should have to live in fear of hate and violence. We cannot ignore each other's humanity, each of us deserve equal rights, freedom from oppression, and a life of dignity. My friends, I pray for the lives lost and the ones fleeing terror. I know that the continuation of violence will never bring peace. I hope we can all agree, the Palestinian and Israeli people deserve to live lives free of fear with equal dignity. As the situation only escalates, we stray further from that dream. I pray for a cease-fire and de-escalation to save lives.",,509,"{'like_count': 158, 'comment_count': 65, 'num_users': 15413}",Sam Rasoul,,2023-10-14 02:37:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242981844_394582468906307_5863244669130196198_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bMdWdsVOGi4AX9flb7C&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCVsMez0UiIj1T6UPoWsO1Ieh-aMJ4ecUnDKiIbd-cjQQ&oe=6559B7D3,https://www.facebook.com/100050636702670/posts/869277218103494,

facebook,"7 days of darkness in the Holy Land calls for a sacred moment of light from around the world. Please join us in a shared prayer for Israel from the Office of the Chief Rabbi. 🕯️ “Our Father in Heaven, Rock and Redeemer of Israel. We come before You in prayer and supplication, stunned and heartbroken by the merciless atrocities carried out against our beloved State of Israel and its People, turning the Festival of our Rejoicing into a day of our suffering. We mourn the loss of many hundreds of women, men and children brutally murdered in these attacks and pray for their souls. We pray for the speedy recovery of the thousands who are injured. And may the Holy One, blessed be He, have compassion on those who are being held hostage and enable them to emerge from the darkness of the shadow of death to their freedom; may He break their bonds, deliver them from distress, and bring them swiftly home to their families’ embrace. Almighty God, protect the families of Israel from the threat of terror and give strength to the soldiers of the Israel Defence Forces, whose lives are in danger as they confront our enemies. Put into the hearts and minds of Israel’s political and military leaders the wisdom to make the right decisions to bring this conflict to a swift and successful conclusion, so that innocent civilians can resume their lives without the fear and threat of attack. Spread over the inhabitants of Your land the tabernacle of Your peace, as it is written: ‘I will grant peace in the Land; you will lie down and none shall make you afraid. And the sword will not pass through your land.’ May You, Almighty God, bless us all with security and tranquillity and grant a true, just and lasting peace in our Holy Land and across the entire world. ‘May He who makes peace in high places, bring peace for us and for all the people of Israel.’ “ Amen. 🙏",,481,"{'like_count': 145, 'comment_count': 101, 'num_users': 490078}",The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews,,2023-10-14 01:30:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/278055599_10162479131949896_2098052323482732081_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=X4M-S-Wvi9oAX-lX6Eo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCKKnz9VkKl8nlNgt_-eG4SyQvKkw6hoMJ_VTuxB35FGw&oe=655B5827,https://www.facebook.com/100064575348648/posts/695734539255718,

Blinken met with King Abdullah of Jordan, who rules over a country with a large Palestinian population and has a vested interest in their status, and also with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank. King Abdullah warned Blinken of “any attempt to forcibly displace the Palestinians from all the Palestinian Territories or to cause their internal displacement, calling for preventing a spillover of the crisis into neighboring countries and the exacerbation of the refugee issue,” Jordan’s government said in a statement. Abdullah also stressed the need to open humanitarian corridors for medical aid and relief into Gaza while protecting civilians and working to end the escalation of the conflict. He appealed for international agencies to be allowed to work unhindered. Blinken discussed with the king the efforts to release all the hostages the Hamas militants seized, as well as efforts to prevent the conflict from widening, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. 📷: AP",,442,"{'like_count': 307, 'comment_count': 69, 'num_users': 13090753}",Voice of America,,2023-10-14 07:00:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352992991_178766095145684_5027481947854717491_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=18ZZdScV7x8AX_v3UtK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA-0oRGDfzOgJKAktJbxD6u7JzyNcJUAbbN0bpHjZ8-Q&oe=655A6AC2,https://www.facebook.com/100064458353336/posts/711622437663028,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391733216_711622257663046_1675216893209642758_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=l3Q6FMlbCX4AX-Rgbnl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCjgEW79dsfHGKo96p44IwCAw-sksFlVu6-Lg8dBZOrSg&oe=652F5DEE

facebook,"The symbolism of Ravana’s 10 heads

Every year, Sanatanis (Hindus) around the world celebrate Deepawali, a festival that commemorates Prince Sri Rama’s return to his home, Ayodhya, after defeating the powerful King Ravana. 

Presented as the victory of good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and spiritual light over darkness, narrations of their conflict often convey Ravana as a one-dimensional figure, whose heinous acts, including the kidnapping of Devi Sita, slate him as irredeemably demonic.

No matter how terrible a person appears, however, Sanatan Dharma teaches that nobody is ever completely evil. Ultimately, everyone originates from the Divine, and so everyone is actually pure in nature. Often caught up in the dualities of life — like hot/cold, ugly/beautiful, and old/young — many have a tendency to forget this nature, as they do all they can to attain what they want and avoid what they don’t want, despite how their actions might affect those around them.

Hence, like all, Ravana was a complex being, who exhibited not only negative qualities, but positive ones throughout his life’s journey. An expert warrior, politician, king, as well as astrologer and doctor of ayurveda, he took great care of his kingdom, for even the poorest of its inhabitants were well off, and never poverty stricken. Also an exceptional poet and scholar, each of the 10 heads he is often depicted with are said to symbolize the six shastras and four vedas, as he was a famed devotee of Shiva, the God of Transformation.

But, like many before him, and many after, he was led astray in his desire for pleasure, succumbing to a medley of life’s vices in his pursuit of so-called happiness. Thus, as his hunger for power expanded, his 10 heads of knowledge became better known as symbols of the 10 qualities that exude those who are attached to such power. 

They are:

Kama (lust)

Krodha (anger)

According to the Bhagavad Gita, success in spiritual life depends on a steady intelligence, which can only exist through control of the senses. When we focus too much on an object of the senses, attachment develops. Prolonged attachment turns into intense longing, or lust, and when the object of our lust is not obtained, anger arises. Becoming blinded by anger, we fall into delusion, causing bewilderment and a loss of intelligence, as we lose sight of our true spiritual identity.

In the case of Ravana, Devi Sita was the object of his senses. Controlled by lust, he took her by force and grew angry when she refused to be with him. Blinded by his anger, he lost all intelligence, believing he could defeat her husband Sri Rama, an avatar of Sri Vishnu, who inevitably killed him.

Good and evil, like everything in the material world, are relative, and have no real meaning in connection to divine figures like Rama and Sita. Therefore, a true characterization of Ravana is not that he was a demon, but that he was a person who failed to control his senses, going down a path that led to forgetfulness of his real spiritual identity.

As such, to avoid going down a similar path, we must all strive to act selflessly by controlling our senses, practicing discipline in pursuit of spiritual advancement, rather than our own selfish desires. By such discipline, we can transcend mundane notions of good and evil, and see every person for what they truly are — magnificent and beautiful expressions of the Divine.

facebook,"THE FULL MEANING OF THE WORD ''WIFE'' Some of people will ask, what is the meaning of wife?, who is a wife?, how do you know a wife material?, and so on, but the answer is not far fetched. It your opinion that makes you define your meaning to wife. In this article, i will define wife in an acronym, which are; W - Wise in communication I - Industrious and Innocent in character F - Forgiving in conflict E - Excellent in counsel and comfort If as a wife, this acronym does not tally with your character, you can never win your spouse. Let analyse the acronym, one by one. 1. W - Wise in communication Many wives have wrecked their homes and marriages due to poor communicating skill. As a wife, you need wisdom to communicate certain issues and ideas to your spouse. A great communicating skill will help you have great access to your husband and home at large. 2. I - Industrious and Innocent in Character Secondly, if you want to win your husband to yourself, you must be Industrious i.e hardworking. You may be hardworking in the circular aspect, but you also need to bring it to family and marriage aspect. Try as much as possible you can to put the house in order and your marriage will be like heaven here on earth. Also, as a wife, you must try as much as possible to be innocent in character. This means that your spouse should not have reason to suspect you, neither should he think that you are always keeping a secret from him. You must be plain in dealing with him. 3. F - Forgiving in Conflict In every relationship, conflict is always part of the journey and it has an antidote which is forgiveness. As a wife, forgiveness means letting go the pains you received when being hurt. It also means surrendering your right to hurt you back if you hurt me. One may be tempted not to forgive considering the gravity of the offense, but if you let it grow into full hatred, you are gradually losing your emotions towards the relationship and if not careful the relationship may be dissolved. 4. E - Excellent in counsel and comfort Lastly, as a wife you must be able to give great counsel to your husband and not evil one just as Jezebel in the Bible. With these, your marriage will have a smooth ride.

My sincere hope is that the defeat of this particular proposal - a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament- is not understood as a rejection of the ongoing process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Whatever your vote, we must avoid the temptations of both triumphalism and defeatism and recognise that the task of ensuring better outcomes for Indigenous people can only be advanced if we come together as Australians in genuine charity and recommit ourselves to closing the gap of disadvantage that Indigenous Australians face.

facebook,"The symbolism of Ravana’s 10 heads

Every year, Sanatanis (Hindus) around the world celebrate Deepawali, a festival that commemorates Prince Sri Rama’s return to his home, Ayodhya, after defeating the powerful King Ravana. 

Presented as the victory of good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and spiritual light over darkness, narrations of their conflict often convey Ravana as a one-dimensional figure, whose heinous acts, including the kidnapping of Devi Sita, slate him as irredeemably demonic.

No matter how terrible a person appears, however, Sanatan Dharma teaches that nobody is ever completely evil. Ultimately, everyone originates from the Divine, and so everyone is actually pure in nature. Often caught up in the dualities of life — like hot/cold, ugly/beautiful, and old/young — many have a tendency to forget this nature, as they do all they can to attain what they want and avoid what they don’t want, despite how their actions might affect those around them.

Hence, like all, Ravana was a complex being, who exhibited not only negative qualities, but positive ones throughout his life’s journey. An expert warrior, politician, king, as well as astrologer and doctor of ayurveda, he took great care of his kingdom, for even the poorest of its inhabitants were well off, and never poverty stricken. Also an exceptional poet and scholar, each of the 10 heads he is often depicted with are said to symbolize the six shastras and four vedas, as he was a famed devotee of Shiva, the God of Transformation.

But, like many before him, and many after, he was led astray in his desire for pleasure, succumbing to a medley of life’s vices in his pursuit of so-called happiness. Thus, as his hunger for power expanded, his 10 heads of knowledge became better known as symbols of the 10 qualities that exude those who are attached to such power. 

They are:

Kama (lust)

Krodha (anger)

Moha (delusion)

Lobha (greed)

Mada (pride)

Maatsarya (envy)

Buddhi (intellect)

Manas (mind)

Chitta (will)

Ahamkara (ego)

According to the Bhagavad Gita, success in spiritual life depends on a steady intelligence, which can only exist through control of the senses. When we focus too much on an object of the senses, attachment develops. Prolonged attachment turns into intense longing, or lust, and when the object of our lust is not obtained, anger arises. Becoming blinded by anger, we fall into delusion, causing bewilderment and a loss of intelligence, as we lose sight of our true spiritual identity.

In the case of Ravana, Devi Sita was the object of his senses. Controlled by lust, he took her by force and grew angry when she refused to be with him. Blinded by his anger, he lost all intelligence, believing he could defeat her husband Sri Rama, an avatar of Sri Vishnu, who inevitably killed him.

Good and evil, like everything in the material world, are relative, and have no real meaning in connection to divine figures like Rama and Sita. Therefore, a true characterization of Ravana is not that he was a demon, but that he was a person who failed to control his senses, going down a path that led to forgetfulness of his real spiritual identity.

As such, to avoid going down a similar path, we must all strive to act selflessly by controlling our senses, practicing discipline in pursuit of spiritual advancement, rather than our own selfish desires. By such discipline, we can transcend mundane notions of good and evil, and see every person for what they truly are — magnificent and beautiful expressions of the Divine.

facebook,"I've written this more as a self-reflection rather than a reminder for others, as most of my time every week is spent teaching Islam. As we watch the news and see the calamities befalling the ummah one after the other, we may wonder... Why spend more time in worship, study and learn Islam when our ummah is suffering? Shouldn't we *do* something 'practical' instead? Allah says in the Qur'an, ""Allah will elevate those of you who have faith, and ˹raise˺ those gifted with knowledge in rank."" (58:11) In a time where the Muslims as a whole suffer from humiliation and condescension, it is faith and knowledge that will help raise our rank and status. Also, despite all the persecution & conflict the Prophet SAW and his Companions faced in both Makkah and Madinah, their worship and study/teaching of the Qur'an did not falter, and still occupied most of their time. So we maintain our worship and our learning in Islam. This does not absolve us of practical action, whether it be debunking lies and propaganda about Islam & Muslims, advocating for the rights of Muslims everywhere, protesting, giving sadaqah and participating in whatever other option we have that is Islamically sanctioned, wise and constructive to help our brothers and sisters over the world. There is no conflict or contradiction between the two. And tawfiq is only from Allah.",,379,"{'like_count': 235, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 26427}",The Usuli,,2023-10-14 17:01:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/309274964_532688955332416_2382037380175637722_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Qy9x1KwnsKgAX-L1ALm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBmoo0c00vcF_WWtxUbioV8LfGGZ75CafkLKSL_xUzzOw&oe=655A0F74,https://www.facebook.com/100057739476439/posts/760678675866775,

facebook,"OPEN HEAVENS DAILY DEVOTIONAL DATE: SUNDAY OCTOBER 15TH 2023 TOPIC: THE LAND OF ENDLESS SUFFERINGS MEMORISE: ""And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."" - (Matthew 13:42) READ: MATTHEW 13:24-30, 36-43 (KJV) 24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 42 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. MESSAGE: Those who don't end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ""And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."" All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: ""Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."" The passage does not say 'the worm' does not die, but 'their worm'. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire. There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely. REFLECTION: Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell becasuse of that sin you keep committing? If not, stop it today. BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: MARK 6-7 AUTHOR PASTOR E A ADEBOYE HYMNAL: 20 - STAND UP! STAND UP FOR JESUS 1. Stand up! stand up for Jesus, Ye soldiers of the Cross! Lift high His royal banner; It must not suffer loss. From vict'ry unto vict'ry His army shall He lead, Till ev'ry foe is vanquished, And Christ is Lord indeed. 2. Stand up! stand up for Jesus, The trumpet call obey; Forth to the mighty conflict, In this His glorious day; Ye that are men now serve Him Against unnumbered foes; Let courage rise with danger, And strength to strength oppose.

facebook,"It never made sense to suggest that Hamas planned such a large scale attacks for such a long time (two years, according to a senior Hamas official) right there in Gaza without the knowledge of the Israeli Intelligence which is one of the most sophisticated in the world. The same Israeli intelligence that has eyes and ears in the whole region, not just in Gaza...the same Agency that managed to unmask the identities of the scientists working on Iran's nuclear program and covertly eliminated them one after the other right inside Tehran? The same Israelis that inspect almost every single thing that enters Gaza with their checkpoints all over the place? No nah! The Egyptians have confirmed getting intel about the attacks before they were carried out. CNN just announced that the U.S got intel about the attacks too. The same CNN has aired videos showing Hamas fighters training for the attacks with one of their training camps just a kilometer away from an Israeli security post. A betting man would bet the Jewish authority got intel about the attacks but deliberately did nothing just so they could have a valid justification to finally up-root Hamas from Gaza once and for all. Anyone who has been following the conflict knows the Israelis have never been comfortable with the fact that their number 1 enemy is in charge of Gaza from where they could always fire multiple rockets into Israeli towns and cities. But it is reasonable to assume that Hamas must have considered all possible responses from the Isrealis including ground invasion of Gaza which will kick-off any moment from now, before launching last Saturday's attacks. So what is their game plan? Were they banking on Iran joining the fray directly, not through their proxy like Hezbollah or they were hoping to use the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza to blackmail Israel into halting their retaliatory actions? I'm really curious as to how Hamas thought a Nation that went to war in 2006 killing 1,300 Lebanese and losing 165 of its own people JUST BECAUSE TWO OF ITS SOLDIERS (not civilians ooo) were abducted by Hezbollah, would respond when you attack its civilian population.",,311,"{'like_count': 133, 'comment_count': 150, 'num_users': 73825}",Charles Ogbu,,2023-10-14 19:09:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/382807251_10161342381389255_2001937742175695914_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tNdaLBfVGngAX8lKScz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCVfH22jIzG3qst1B4L6vDN8ZVLUvWDZjKKzi6j1Y5KKQ&oe=655A531B,https://www.facebook.com/charles.ogbu2/posts/10161385427159255,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391756887_10161385497659255_3303219025434675914_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=D6O1vpbFSogAX-Te42m&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCGhZjM-ze3JsWP3kjU_DrOHyiuLyzscSCPjAv7BK1AIQ&oe=654E5C78

Nu știu ce rating are și, sincer, nici nu mă interesează pentru că părerile turcilor oricum nu prea coincid cu ale mele. dar Șerbet de afine a început să aibă un mesaj social din ce în ce mai puternic și un scenariu din ce în ce mai bine pus la punct, mult mai bun decât cel al Pescărușui care a devenit mult prea obsedat de a face episoade multe și mesajul lui s-a ”diluat” daca putem spune așa. Poate voi face o comparație între ele două diseară. Și, dincolo de scenariu și mesaj, Kivilcim are un monolog fulminant atât la început, în fața conacului, cât și la școală, în fața noului proprietar. Mi-au plăcut mult cuvintele ei:”De ce vă e frică de femei”? Și mi-a mai plăcut la fel de mult faptul că Doga a început să riposteze. Sper să nu cadă în extrema cealaltă și să nu accepte niciun sfat bun doar pentru că e venit de la ”Pinko” :D :D Dar îmi place c-a început să-i mai reteze din lamentări :D Îmi pare rău de Umut pe care Apo îl vrea doar...o păpușă de paie în companie...și presimt un conflict când va afla....că sigur va afla.

facebook,"Gaza hospitals were overwhelmed with casualties Saturday as the conflict between Israel and Hamas entered a second week. Witnesses said Israel struck a building in Khan Younis in southern Gaza that housed about 50 people who had fled there after the IDF ordered more than 1 million people to evacuate the north. A hospital in Gaza City treated casualties from what Hamas called an Israeli attack on a convoy heading south along one of two routes Israel had declared “safe.” Hamas said 70 people were killed. Israel said it was too early to establish who was responsible. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Saturday that 15 medical facilities have been damaged in Gaza, and two hospitals have closed. Meanwhile, many Gazans holding foreign passports gathered at the Rafah crossing into Egypt after word spread that they would be allowed to leave. Reports said the evacuation was put on hold until an agreement could be reached to allow aid into Gaza through the crossing. #GazaHamasConflict #IsraelGazaCrisis #KhanYounis",,291,"{'like_count': 108, 'comment_count': 36, 'num_users': 121062286}",CGTN,,2023-10-14 18:30:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/240501168_398442308315914_1975708148483497397_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fqFJPm2ePcQAX_EttAj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmpHfEtK6PszswEM-kc4fo5ZDurnAeUaRWl6uD79W1bw&oe=655A1719,https://www.facebook.com/100044504436603/posts/970453084448164,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/389382667_889475066089473_5683130336906143530_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=QMvgJ014EUcAX-1ljKG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAbpcb5OMjsI6pfBhQyOnjEzzuSq7ROBj9fQYQ_QGWzUA&oe=65319B31

facebook,"British journalist accuses Western media of bias in reporting on Israel-Palestine conflict‼️British journalist, Harry Fear, has accused Western media of exhibiting bias in its coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict, saying the “overarching storytelling” is based on the Israeli narrative, Anadolu Agency reports‼️ Speaking to Anatolia, Fear, known for directing the 2019 documentary, “Gaza: Still Alive”, critiqued the language used by mainstream Western media while reporting on the conflict that flared up last week after a surprise attack by Palestinian group, Hamas, on Israel. Since then, Israel has continued heavy bombardment of Gaza, and has cut its water and electricity supplies, further worsening the living conditions of the Territory that has reeled under a crippling siege since 2007. What we are looking at now is a bloodbath, a bloodbath designed to exact revenge on the Gaza population Fear said. He said the Western media focused on unverified information about Israeli civilians, while neglecting the suffering of Palestinian civilians, especially children who were killed over the years. Singling out the BBC and other reputed media organisations for their choice of words when covering the Gaza conflict, Fear said the British public broadcaster used distinct terminology in its reporting, referring to those killed in Gaza as “died,” and those in Israel as “killed”. Fear also criticised other mainstream outlets for their apparent lack of empathy towards Palestinian civilians. Because Palestinians have basically been categorised effectively as unpeople, humans that are just, well, ‘human animals’, to use the word of the Israeli officials,” he said. “And that’s very much how the mainstream narrative captures the story as well He said “the framing of the conflict in this latest round of fighting usually completely silences the context of 16 years of strangulation and siege, an ongoing war on Gaza, complete denial of Palestinians, human rights, civil rights, political economic rights, really that “dignity as humans at all, largely based on an ideology of racial supremacy and domination.” The British journalist also highlighted the rapid dissemination of false and manipulative news regarding the conflict, saying: “The point is, of course, this is an ongoing war between Israel and Palestinians, and part of that is an informational war. It is a propaganda war.” Commenting on an allegation by an Israeli journalist who claimed live on air that Hamas beheaded 40 Israeli babies, Fear said: “Is it true that Hamas carried out beheadings of 40 children? Well, it looks like that that isn’t true, because there “There has been no evidence.” But, he added, “The story was then fed effectively throughout the English-speaking western media landscape, including landing on the front pages of major London newspapers.” Children “have already been beheaded by Israel’s aerial bombardments, but that is of little to no report in the Western reportage,” he said. https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231013-british-journalist-accuses-western-media-of-bias-in-reporting-on-israel-palestine-conflict/",,281,"{'like_count': 142, 'comment_count': 39, 'num_users': 55247}","Jerusalem ""Al-Quds"" is the Capital of Palestine",,2023-10-14 00:04:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312527672_484986470335695_4514270114700884458_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8UHp-40wnjMAX_Hovot&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmz2zrXECPUkrs4DgvQ_IuMGyvRfV0_xvMpvty9lpBLg&oe=655A118F,https://www.facebook.com/100064730374657/posts/722050786629261,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391707988_722050749962598_6498245057991683584_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GPNlOGUCEGcAX9TUQT6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBtS7PtG5HtN4EbjWXKfjPXssYULtYtTPl1Or7ofUia0g&oe=653588C7

facebook,"As demonstrations condemning the violence in the Middle East continue to grow across the globe, we have connected with and listened to the concerns of our local communities who feel impacted by these international events. We realize violence and large-scale demonstrations happening globally can instill a variety of emotions in Calgarians, leaving some feeling fearful. In an effort to ensure all Calgarians feel safe in our city, today our officers proactively increased patrols near local places of worship and other areas of significance. We also setup our Mobile Command Vehicle downtown to ensure our officers are prepared to initiate a response to potential incidents. At this time, there is no direct threat to the public in Calgary, and, we continue to work with other law enforcement agencies, community leaders and local groups in our city to monitor the situation. It is standard practice for police to monitor all major, planned events and demonstrations, manage public safety, keep the peace and respond to any calls for service accordingly. So far, there have been no incidents reported in Calgary in relation to the conflict in the Middle East. We police behaviour, not beliefs. Hate-motivated crimes of any kind have no place in our community and we will not tolerate behaviour contrary to the law that is associated with hate speech or harassment. We encourage anyone who is planning an event or a demonstration to review the information on our website: calgarypolice.ca/protesting:=:https://www.calgary.ca/cps/community-programs-and-resources/protesting-in-calgary.html.

facebook,"Signs of a Narcissist Narcissism, a personality disorder characterised by a sense of entitlement, lack of empathy, exploitation, and envy, is often accompanied by specific behaviours that can help identify individuals afflicted by this condition. Exhibiting an inability to listen to others' opinions is a prominent sign of a narcissist. Such individuals are so infatuated with themselves that they dismiss any viewpoint contrary to their own as irrelevant or inconsequential. Another common characteristic of narcissists is their incessant need for control. They seek to dominate others in every aspect of life, whether personal or professional, refusing to relinquish control even when it is unwarranted or inappropriate. In relationships, this need leads to the erosion of trust and stifles the growth of those around narcissists. Narcissists also exhibit a tendency to hold grudges, unable to forgive or forget perceived wrongs. Their inability to handle conflict maturely and move on from it hampers healthy relationships and perpetuates a cycle of strife. Furthermore, narcissists consistently evade taking responsibility for their actions, often shirking blame onto others. They have an uncanny ability to absolve themselves of any wrongdoing, leaving their victims feeling frustrated and invalidated. Moreover, a narcissist always views themselves as faultless and consistently blames others for their failures or shortcomings. In their eyes, rules and societal norms do not apply to them, as they believe they are special and deserving of exceptions. This sense of entitlement fosters a disregard for authority and a contemptuous attitude towards regulations. Finally, a narcissist exhibits an insatiable appetite for more; no matter how much they receive, it is never enough. Whether it is attention, admiration, or material possessions, they constantly seek to fill an internal void that cannot be satisfied. Recognising these signs is crucial in dealing with narcissists as it allows us to protect ourselves from their toxic behaviours. By maintaining awareness and establishing healthy boundaries, we can navigate relationships with narcissists and prioritise our own well-being.

facebook,"OPEN HEAVENS DAILY DEVOTIONAL DATE: SUNDAY OCTOBER 15TH 2023 TOPIC: THE LAND OF ENDLESS SUFFERINGS MEMORISE: 'And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."" - MATTHEW 13:42 READ: MATTHEW 13:24-30, 36-43 (KJV) 24 Another parable put He forth unto them, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and His disciples came unto Him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man; 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the Kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the Angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of Man shall send forth His Angels, and they shall gather out of His Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 42 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. MESSAGE: Those who don't end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ""And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."" All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: ""Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."" The passage does not say 'the worm' does not die, but 'their worm'. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says that the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire. There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then will make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you will remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely. REFLECTION: Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell becasuse of that sin that you keep committing? If not, stop it today. BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: MARK 6-7 AUTHOR: PASTOR E A. ADEBOYE HYMNAL: HYMN 20 - STAND UP! STAND UP FOR JESUS 1. Stand up! Stand up for Jesus, Ye soldiers of the Cross! Lift high His royal banner; It must not suffer loss.

facebook,"Good morning to all our followers and to a very delicate subject that I’ve ignored for several days now but now feel I must address. The latest news and hype is the Palestinian attack on Israel that killed three hundred people which will obviously provoke more conflict between both countries. As with any conflict it’s politics and sides will be taken . One post in particular on this page goes back to the September commemorations at Ginkel Heath and has been receiving comments of an inflammatory nature . Now unfortunately I’ve said this once twice and it probably won’t be the last time . The Arnhem Boys is not your private political platform to vent your spleen on. At the risk of becoming repetitive our aim is solely to our Arnhem Veterans and their families and to ensure our past is not forgotten and remains in our future. Reading some of the comments I’m also receiving personal messages to the effect that some political views aren’t the sort of thing that’s expected on a veterans page . Having said that I as admin am duty bound to intervene. We are purely a Veterans Page and as the page is growing so rapidly I obviously don’t want to lose anyone’s support . But again WE ARE NOT A POLITICAL PLATFORM FOR THE TROUBLES OF THE WORLD ……especially when feelings run high for both countries involved. So regrettably I have to put my Policeman’s hat on again and say this, any posts in future that are NOT of an Operation Market Garden subject and refer to modern political controversy ie Israel/Palestine will most certainly be removed . Whilst I’m the biggest advocate for democracy…………, there is a time and a place for everything and it’s not going to be on this page . My first duty as admin is to uphold the love and respect of the lads that took part in Operation Market Garden seventy nine years ago . If you have been involved in the 102nd birthday adoration of our Ron Johnson . You’ll notice that the numbers are now in their high thousands and I’m left reeling at the comments. But knowing Ron he’s also an adorable character. I will not allow anything to distract from our devotion of our veterans . If you wish to become involved in modern day politics and conflict please seek out pages dedicated to it ……….NOT The Arnhem Boys because I will as soon as they land delete them . Thank you for your time & patience.

The comments and sheer adoration for Veteran Ron Johnson’s 102nd birthday wishes has broken all records of such wishes for our veterans …..as one of your admins for this page it’s left me reeling with the amount of kindness you’ve all shared for Ron . They say that first impressions are lasting and from day one of meeting Ron Darren said to me the way his men looked up to him had to be seen . I’ve found and included to this post a short piece of video film of Ron speaking at the internment of the late Des Page’s ashes near the Whitehouse where both Des and Ron fought side by side. You’ll hear Ron speak about his former Sargent as Darren lays Des beside his former colleague the late Iain Bonner. These snippets of film are as important as the battles they fought in . Because they show the true and lasting camaraderie that is only ever found of fighting men. To my Darren who knew Des and Iain and very much knows our Ron . He said these moments in time he’ll never forget and is so proud and fortunate to have been part of their lives as The Arnhem Boys. Next year sees the 80th Anniversary of Operation Market Garden. It is our hope to make an appearance next year to celebrate the lives of all who served , fought and died during the conflict . We’ll honour as always those veterans that are still with us . We’ll also honour those that payed the highest price for victory. But until then join with us and enjoy a little more from birthday boy Ron Johnson .

facebook,"Justice Inyang Okoro to head Supreme Court panel on presidential election Petition. Justice John Inyang Okoro has been nominated to coordinate the Supreme Court panel that will oversee the presidential election petition filed by the candidates of Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Gregory Obi, and the People Democratic Party PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, respectively. News Band gathered that Justice Okoro is currently coordinating other Justices of the Supreme Court out of the total of eleven Justices currently serving in the apex court. An insider, however, revealed to this medium that there is heavy arm-twisting among the Justices as the majority are insisting on following the electoral act and the federal constitution governing elections in the country devoid of technicalities. In the meantime, it was learnt that the Chief Judge of the Federation, Chief Justice Olukayode Ariwoola and Justice Kekere-Ekun have both recused themselves to avoid conflict of interest. Justice Ariwoola, this medium was informed, recused himself over his longstanding relationship with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who is one of the Respondents in the petitions. On her part, Justice Kekere-Ekun recused herself over her relationship with Alhaji Abubakar through her husband who is a serving board member of American University of Nigeria, Yola, owned by the PDP flag bearer. Justice Okoro, it was gathered, is faced with an uphill task of securing a unanimous judgement from the seven justices required by Law to be on the panel. Another source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, meanwhile revealed that the “arm-twisting” involves the Department of State Security (DSS) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Yusuf Fagbemi. Fagbemi, the source said, is the middle man between the camp of the presidency and the Supreme Court led by Justice Inyang Okoro. It is left to be seen whether the Justices of the Supreme Court will uphold the electoral act and the constitution or whether they will rely on technicalities like the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC). According to information gleaned from the apex court website, currently, there are eleven Justices. With the recusal of both Chief Justices Ariwoola and Kekere-Ekun due to conflicts of interest, only nine remain from which seven will be selected. According to the source, the three Justices are under heavy pressure to either unflinchingly adhere to the constitution without compromise, which will be a blow to the camp of Tinubu, or play along as the judges of PEPC were accused of.",,262,"{'like_count': 99, 'comment_count': 131, 'num_users': 116769}",A WIN FOR PETER OBI IN COURT.,,2023-10-14 21:50:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/400165731_318085854369020_7942875132042303519_n.jpg?stp=c0.3.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=l1x-H-PAPKUAX8xUlSK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDnaIK9TEqewoBuDTPQmWWZKLI06IBPuIS4WhFAtcN2_Q&oe=6559BCA6,https://www.facebook.com/groups/684828816317821/permalink/870863984380969,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387872927_304774489033490_5416847513486081696_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=1A6AVuA5ML8AX8EyCT7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCXR6AODClxz7VnLFdCM9fIF9efGpGs4apsxs9dMy6loA&oe=6530E08B

facebook,"OPEN HEAVENS DAILY DEVOTIONAL DATE: SUNDAY OCTOBER 15TH 2023 TOPIC: THE LAND OF ENDLESS SUFFERINGS MEMORISE: ""And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."" - (Matthew 13:42) READ: MATTHEW 13:24-30, 36-43 (KJV) 24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 42 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. MESSAGE: Those who don't end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ""And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."" All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: ""Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."" The passage does not say 'the worm' does not die, but 'their worm'. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire. There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely. REFLECTION: Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell becasuse of that sin you keep committing? If not, stop it today. BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: MARK 6-7 AUTHOR PASTOR E A ADEBOYE HYMNAL: 20 - STAND UP! STAND UP FOR JESUS 1. Stand up! stand up for Jesus, Ye soldiers of the Cross! Lift high His royal banner; It must not suffer loss. From vict'ry unto vict'ry His army shall He lead, Till ev'ry foe is vanquished, And Christ is Lord indeed. 2. Stand up! stand up for Jesus, The trumpet call obey; Forth to the mighty conflict, In this His glorious day; Ye that are men now serve Him Against unnumbered foes; Let courage rise with danger, And strength to strength oppose.

facebook,"🔵⚪️ɢᴏʟᴅᴇɴ ᴏᴘᴘᴏʀᴛᴜɴɪᴛʏ ɢᴏᴇꜱ ʙᴇɢɢɪɴɢ ғᴏʀ ꜱᴛʀᴀʏ ғᴏxx🔵⚪️ Via SMH Sport 📰 By Danny Weidler ✍️ In a horrible case of bad timing mixed with terrible behaviour, Josh Addo-Carr has embarrassed Bulldogs club bosses again and wasted the time of the boss of the game, Peter V’landys. Addo-Carr was meant to have a high-level meeting with ARL Commission chairman V’landys just days before he was involved in a brawl at the Koori Knockout on the Central Coast. A meeting was called by Bulldogs general manager Phil Gould to help Addo-Carr plan a career after football. Addo-Carr was a late withdrawal from the meeting because of his selection in the Australian Prime Minister’s XIII to play Papua New Guinea on September 30 – which he also withdrew from. Addo-Carr’s agent, Mario Tartak, and the star winger’s partner represented him. Gould initiated the idea of Addo-Carr becoming the face of Indigenous rugby league in the closing years of his time at Bulldogs and then into retirement. That shows the level of regard that Gould has for Addo-Carr and flies in the face of suggestions that the pair have had ongoing issues. If Gould has now lost faith in Addo-Carr it would be understandable. Bulldogs officials and all of those who have gone out of their way to support him have been let down in recent times by his actions. Addo-Carr lost his cool at the Koori Knockout, and even his closest supporters say he has got what he deserved in terms of his two-match ban, $5000 fine and exclusion from the Kangaroos for the Pacific Championships. His teammates on the day and those who saw the event say there was no real excuse for his actions. Addo-Carr then posted on social media on Wednesday about the conflict between Israel and Palestine, and then had to apologise for that as well. It was embarrassing for the Bulldogs and another problem they didn’t need to deal with. V’landys won’t comment about Addo-Carr’s off-field indiscretions but confirmed the meeting. “I was happy to have the meeting because not enough is done to help players transition into retirement,” he said. “It’s a major issue, and when Phil Gould asked for the meeting I was only too happy to meet with them and try and plan something for Josh and his family. I’m open to meeting with players who have ideas about what they’d like to do and I’ll assist where I can.”",,254,"{'like_count': 138, 'comment_count': 74, 'num_users': 100098}",Bulldogs 4 Life,,2023-10-14 22:31:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338035587_2920225021442036_1194138958643389704_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=aHpm4GSrchoAX-wicOk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCiJq3wm1ICbqU08brE6AkgAw_g33mdzxC-imarHM2YuA&oe=655AC5EF,https://www.facebook.com/100075896211285/posts/346379134568624,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391613528_346379104568627_8663125634123987081_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Prkt6CqP0zAAX855Xbc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCLWQ4Jp_yQwNBgffu69m0YIeLCcOEm9Ql-MoHJd7QY9g&oe=65311474
facebook,"📷: Palestinians wait to buy bread outside a bakery, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip October 14, 2023. 👉Israel’s military has announced a roughly six-hour window for Palestinians to continue fleeing south along specified routes inside of Gaza, as thousands vacate their homes following evacuation orders ahead of a possible Israel Defense Forces ground assault. “Follow our instructions — move south of Wadi Gaza,” said IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht during a Saturday news briefing, suggesting residents who remain north of that geographic location may be faced with a possible Israeli offensive. IDF officials also told the residents in northern regions they could continue to travel south on the territory’s main highways Saturday “without any harm” until 4 p.m. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed early Friday that it had notified residents in Gaza City to leave for ""their own safety and protection"" after it vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters stormed through towns and villages in southern Israel last week, killing 1,300 Israelis, mainly civilians, and making off with scores of hostages. ""You will be able to return to Gaza City only when another announcement permitting it is made,"" IDF spokesperson Lt. Col.

facebook,"Have you ever come across a historic gravesite on the Payette National Forest? Usually, these sites have an identifiable marker, such as a headstone, wooden sign, or fence. The Heritage Program maintains approximately 15 historic gravesites and cemeteries across the forest, to memorialize those individuals and honor the history across the landscape. “Maintaining gravesites is an act that goes beyond historic preservation, it also connects us with people in the past, as we often share experiences despite the distance of time,” said Morgan Zedalis, Forest Archaeologist. The Heritage Program, along with the help of volunteers or local youth programs, visits about three gravesites a year to do maintenance. Maintenance typically consists of trimming overgrown brush, repairing fences, and repainting signs. This fall, heritage staff repaired the fence at Deadman’s Bar, using native materials found near the site. Zedalis hopes to replace the fence next year, with materials and a design able to withstand the heavy snow load. Typically, historic gravesites are associated with homesteaders and miners and the Heritage Program utilizes archives and references to document the history of the people who are buried on the Forest. Sometimes that search produces a great deal of information, in other cases very little information, and sometimes information is conflicting and is not supported by much evidence. In such cases, archaeologists document all of the information as possibilities. “In the case of Deadman’s Bar on the East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River, there is one account for the site that Chinese miners and Euro-American miners had a conflict whereby four people died at the site. Another account is that a Union Civil War veteran named James Reagan was buried there in 1877,” said Zedalis.",,248,"{'like_count': 202, 'comment_count': 12, 'num_users': 19411}",U.S. Forest Service - Payette National Forest,,2023-10-14 01:00:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/272686884_271427885078601_6624129702685882751_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nXLwebjIhlIAX-WpYv1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBJApdIFvQlUKinENfavE5TCwyJZiVSvJqAa6psCFih4A&oe=655A9C54,https://www.facebook.com/100066341749133/posts/655757413312311,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387870785_655756599979059_440756396231615597_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=WT2kiUwWRAwAX-zWowH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC0erB2ceaZGpV61bgNsmG8qD0rUan5IRYYxgSTPzBYWQ&oe=655A2EAE

facebook,"MANIČNA PROIZVODNJA VIŠKA POVIJESTI Trenutno se u svijetu proizvodi gomila viška povijesti. Kopaju se rovovi, zauzimaju se strane.. Nedavno sam bio u Izraelu i snimao prve kadrove za novi i posljednji Gazda film: Isus Krist naš svagdašnji i svjedočio iz prve ruke o bodljikavom suživotu. Nabasao sam na Twitteru (X- jel) na (poooodužiiiii) status Židova Isaaca Saula u kojem neostrašćeno iznosi svoj stav o situaciji u Izraelu: https://twitter.com/ike_saul/status/1711780282725011520 Status je do sad vidlo preko 18milijuna. Držim da je vrijedan i prenosim ga u cijelosti. Twitter: Isaac Saul @Ike_Saul People ask me all the time if I am ""pro-Israel"" because I am a Jew who has lived in Israel, and my answer is that being ""pro-Israel"" or being ""pro-Palestine"" or being a ""Zionist"" does not properly capture the nuance of thought most people do or should have about this issue. It certainly doesn't capture mine. I have a lot to say. I’ve spent the last 72 hours writing, texting, and talking to Israelis, Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians. Much of my reaction is going to piss off people on ""both sides,"" but I am exhausted and hurting and I do not think there is any way to discuss this situation without being radically honest about my views. So I'm going to try to say what I believe to be true the best I can. Let me start with this: It could have been me. That's a hard thought to shake when watching the videos out of Israel — the concert goers fleeing across an empty expanse, the hostages being paraded through the streets, the people shot in the head at bus stops or in their cars. I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured. I don’t believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They're doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They're doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood — an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic — it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it. It’s not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should — far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I'll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me. In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it’s messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they’d later try to renege on — all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948. That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas — like Alaska — or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn’t want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel. The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react (truncated)",,246,"{'like_count': 190, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 49112}",Gradonačelnik svemira,,2023-10-14 10:32:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/241360492_386565182844742_2846296556869667409_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6H5FMNoN5XgAX9RZ3LH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDfx07XQtDkUf9UcmHz0NxwfyR-KhQv7qTFkOdCSwrp7g&oe=655A6F6D,https://www.facebook.com/100044737904457/posts/848315880003001,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391679733_848309720003617_8278953016929284576_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=aYWMFJ8oQssAX-Hvgx1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDz7C8BHHUPuuyGrGi4r5_C19jGoIYlWFw_4fCtExcQuQ&oe=65597AA7

facebook,"Calvin Seward and Todd Steffy presented their case to the prosecuting attorney last week. TAPD is expected to make an announcement soon so we will finally know who the monster was that committed this heinous crime against Karen and Gordon Alexander in April 1981. Karen, 14 and Gordon, 13 Alexander were brutally attacked April 8, 1981 in their home in the Carmichael Hill area of Texarkana, Arkansas. (501 Baden Street) Gordon was killed immediately and Karen lived 3 days in a coma and passed away April 11. Gordon was confined to a wheelchair at the time due to hip surgery a month and a half prior to the attack. The children were brutally stabbed multiple times each and was described as the worst crime scene that any of the officers had ever seen in their law enforcement careers. The murder weapon used was a butter knife. A crime scene team was later created in Texarkana because of this case. https://truecrimetxk.castos.com/episodes/episode-2-the-shadow-of-death https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/02/28/Lucas-indicted-in-teens-death/7744204256091/ https://www.upi.com/amp/Archives/1981/04/14/A-teen-age-girl-and-her-wheelchair-bound-brother-were-stabbed/3516356072400/ The notorious Henry Lee Lucas was taken to the home at Baden Street and claimed to have killed the children, but it was later determined he was in Florida at the time of the murders. He had confessed to a plethora of murders across the United States that he could not have committed due to a conflict of his known locations. He was wanting to claim the murders so he could claim notoriety as the serial killer with the highest number of murders. Therefore, many killers across this country literally got away with murder. Thankfully, DNA is proving Henry Lee Lucas wrong quite often. (Lucas Report is located in the FILES section on the In Memory of Karen and Gordon group page) Their mother Vera Jeanette Lynch Alexander was in the hospital and their father Weldon “Hip” Alexander was working a graveyard shift at Cooper Tire at the time of the brutal attack. Their father arrived shortly after 7 a.m. to find his children had been attacked in their home in the Carmichael Hill area of Texarkana, Arkansas. A man driving a blue truck was seen leaving the house before their father arrived home. Tire track impressions were found in the driveway where the truck had been seen by the Hopkins family who lived across the street. Mark Hopkins interview is in the second podcast released by the Texarkana Gazette ""The Alexander Children's Murder"". https://truecrimetxk.castos.com/episodes/episode-2-the-shadow-of-death Karen and Gordon fought for their lives so the perpetrator of this crime would have had scratches on their hands and arms. Possibly cuts to the hand as well caused by the slippery butter knife. The suspects brought in early on would have been eliminated by the absence of scratches or cuts. Many family members and friends were questioned as well. Their mother Vera committed suicide on March 20, 1984 just over 3 years after the murders at the age of 37. Their father Weldon passed away November 6, 2014. Weldon always wanted to see their murders solved before he died according to his family. With the advancement and use of genealogy, hopefully the murders of these two children can be brought to justice in the near future. Please share our story with other's to help solve this case.

facebook,"Worshippers gathered at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Friday to hold prayers, amid the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Palestinians living in the northern Gaza Strip scrambled Friday as the clock ticked down on an Israeli order to evacuate to the southern part of the Strip within 24 hours ahead of what many fear will be a major Israeli ground offensive into the Hamas-controlled territory. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed early Friday that it had notified residents in Gaza City to leave for “their own safety and protection.” “You will be able to return to Gaza City only when another announcement permitting it is made,” IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said in a livestreamed briefing on the social media platform X. “Do not approach the area of the security fence with the state of Israel.” Hamas, however, has called for everyone to “remain steadfast in your homes and to stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation,” according to the Associated Press. Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters Friday that Israel’s evacuation order amounts to “ethnic cleansing” of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have nowhere to flee. https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-un-northern-gaza-should-evacuate-within-24-hours/7309227.html",,241,"{'like_count': 150, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 13090753}",Voice of America,,2023-10-14 06:00:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352992991_178766095145684_5027481947854717491_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=18ZZdScV7x8AX_v3UtK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA-0oRGDfzOgJKAktJbxD6u7JzyNcJUAbbN0bpHjZ8-Q&oe=655A6AC2,https://www.facebook.com/100064458353336/posts/711589074333031,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/386468406_340768561954466_6738973221867141764_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=Qs7_im14v9UAX-llEMD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAliVbZZ-CKdafeMeHi1IIFxIJTpoIautxTy-NylayxwQ&oe=65466918

facebook,"OPEN HEAVENS DEVOTIONAL DATE: SUNDAY OCTOBER 15 2023 TOPIC: THE LAND OF ENDLESS SUFFERINGS MEMORISE: And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Matthew 13:42 READ: MATTHEW 13:24-30, 36-43 24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. MESSAGE: Those who don't end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ""And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."" All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: ""Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."" The passage does not say 'the worm' does not die, but 'their worm'. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire. There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely. REFLECTION: Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell becasuse of that sin you keep committing? If not, stop it today. BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: MARK 6-7 AUTHOR: PASTOR E.A.

facebook,#BREAKING UPDATE: I have CONFIRMED that there was no request for a DNA swab or otherwise from Mohbad’s corpse after his death while his body is still in custody of Pathologists and investigators. A fake tweet sponsored by mischief makers online had several twitter influencers posting but Nobody could even post that DNA 🧬 result because it did not exist. Mohbad’s dad told BBC that he attempted to kill 👀his son Liam by drowning him in a river days before his death. Nobody knew what was going thru his mind. I also confirmed that his mother-in-law does NOT pose a conflict of interest in the case as a policewoman. Wunmi’s mom is retired 👮🏼 The events unfolding in #Justice4Mohbad is bizarre. Please don’t allow social media sentiments and media trials to brainwash and consume you. I will continue to brief you on pertinent information. @2222MediaSchool on X and here.

facebook,"The Heiðinn Chronicles

""It is not always hate or anger which stirs us to weapon play, but more often justice and defense, honor and retribution, love of friend, family, home, and care of livestock. Many times blood is shed because it is the right thing to do, the honorable thing to do; just as often blood is shed because one did not draw blade, but instead tried to bargain with one's Wyrd. The Norns cannot be negotiated with, accept your Wyrd, meet it bravely, let the blood spill where it will. 

The Way of the Heiðinn is the Way of acceptance of these things. We are not meek, not weak, nor do we refrain from conflict. There are many other Walks in life that do ask one to refrain from strife however. Those Folk will always have need of those that will Stand.  

This is good, it gives us balance, all are welcome to the Way which best serves them. Find yours, walk the Path which was meant for you, share your home, your wealth and your time. Many a Wayfarer will visit an open hearted man."" - Guðfrith Rygisson",,230,"{'like_count': 215, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 94202}",FRANK FRAZETTA FANS,,2023-10-14 20:27:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/14962604_10210940612489296_2243182279286175665_n.jpg?stp=c15.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=zCY3UwtwxugAX_gaDBh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA8BlAFZ5ke8mF3kcazPgqpFTOrgoF0vHrjJWB_PKAurg&oe=657D3065,https://www.facebook.com/groups/2226395949/permalink/10160866438215950,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387734808_818466220280810_1545330773673764279_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EWq_8V3v3wAAX_y6s0s&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDp3E4UF6IEN63tgsY_6t9veNvYEMTxJRiXscpEXTs_gA&oe=65316BBD

facebook,"***Saturday 14th October 1066*** 957 years ago, at 9am, the Norman invasion force led by Duke William 'The Bastard', launched an assault against the massed Anglo-Saxon ranks of King Harold Godwinson at 'Battle' near Hastings in Sussex. The Anglo-Saxons held a dominant position on the top of Senlac Hill. Throughout the struggle, the Normans tried to break that fearful line and the result lay in the balance until late in the day. The conflict ended at around 7pm, following the death of King Harold; it was a very bloody contest. After the battle, William began a lengthy campaign to bring England under his control. During the next 21 years, there were massive transfers of land and power in favour of the Normans and English people were completely disenfranchised. A huge building programme began and the landscape was changed enormously. A new culture and a revised language evolved. In short, the Battle of Hastings, brutally and dramatically, changed the course of England's history.",,223,"{'like_count': 124, 'comment_count': 65, 'num_users': 94964}",Medieval England,,2023-10-14 06:17:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/13138923_10154326411394050_100412666832181050_n.jpg?stp=c42.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=i5p7G_L4ZlAAX9oMZ36&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDwYQa_PZLbrPyziqsDwmPpvVewcDk_JjVffRyjXz1U4Q&oe=657D16EE,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1680627865521217/permalink/3403916723192314,https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392781547_6836116173098989_9166238479245793691_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6pKsUZHU_c8AX_DOK1K&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AfDYWPXP44I_afU8a3bTtzcjKUThNmpxS_N2kn44_wkveQ&oe=65360C53
facebook,"Michael Corleone was not as good of a leader as his father. Not really even close. That’s from where a lot of the tragedy of the story stems. Vito Corleone was a man born into the right era. As tragic as the experience was of seeing his entire family murdered, it ultimately shaped his psyche into exactly what it took to be the greatest head in the underworld. After fleeing to America and following a brief attempt to live an honest life, Vito eventually grew into the role he was always meant to assume, as the don of the most powerful crime family in America. Vito also worked his way up from the very bottom of the underworld, and, having been in the trenches, was held in high regard by his lieutenants and subordinates. And, critically, Vito knew how to use violence only as necessary. He never believed in wiping out everyone, not even just his enemies. Vito believed in keeping friends close and enemies closer. As such, his men and the men in other families feared Vito, but also respected him. Michael’s track was different. He never truly embraced the family business, a major divergence in character from his father. While Vito never apologized for the life he chose, Michael’s greatest wish was to take the Corleone Family legitimate, an indication that Michael didn’t ever truly respect his roots. So, he was more ruthless than his father, willing to destroy all of his enemies, even if that meant his own brother. It’s one of the points of conflict that Michael and Tom Hagen discuss in the boathouse when Michael asks Tom if he will go along with Michael in these things Michael planned to do. Vito had taught Sonny and Tom to be light-handed when it came to violence, yet here was Michael trying to annihilate anyone who said a word against him. One thing about The Godfather Saga that probably gets overlooked or simply missed is, Michael was killing a lot of people by the end of the second film. When mobsters get to a point where they are that ruthless, there’s a tendency for the other families to band together and get rid of the cutthroat. This never occurs in the films. We’re sort of led to believe that the other heads of the Five Families and the Commission are fine and dandy with all of Michael’s actions. Realistically, there would likely have been a coup within his own family, or Michael would have been taken out the same way Vito took out Giuseppe Mariposa in the early 1930s, when Mariposa was murdering anyone he thought was against him. Michael’s men feared him, but I never got the sense he was respected like his father. He may have lived a long life, but he was also never close to being the leader Vito was.",,222,"{'like_count': 188, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 289313}",The Godfather's Quotes,,2023-10-14 16:48:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/29497130_2491060317578166_1534998197923541304_n.jpg?stp=c20.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=eVLTCdvdgJIAX_RYNgW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCuveYaWNcnrNrmCzX-UbwQP0v9XyO4SZHauB3wOlFN5w&oe=657D3435,https://www.facebook.com/groups/230561134167302/permalink/1444846119405458,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387826318_6659887704088516_667052541447194823_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=qek2eBKFcQ0AX-gfGwJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAI4TLMAVOeZeg-C2Bo8uJBs3TrQD5urTd1t6ukrhfPIw&oe=652F3C37

facebook,"Dorothee Pullinger {Pioneering car designer at the Paisley Arrol-Johnston car works.} Dorothée was born in France in January, 1894. Her father was the car designer Thomas Pullinger and Dorothee followed him to become a pioneering automobile engineer in a man’s world. As well as being credited with designing the first car “for women”, Dorothee was also one of the founding members of the Women's Engineering Society , and was a life-long member and active in the society's Council. In 1910, Pullinger began work in the Paisley-based Scottish automobile firm Arrol-Johnston (the building was previously the Underwood Mill ) where she worked as a draftsperson. Pullinger remained at Arrol-Johnston until the start of World War I when it changed from producing cars to aeroplanes. She was appointed female supervisor of the very large munitions facility operated in Barrow in Furness, where women were employed in the manufacture of high explosive shells. In 1916, her father created a new munitions facility at Arrol-Johnston near Kirkcudbright which included an engineering college for women and an apprenticeship program. In 1914 she was told she couldn't join the Institution of Automobile Engineers because ""the word person means a man and not a woman"". After the war, she returned to Scotland where the munitions facility was converted back to the manufacture of automobiles and renamed Galloway Motors Ltd , where she was a director and manager. The company produced a car, the Galloway, for Arrol-Johnston that was designed for women. Galloway was no ordinary company. It adopted the colours of the suffragettes, had two tennis courts on its roof for employees, and Dorothée hosted an engineering college there. Apprenticeships lasted three years for women rather than the usual five for men because, it was believed, women were faster learners. It was something that had never been done before, a completely new concept to have women actually producing a car and designing the car in a way that made it more useable for other women to drive by making the steering again lighter. The company employed a largely female work force under Pullinger's direction and produced automobiles until 1923 when production was transferred to Arrol-Johnston's Heathhall works, but within six years the cars were no longer produced. Only 4,000 of the vehicles were ever made, with a model in Glasgow's Riverside Museum thought to be the only one on public display in the United Kingdom. After the conflict of the First World War she was finally accepted to the automobile institution as its first female member and awarded an MBE for her war work. She was an enthusiastic race car driver and won the cup in the Scottish Six Day Car Trials in 1924. Dorothée left the car manufacturing business after a spell of working as a sales representative for Arrol-Johnston. According to her children, she eventually became fed up with of people telling her she was ""taking a man's job"". In a complete change of direction Dorothee set up the White Service Laundry company in Croydon. During World War Two, she served her country once again. She was the only woman appointed to the Industrial Panel of the Ministry of Production, addressing post-war industry problems. After the conflict, she settled in Guernsey and established another laundry business. She passed away in 1986, aged 92. For Dorothée's children, she was a just a woman who tried to do the job she loved but believe their mother had it tough in Edwardian Britain. ""Life is a challenge and you go for it,"" said her 84-year-old son Lewis, from his home in Guernsey in 2016. Dorothée's daughter, Yvette Le Couvey, said her mother spent a long time convincing Thomas Pullinger to let her work in his field. ""I'm very proud,"" said daughter Yvette, who is now 93. ""She achieved things - how many other women achieved what she achieved? It is all a question about going forward.""

facebook,"#OPINION No place for disrespect: All leaders in South Sudan deserve respect The people of Jonglei State were rightly upset last week to hear reports of disrespectful behavior directed at their Governor, H.E. Denay Jock Chagor, by first deputy speaker Rt. Honourable Nathaniel Oyet during a parliamentary session. According to witnesses and televised excerpts from the session, Rt. Honourable Oyet, and the TNLA spokesperson launched personal insults and baseless accusations against Governor Chagor. However, we must remember that Governor Chagor, like all signatories to the 2018 Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan, made compromises and commitments to establish sustainable peace in our nation. The agreement was the culmination of lengthy negotiations to end the devastating civil war that had cost so many lives. While political disagreements will always exist in a democracy, the signatories to the peace deal all recognized that open dialogue and respect must replace violence if South Sudan is to have any hope of a just future. Verbal abuse has no place in democratic governance or reconciliation processes. While policy issues with a governor's leadership can certainly be raised through appropriate formal mechanisms, hurling insults from the parliamentary floor damages our fragile democratic institutions and poisons the environment for the resolution of issues. The people of South Sudan have suffered tremendously from violence. Our leaders must set a positive example of resolving differences peacefully and respecting one another. For the sake of continued peace and stability, all parties to the 2018 agreement deserve our respect as long as they uphold their commitments to the democratic process and peacebuilding. Personal attacks have no place in moving our nation forward. The people of Jonglei state condemn the language used by some of the parliamentarians against the governor on the floor of TNLA during the summoning session on Tuesday, October 3rd, 2023. If the first deputy speaker and some members of the TNLA have policy issues with the Governor's leadership, there are appropriate formal mechanisms for addressing them through respectful dialogue and peaceful means.

Spending the day playing with my child and being reminded of how simple it could be, she says hello to everyone, doesn’t see race or religious identity, doesn’t judge or condemn basking in the glory of innocence. It’s hard to fathom that innocence is our birthright in a world as divided as ours, and of course it’s naive, but we have to find that sacred innocence in ourselves and each other and see how we are one. The world appears to be telling us that the soul of humanity is in critical condition and when the damage escalates it quickly will be out of control if it’s not already.

facebook,"Kojima explains the reason for choosing the name “Snake” in Metal Gear Solid. The entire Metal Gear Solid series is full of snake names, but have you ever wondered why Hideo Kojima, the main developer of the series, chose this name to symbolize the heroes of the series? Well, Kojima finally decided to explain the reason through his account. On Twitter, Kojima said that the reason for using the snake as a code name in Metal Gear Solid is because it is the appropriate nickname for a person who is good at hiding, hiding traces, and can pounce on the victim without causing any noise. He also added that he did not use any specific names such as the cobra snake, the anaconda snake, and others because he believed that the hero would be the player himself and the method of play that he would follow. Kojima also explained that he used the word “solid” to give the player a sense of solidity, which is the opposite of something soft and weak. He also said that a snake can bite and attack another snake, and from this standpoint he got the idea of the conflict between the characters “SOLID SNAKE” and “LIQUID SNAKE”. Then Kojima thought of introducing a third character, and after using the cases of solid and liquid materials, he found no way except to reveal Another character has the third state of matter, which is gas, but the name of the character “Gas Snake” did not appeal to Kojima very much, so he decided to delve into physics more and come up with the name “Solidus,” which is a substance between a solid and a liquid. #admin #progames #shady",,201,"{'like_count': 126, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 89912}",METAL GEAR SOLID,,2023-10-14 18:27:49,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/310390452_10228506889721122_1232285222880812277_n.jpg?stp=c6.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yJrCIhZJWG0AX8cPLx2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBDm1yQpYTNkFnYiX3fkg93RWILvzXDdAxymWnsV_FQDg&oe=655A705D,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1622187958032427/permalink/3456548654596339,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/384259937_990169988942780_8810100279864296102_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jdFcAWu_Q10AX9tPV1O&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBzv5NFy4plIE8tCPd9ehxCoOesxbLiSvyx98O8jyNLNA&oe=652F6103

facebook,"Have you ever come across a historic gravesite on the Payette National Forest? Usually, these sites have an identifiable marker, such as a headstone, wooden sign, or fence. The Heritage Program maintains approximately 15 historic gravesites and cemeteries across the forest, to memorialize those individuals and honor the history across the landscape. “Maintaining gravesites is an act that goes beyond historic preservation, it also connects us with people in the past, as we often share experiences despite the distance of time,” said Morgan Zedalis, Forest Archaeologist. 

The Heritage Program, along with the help of volunteers or local youth programs, visits about three gravesites a year to do maintenance. Maintenance typically consists of trimming overgrown brush, repairing fences, and repainting signs. 

This fall, heritage staff repaired the fence at Deadman’s Bar, using native materials found near the site. Zedalis hopes to replace the fence next year, with materials and a design able to withstand the heavy snow load. 

Typically, historic gravesites are associated with homesteaders and miners and the Heritage Program utilizes archives and references to document the history of the people who are buried on the Forest.

In such cases, archaeologists document all of the information as possibilities. “In the case of Deadman’s Bar on the East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River, there is one account for the site that Chinese miners and Euro-American miners had a conflict whereby four people died at the site.

facebook,"A word from Pastor Carlos A. Morales Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I want to address the recent rallies that have taken place in various parts of the world in support of Hamas. It is essential that we, as Christians and followers of Christ's teachings, engage in discussions and promote understanding on this matter. However, it is equally important to clarify our stance, as it may have been misinterpreted. First and foremost, we must make it clear that our opposition is directed towards terrorism and not against any specific group of people, including the people of Palestine. Our faith teaches us to love our neighbors and seek peace. It is in this spirit that we must approach complex and sensitive issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is undeniable that Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by many nations and international bodies due to its violent actions and extremist ideologies. We condemn acts of terrorism and violence wherever they occur, as they bring suffering and pain to innocent lives. However, it is crucial to remember that not everyone who identifies as Palestinian supports or is involved in the actions of Hamas. The Palestinian people, like any other, consist of a diverse range of individuals with different beliefs, aspirations, and experiences. Blanket judgments do not serve the cause of peace, understanding, or reconciliation. Let us strive to distinguish between the actions of extremist groups and the aspirations of ordinary people, recognizing their rights and humanity. We should pray for peace, justice, and reconciliation in the region, understanding that the path to lasting peace is complex. In conclusion, while we denounce terrorism and violence, let us also extend our love, compassion, and prayers to all those affected by conflict, including the people of Palestine and Israel. As Christians, our calling is to be peacemakers and agents of reconciliation, seeking God's wisdom and guidance in these challenging times. In Christ's love, Pastor Carlos Art by Bansky Matthew 22:36-40 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” 37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’[a] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”",,196,"{'like_count': 55, 'comment_count': 12, 'num_users': 415041}",Warrior Women,,2023-10-14 15:33:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/397189535_899400831559121_6639168616395005204_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=5DACkG_eCuUAX8eOIbM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB-HPilU8OBVrY6DvjAElbo-nolqaS-cm-FqvwK464-hw&oe=655A71E1,https://www.facebook.com/100044676363035/posts/888413685991169,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386537951_888413702657834_740994339715090442_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ZB38u9pZITQAX9g18Yi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCZuGm28LD0DnedidGAXnLBekCLV0R02drN2cEenMWyeQ&oe=653E5308

facebook,"Ang Palestine ay  lugar ng mga Propeta.
Walang karapatan ang mga hudyo sa Palestine
Puno’t dulo ng pangyayari
Ang Palestine ay para sa mga Palestino
Ang Jerusalem ay kapitolyo ng Palestine
Walang bansang Israel

Ilan sa mga Propeta na nanirahan dito ay si:

Ibrahim(Abraham)
Lut(Lot)
Ismael(Ismail)
Ishaaq(Isaac)
Ya’qoob(Jacob)
Yusof (Joseph)
Daud(David)
Sulaiman(Solomon)
Zakariyyah(Zacarias)
Yahya(John) 

{May the peace and blessing upon them)

Si Ibrahim ang anak nya ay dalawa: 
1.Si Ismael
2.Si Isaac

Ang anak ni Isaac ay si Jacob(Ya’qoob) kung saan ang karamihan sa mga Propeta ay nagmula sa kanyang angkan tulad ni Yusof(Joseph),Daud(David),Sulaiman(Solomon),Zakariyyah(Zacarias),Musa(Moses)Yahya(John). 

Ang pangalawang pangalan ni Propeta ishaq(Isaac) ay ISRAEL kaya tinatawag ang kanyang mga angkan na BANU ISRAEL(Son’s of Israel). 

Ngunit nakilala na ang angkan ni Israel sa pagsuway at katigasan ng ulo kung saan sila ang kumakalaban at pumapatay sa mismong mga Propeta na ipinadala sakanila maliban sa kakaunting bilang na mga nanamapalataya sakanila kasama ang mga Propeta,ganito ang pagdescribe ng Quran sakanila.

Kabilang sa kanilang pagsuway ay: 
-Sinuway nila si Propeta Solaiman(Solomon)
-Sinuway nila si Propeta Musa(Moses) 
-Sinuway nila si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) 
-Sila ang pumatay kay Propeta Yahya(John)
-Sila ang pumatay kay Propeta Zacariah(Zacarias).

KAYA PINARUSAHAN SILA NG ALLAH KUNG SAAN ANG NAGING PARUSA NILA AY WALA SILANG LUPA SA MUNDONG ITO MALIBAN SA MGA NANANAMPALATAYA SAKANILA.

Ang nangyari sakanila sa loob ng ilang siglo ay kung saan-saan sila napadpad sa middles east pagkatapos ng panahon ni Propeta Eisa(Jesus),ang iba ay napunta sa Europe at America. 

Sa World War II sa pagitan ng taon 1941 at 1945 ay nangyari ang Holocaust kung saan namatay ang halos 6 millions na hudyo sa Europa sa kamay ni Adolf Hitler ng Germany. 

Ang dahilan ng malaking galit na ito ni Adolf Hitler sa mga hudyo ay tungkol sa political at religion kung saan ang paniniwala ng mga hudyo sa mga taong hindi kabilang sakanila ay mga hayop o pinakamababang nilalang,dahil nga naniniwala sila na sila nga ang chosen people na pinili ng Allah,kaya ginawa ito sakanila ni Hitler.

Nagkaroon lang naman sila ng lupa sa Palestine dahil naawa ang GREAT BRITAIN sakanila kung saan nirekomenda ito sa UNITED NATIONS at agad naman ito natanggap ng UN sa taong 1947,sapagat matagal din nanilbihan ang mga hudyo sa Great Britain.

Sa sumunod na taon(1948) ay nagdeklara kaagad ang mga Zionist Jews ng kanilang sariling bansa sa Palestine na tinawag nilang ISRAEL kung saan parang kailan lng yung pagdating nila sa Palestine bilang mga refugees hanggang sa paunti-unti na nilang pinapalawak ang kanilang lupain sa pagsakop sa mga lupain ng mga palestino sa dahas at sapilitan na paraan,kasabay nun ay inipon nila ang lahat ng mga hudyo sa buong mundo kung saan dati-rati ay magkakawatakwatak dahil sa parusa sakanila ng Allah.

Dito na nanghimasok ang mga bansang Arabo at nagkaron ng digmaan na di matapos tapos hanggang ngayon sa pagitan ng mga JEWS at ARABS.

Bukod sa conflict na ito ay di rin ginagalang ng mga jews ang mga arabo dahil naniniwala silang mga alipin lng sila kaya hindi sila naniwala kay Propeta Muhammad SAW at madali lng sakanila pumaslang ng arabong Muslim. Bakit? 

Si Propeta Ismael na kapatid ni Propeta Isaac ay anak ni Hajar na pangalawang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim na dating kasambahay ni Sarah na nanay naman ni Propeta Isaac na unang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim(ayun sa kanilang kasaysayan).

At pagkatapos ng paghahari ng mga angkan ni Isaac kung saan ang pinaka huling Propeta sakanila ay si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) ay binigay naman ng Allah ang pangako na ito sa angkan ni Propeta Ismael kung saan magmumula sa kanyang angkan ang huling propeta at Sugo na si Propeta Muhammad SAW.

Dahil nga hindi nanggaling sa angkan ni Isaac ang huling Propeta ay hindi naniwala ang mga hudyo,sa paniniwalang mababa lng si Propeta Ismael kumpara sakanilang ninuno na si Propeta Isaac na anak mula sa unang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim,bukod doon ay talagang palasuway sila sa mga Propeta kahit noon pa.

Sa madaling salita,ang nangyayaring conflict sa pagitan ng Jews at Arab Muslims ay sa religion at history. 

Ang Palestine ay lugar ng mga arabong Muslim,at mga nanampalataya sa mga angkan ni Israel,hindi rito kabilang ang mga sumuway,di sila kabilang sa pangako ng Allah. 

Tatlo ang umiiral na relihiyon sa Palestine:
1.Judaism
2.Christianity
3.Islam

BAKIT HINDI KABILANG ANG MGA CHRISTIANS SA PALESTINE SA KAAWAY NG MGA PALESTINONG MUSLIM? 

Ang mga kristiyano ay hindi tulad ng mga hudyo,kung saan mas malala ang hudyo ngunit iisang lahi lng sila,tinuturing din ng mga hudyo na kaaway ang mga kristiyano dahil hindi naman talaga sila naniwala kay Propeta Eisa(Jesus), sila ang nagparatang kay Maria na nakagawa raw ng pangangalunya(Zinah) at si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) ay anak sa zinah kaya nangyari ang malaking himala mula sa Allah kung saan nagsalita si (truncated)",,191,"{'like_count': 82, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 39180}",BALIK ISLAM DAWAH GROUP,,2023-10-14 18:37:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/195975551_493353311948424_160437583963991216_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=R-FOmJGkMf0AX8cC3cK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA0vgsRllBmPOBULoLiT_RWmEMMJmoXcjuWJZRsBNU2ng&oe=657D2DF2,https://www.facebook.com/groups/146955832548152/permalink/1450700852173637,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392758021_662889199267750_101271494166371469_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=P323DRoQX8kAX-QH3EB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB0RG6Mlv1wcpiC_r4nkWKkpLIJusTZ3oLuDwU-_KLJsA&oe=652FCF2F

facebook,"Rogue Success Elk Cervus canadensis The last few weeks have had me booked up fairly solidly with fall portrait photography and subsequent editing, so it was a nice change of pace to awake well before dawn this morning and see how things were faring in the valley of the kings. The elk rut has wound down considerably and is mostly over, and as I arrived at my destination only scant bugling was to be heard, where it was seemingly constant only a few weeks ago. I made my way in the general direction of the calls, but the few that I had heard were far out in the middle of the valley and the elk were mostly still invisible in the pre-dawn light. From a distace I did catch sight of a small harem that I might be able to photograph once the sun arose a bit more, so I made my way out into the 20 degree morning with hopes of a large bull with his end-of-season prize. Upon my arrival I was a bit surprised to see this smaller bull rounding up a harem of about a dozen or so cows. I could still hear bugling coming from a larger harem in the middle of the valley doing a call and responce with another big bull I had spotted making his way into the forest in the dark, but this younger one kept himself conspicuously quiet. My guess is that he was successful in peeling off the cows from the larger harem in the dark of night and was carefully keeping them a safe distance from the very likely much larger herd bull to avoid conflict, and staying very quiet to ensure his own safety. He seemed a bit anxious, not unusual for rut behavior, but gave the impression that he was more nervous about raising the ire of the distant herd bull than he was about possibly mating. At one point he even took off at a decent trot, far away from the cows. I thought for a bit that his nerves had gotten the better of him and he decided to give up on his small prize, but about 10 minutes later he came prancing back with no larger bull in tow (yet keeping a close eye on the general direction of the larger harem) and returned to his pacing about the ladies. I enjoyed the company of this small gathering for the next half hour or so until the sun broke above the distant hills and it was time for me to continue my morning with breakfast and a grateful heart. https://jamesdewaltphotography.com:=:https://jamesdewaltphotography.com/ Canon 5DmkIII EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS USM 1/125s f/5.6 ISO 500",,190,"{'like_count': 137, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 20514}","James DeWalt Photography, Life In Nature",,2023-10-14 22:18:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/163071142_217829396473114_3823056081547903519_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=HhCm48RHTS8AX-YdvD3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAItvh4yKe3kzCLtOhvVOoDxrN2GjhRFeRd86K3A2pfig&oe=657D38D4,https://www.facebook.com/100047381658132/posts/899432598312787,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391556104_899432474979466_6939001218416405777_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=UIoymG8xbBsAX-ZwD24&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDcFSO5gQ9p3QnsfMti3Qt1sAkJ8-3IxMJCuoXL_87Fkw&oe=6559415D

facebook,"Imagini de pe strazile Hollywoodului. Încă o dovadă că guvernarea lui Lucifer ruinează viețile oamenilor și aduce numai dezastru și distrugere pe planeta Pământ. Mare conflict cosmic între Hristos si Satana este pe cale sa se încheie..Suntem #la #Final Apocalipsa 12:9,12 [9]Și balaurul cel mare, șarpele cel vechi, numit diavolul și Satana, acela care înșală întreaga lume, a fost aruncat pe pământ și împreună cu el au fost aruncaţi și îngerii lui. [12]De aceea bucuraţi-vă, ceruri și voi care locuiţi în ceruri! Vai de voi, pământ și mare! Căci diavolul s-a coborât la voi cuprins de o mânie mare, fiindcă știe că are puţină vreme.” Apocalipsa cap.20:1-15 [1]Apoi am văzut coborându-se din cer un înger care ţinea în mână cheia adâncului și un lanţ mare. [2]El a pus mâna pe balaur, pe șarpele cel vechi, care este diavolul și Satana, și l-a legat pentru o mie de ani. [3]L-a aruncat în adânc, l-a închis acolo și a pecetluit intrarea deasupra lui, ca să nu mai înșele neamurile, până se vor împlini cei o mie de ani. După aceea, trebuie să fie dezlegat pentru puţină vreme. [4]Și am văzut niște scaune de domnie; și celor ce au șezut pe ele li s-a dat judecata. Și am văzut sufletele celor ce li se tăiase capul din pricina mărturiei lui Isus și din pricina Cuvântului lui Dumnezeu și ale celor ce nu se închinaseră fiarei și icoanei ei și nu primiseră semnul ei pe frunte și pe mână. Ei au înviat și au împărăţit cu Hristos o mie de ani. [5]Ceilalţi morţi n-au înviat până nu s-au sfârșit cei o mie de ani. Aceasta este întâia înviere. [6]Fericiţi și sfinţi sunt cei ce au parte de întâia înviere! Asupra lor a doua moarte n-are nicio putere; ci vor fi preoţi ai lui Dumnezeu și ai lui Hristos și vor împărăţi cu El o mie de ani. [7]Când se vor împlini cei o mie de ani, Satana va fi dezlegat [8]și va ieși din temniţa lui ca să înșele neamurile care sunt în cele patru colţuri ale pământului, pe Gog și pe Magog, ca să-i adune pentru război. Numărul lor va fi ca nisipul mării. [9]Și ei s-au suit pe faţa pământului și au înconjurat tabăra sfinţilor și cetatea preaiubită. Dar din cer s-a coborât un foc care i-a mistuit. [10]Și diavolul, care-i înșela, a fost aruncat în iazul de foc și de pucioasă, unde sunt fiara și prorocul mincinos. Și vor fi munciţi zi și noapte în vecii vecilor. [11]Apoi am văzut un scaun de domnie mare și alb și pe Cel ce ședea pe el. Pământul și cerul au fugit dinaintea Lui și nu s-a mai găsit loc pentru ele. [12]Și am văzut pe morţi, mari și mici, stând în picioare înaintea scaunului de domnie. Niște cărţi au fost deschise. Și a fost deschisă o altă carte, care este cartea vieţii. Și morţii au fost judecaţi după faptele lor, după cele ce erau scrise în cărţile acelea. [13]Marea a dat înapoi pe morţii care erau în ea; Moartea și Locuinţa morţilor au dat înapoi pe morţii care erau în ele. Fiecare a fost judecat după faptele lui.

facebook,"“Identification with the aggressor” (or defensive identification) is an unconscious defence mechanism whereby a victim of aggression and suffering (an alienated child) aligns with and behaves like someone (the alienating parent), who is more powerful, hostile, poses a threat, or cannot be overcome. In this way, an alienated child will learn to lie and manipulate as their ‘winning’ and ‘stronger’ parent does. Alignment and identification with the bully/aggressor also helps to suppress deeper feelings of guilt, vulnerability and shame. It’s like Stockholm Syndrome when a hostage feels powerless and aligns with their captor. They start to feel gratitude towards the aggressor when they are kind and (conditionally) loving. Deep down, the child/hostage will be aware that their alienating parent isn’t particularly healthy-minded or loving. The child knows, from experience, this parent is unpredictable, selfish/narcissistic, volatile, they run hot/cold - their parenting involves reward/punishment. The children are parentified, their childhood sacrificed to the adult problems of the alienator, and their reaction to narcissistic wounding as a result of what is usually a high conflict separation or divorce. To love a parent like this the child often will ‘split’ in order to cope. To make the alienated parent the villain/baddie is to make their life easier in dealing with the painful experience of alienation, and no longer being allowed to spend time with a loving and loved parent. It’s to switch off, and totally align with the alienating aggressor. The child is actually afraid of the alienator, and they can partially conquer that fear by becoming more like them, and that pleases the alienator too, which means the child may be less abused. Also, when a child witnesses emotional, psychological (or physical) abuse of a parent, it’s intimidating, terrifying, confusing, upsetting, and as a survival tactic, they feel that it’s best for them to be with the terrorising parent, the one it seems unwise to fall out with. There will be consequences. They are afraid and feel they’ve lost one parent and don’t want to lose the other. What they see their alienating parent is capable of could be turned on them. The child ‘trauma bonds’ with the parent who poses the biggest threat. This is why the child feels negatively towards the things the alienator/aggressor is negative towards – it’s safer and easier to do so. They forget that their aggressor is really the origin of their suffering. I hope this goes some way to explain the phenomenon of why an alienated child supports, defends, loves and aligns with an abusive, mentally unstable parent while rejecting their more balanced and loving one. #parentalalienation #parentalalienationawareness #parentalalienationisreal #highconflictcoparenting #narcissisticchildabuse #alienatedparent #alienatedchild #rejectedparent #coercivecontrol #enmeshment #parentification #adultification #divorcesupport #custodybatt #fathersrights #mothersrights #charliemccready",,188,"{'like_count': 66, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 6386}",Empowering You To Overcome Parental Alienation Behaviors,,2023-10-14 11:05:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/360082093_7068703019810680_5411866649719286884_n.png?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mf8HpJA5obgAX9-BEOG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMjb8RPoXp92tezZj5D1uHIyHKBEy1GaeB_PZiF71t3A&oe=655B8E98,https://www.facebook.com/groups/3214325232164553/permalink/3493827704214303,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/382708197_7325067690840877_8213522736174903130_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=dbvP-WNH0IEAX_U0yaB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCCMn8Rs1Mr8zkcPwUmMTWPwylah3PYRai3cFsGeijMPA&oe=653048A4

facebook,"""In dealing with conflict, we should first contemplate that our adversary wants to be happy and be free from suffering, just as we do. 

Next, try to see things from their point of view. By looking at the situation from their perspective, we’ll be able to see clearly who has the mistaken idea, and who is in error. We will be able to see our own faults clearly, too. If, through this contemplation, we find that we are the ones in error, then we can begin to address those faults in ourselves. Should we confirm that yes, the other person is the one who is confused and at fault, we’ll still be able to see the situation with compassion. 

We’ll recognize that they are trying for happiness, but they misunderstand how to attain it. They might be harming us, and others too, yet we can understand that their behavior is actually impeding the happiness that they’re trying to achieve."" -Mingyur Rinpoche

facebook,"""It’s been a dreadful week. Humanity must prevail."" Statement by Martin Griffiths, United Nations Relief Chief, about the latest in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the region: ""Civilians in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory are suffering from a week of utter anguish and devastation. I fear that the worst is yet to come. In Israel, families are reeling from the horror of last Saturday’s attack. More than a thousand people have been killed and many more have been injured. Over 100 people are held captive. In Gaza, families have been bombed while inching their way south along congested, damaged roads, following an evacuation order that left hundreds of thousands of people scrambling for safety but with nowhere to go. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed and many more have been injured. There is no power, no water and no fuel. Food supplies are running dangerously low. Hospitals, overwhelmed with patients, are running out of medicine. Morgues are overflowing. Homes, schools, shelters, health centers and places of worship are under intense bombardment. Entire residential neighbourhoods have been razed to the ground. Aid workers have been killed. The humanitarian situation in Gaza, already critical, is fast becoming untenable. In the West Bank, violence is on the rise, with a surge in civilian deaths and injuries. Families are facing ever greater movement restrictions. And in Lebanon, the risk of the conflict spilling into the country is a major concern. The parties’ actions and rhetoric over the past few days are extremely alarming and unacceptable. Even wars have rules, and these rules must be upheld, at all times, and by all sides. Civilians and civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian workers and assets, must be protected. Civilians must be allowed to leave for safer areas. And whether they move or stay, constant care must be taken to spare them. Essential supplies and services and unimpeded humanitarian access must be allowed. Anyone held captive must be treated humanely. All hostages must be released. All countries with influence must exert it to ensure respect for the rules of war and to avoid any further escalation and spillover. The past week has been a test for humanity, and humanity is failing.""",,181,"{'like_count': 51, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 727661}",United Nations OCHA,,2023-10-14 17:23:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271692495_289665936527107_8510673323125230679_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IRmFY7zfPNgAX82ktHc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBwATBbNK3ly1NMkrVb8F4UVGxOShApCn8ZTD5t1adNjQ&oe=6559F478,https://www.facebook.com/100064511087483/posts/720206916806338,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391543226_720206886806341_372366854086883029_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=WMzhzNeFD0MAX94_QIM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAzCEBe8f5UXRanKTlBazlZS5xbxEVmHhdQBaDIlffN7Q&oe=6559F1B1

facebook,"OPEN HEAVENS DAILY DEVOTIONAL DATE: SUNDAY OCTOBER 15TH 2023 TOPIC: THE LAND OF ENDLESS SUFFERINGS MEMORISE: ""And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."" - (Matthew 13:42) READ: MATTHEW 13:24-30, 36-43 (KJV) 24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 42 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. MESSAGE: Those who don't end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ""And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."" All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: *""Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.""* The passage does not say 'the worm' does not die, but 'their worm'. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire. There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely. REFLECTION: Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell becasuse of that sin you keep committing? If not, stop it today. BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: MARK 6-7 HYMNAL: 20 - STAND UP! STAND UP FOR JESUS 1. Stand up! stand up for Jesus, Ye soldiers of the Cross! Lift high His royal banner; It must not suffer loss. From vict'ry unto vict'ry His army shall He lead, Till ev'ry foe is vanquished, And Christ is Lord indeed. 2. Stand up! stand up for Jesus, The trumpet call obey; Forth to the mighty conflict, In this His glorious day; Ye that are men now serve Him Against unnumbered foes; Let courage rise with danger, And strength to strength oppose. 3.

The promise’s to the Jewish people stands to this day. Apostle Paul said; “Did God reject his people? By no means!” (Romans 11:1). Paul also said; “You do not support the root, but the root supports you” (Romans 11:18). We are grafted in branches in the Olive tree, wich is Israel. They are our root. Let’s not cut our own tree down by standing on the wrong side, Biblically speaking, of this current conflict.

facebook,"Beach reading before the rain starts. In the spring of 1742, a Shawnee war party journeyed hundreds of miles to the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay to recruit allies for a war against the English colonists. The once-mighty but diminished Nanticokes, whose great-grandparents had greeted Captain John Smith with arrows, invited several other tribes—the Choptank, Assateague, Pocomoke, and Askecksy Indians—to meet at a place called Wimbesocom. A daring plan was proposed: With the help of hundreds of fierce northern warriors, the Eastern Shore tribes would carry out a surprise raid against their English neighbors and slaughter everyone-men, women, and children. Meanwhile, French forces would land on the coast and help them drive the white man off the peninsula, splitting the English colonies. If they succeeded, they would remake the destiny of North America. If they failed, they might lose their lands forever. 1742 traces the history of the Nanticoke Indians and other Eastern Shore tribes from their first contact with English colonists through decades of bloody conflict and bitter concessions, revealing a simmering resistance which boiled over during what historian C. A. Weslager called ""the most important single event in Indian history on the Delmarva Peninsula.”",,169,"{'like_count': 135, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 28710}",Uncharted Lancaster,,2023-10-14 13:22:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/326581467_544997164359966_3540870813995872140_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Q49Rthsf0o8AX93Mkqz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAY3GRVLrcgaWru_IG5qvpwJHBWrVUo53Fn7_lw9EzgxQ&oe=655B1D24,https://www.facebook.com/100053360694110/posts/848733573581991,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/358154263_848733553581993_8276035592491770452_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=VTSVQBn7do0AX-DF-XX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBHRGcSX50JTkLspXNpd4DaMY25l_jgUpJjna9AL4pa5g&oe=652EF973

facebook,"October 14 | Saint of the Day ➕ POPE SAINT CALLISTUS I Also known as • Callixtus I • Calixtus I Profile Born a slave, owned by Carpophorus, a Christian in the household of Caesar. His master entrusted a large sum to Callistus to open a bank, which took in several deposits, made several loans to people who refused to pay them back, and went broke. Knowing he would be personally blamed and punished, Callistus fled, but was caught and returned to his owner. Several depositors begged for his life, believing he had not lost the money, but had stolen and hid it. They were wrong; he wasn't a thief, just a victim, but he was sentenced to work the tin mines. By a quirk of Roman law, the ownership of Callistus was transferred from Carpophorus to the state, and when he was later ransomed out of his sentence with a number of other Christians, he became a free man. Pope Zephyrinus put Callistus in charge of the Roman public burial grounds, today still called the Cemetery of Saint Callistus. Archdeacon. Sixteenth Pope. Most of what we know about him has come down to us from his critics, including an anti-Pope of the day. Callistus was on more than one occasion accused of heresy for such actions as permitting a return to Communion for sinners who had repented and done penance, or for proclaiming that differences in economic class were no barrier to marriage. This last put him in conflict with Roman civil law, but he stated that in matters concerning the Church and the sacraments, Church law trumped civil law. In both cases he taught what the Church has taught for centuries, including today, and though a whole host of schismatics wrote against him, his crime seems to have been to practice orthodox Christianity. Martyred in the persecutions of Alexander Severus.

facebook,"In the midst of the horrors of the last week, it’s important to remember that Hamas has never wanted peace with Israel. Instead, the express goal of Hamas since its inception was the destruction of Israel. As stated in its first charter, published in 1988, “Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.” It was – and is – the mission of Hamas to obliterate Israel, not make peace with Israel. As noted in an October 10 article in The Atlantic, “A close read of Hamas’s founding documents clearly shows its intentions.” Accordingly, the headline was titled, “Understanding Hamas’s Genocidal Ideology.” Genocidal indeed. As even NPR acknowledges, “The group has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for many suicide bombings and other deadly attacks on civilians and Israeli soldiers.” And, just as Isis was a religion-based murder cult, the same holds true for Hamas. Both groups do what they do in the name of Allah, slaughtering the innocent in the cruelest, most demonic ways while shouting, “Allah Akbar.” (Raping women can also be done in Allah’s name in their demented form of faith.) That’s why you don’t make peace with the likes of Isis or Hamas. You thwart them. Put another way, people who proclaim, “We love death more than you love life” are not ready to sit down at the table and reason together. As Robert Spencer said with reference to Isis, “‘We love death more than you love life.' This is civilization's ultimate challenge. Will the lovers of death and destruction overwhelm and defeat those who love life and have created great civilizations that celebrate human creativity and achievement? Will all that is left of three thousand years of human civilization be reduced to rubble and a mindless religio-ideological lockstep? “The Islamic State is not just a challenge to Judeo-Christian Western civilization. It is a challenge to civilization itself--to the very idea of civilization. “And that is why it is doomed to fail. Life will always conquer death in the end. The human spirit will always prevail against the forces that would subjugate and enslave it.” Bear in mind that Hamas, an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya (“Islamic Resistance Movement”) was founded as a more religiously based front for resisting Israel. (As a point of clarification, the Arabic word hamas means “zeal” and is very close to the Hebrew word hamas meaning “violence.” But they are two distinct words, with similar, not identical pronunciations.) As noted on the Brittanica.com website, “Founded in 1987, Hamas opposed the secular approach of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and rejected attempts to cede any part of Palestine.” And while Hamas engaged in various acts of civil welfare for the people of Gaza, helping the populace in practical ways, it is the military wing of the organization that has made its lasting, deadly mark. It is also the military side of Hamas that absorbs the countless tens of millions of dollars that pour into its coffers from international aid that was intended for humanitarian use. Instead, it is used to build bombs and terror tunnels and the like. So much for being “for the people.” As far as the religious ideology of Hamas, understand that for a committed Muslim, the world is divided into two segments, Dar al-Islam, the territory of Islam, and Dar al-Harb, the territory of war. The former refers to those countries and lands that have been subjected to Islam (remember that “Islam” means “submission,” not “peace”). The latter refers to the rest of the world that has not yet come under the sway of Islam. And what happens to land that was once under Muslim control but that then breaks free, such as Spain after the Moorish Conquest? This becomes an open wound, a recurring taunt and insult. How much more, then, when the evil Jews now control Jerusalem, considered the third holiest site in Islam, not to mention the rest of former Palestine? Israel must be driven out! As stated in Article 12 of the original charter, “Nothing in nationalism is more significant or deeper than in the case when an enemy should tread Moslem land.” And so, when you hear that catchy chant, “From the River to the Sea, Palestine must be free,” it’s important that you understand what it actually means: “No more Jews in the Land! No more Israel!” Is that clear enough? That’s why the original Hamas charter quoted the famous, authoritative Islamic tradition (hadith) that stated, “The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: ‘O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.’” As for the revised charter published in 2017, one that toned down some of the language, the goals remained the same. To quote some relevant lines: “Palestine is a land that was seized by a racist, (truncated)",,165,"{'like_count': 82, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 584527}",Dr. Michael Brown,,2023-10-14 22:29:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/277796022_8004303829595149_3444591915280965641_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Ru1mboltmokAX85vEBc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBr7RPctAt2juc7rna8G3TF5a39wqXQpKLV0vphFe2lSQ&oe=655A3969,https://www.facebook.com/100064522336853/posts/706862194807852,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/7684082331119716868?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.britannica.com%2Fresources%2Fimages%2FEBLogo.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=britannica.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbGaCiyLmgu5N2eIevusY41EGhOgntQP02dHOII1OQk3gg&oe=6543EDD8
facebook,"***Saturday 14th October 1066*** 957 years ago, at 9am, the Norman invasion force led by Duke William 'The Bastard', launched an assault against the massed Anglo-Saxon ranks of King Harold Godwinson at 'Battle' near Hastings in Sussex. The Anglo-Saxons held a dominant position on the top of Senlac Hill. Throughout the struggle, the Normans tried to break that fearful line and the result lay in the balance until late in the day. The conflict ended at around 7pm, following the death of King Harold; it was a very bloody contest. After the battle, William began a lengthy campaign to bring England under his control. During the next 21 years, there were massive transfers of land and power in favour of the Normans and English people were completely disenfranchised. A huge building programme began and the landscape was changed enormously. A new culture and a revised language evolved.

facebook,"President Geingob issues a passionate plea for peace in Israel-Palestine conflict IN a heartfelt appeal, Namibian President Hage G. Geingob calls for an immediate end to the violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip, emphasizing the need to protect innocent lives and infrastructure. Statement reads as follows: President Hage G. Geingob appeals for peace between Israel and Palestine, calls for an end to the killing of innocent civilians and destruction of infrastructure in the occupied Gaza Strip President Hage G. Geingob is deeply concerned about the grave humanitarian situation in northern Gaza following deadly attacks by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) on innocent civilians, including women, children and civilian infrastructure, namely schools and hospitals. President Geingob re-emphasizes the fact that at the beginning of the 20th century, Namibians were killed on a large scale in a targeted and systematic manner by the German occupying colonial forces in what has been described as the first genocide of the 20th century. Therefore, as a country that has witnessed barbarity perpetuated against civilians by German occupying forces and later by Apartheid South Africa, President Geingob appeals to the international community and specifically the Israel to end the large-scale violence and horrendous airstrikes against the people of Gaza. The decision and order by the government of Israel for the people of northern Gaza to leave their homes and livelihoods within 24 hours is inhumane, it amounts to a genocidal act and must be rescinded. President Geingob maintains that the systematic state-sanctioned violence by the IDF in Gaza is wholly disproportionate and totally undermines international humanitarian law by failing to protect one million civilians, health workers and other critical infrastructure that is indispensable for the survival of the civilian population. “The people of Gaza have a right to water; they have a right to food and electricity; they have a right to fuel and other basic necessities”, President Geingob says. As an occupying power, Israel has an obligation to ensure that the people of Gaza have access to these services. Furthermore, the President believes that the state of siege and the military onslaught against innocent civilians amounts to a genocide and the international community cannot afford to be indifferent in the face of this human catastrophe that is unfolding. President Geingob once again reaffirms the call Namibia made to the 78th Session of the United Nations in September 2023 that the people of Palestine yearn to transition from the inhumane conditions of oppressive rule. While pleased with the decision of the General Assembly to submit to the International Court of Justice a request for an advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, President Geingob appeals to the United Nations Security Council to act swiftly to ensure respect of United Nations resolutions with regard to the right of the people of Palestine to live in peace and to determine their own future. President Geingob calls on both sides, including Hamas to desist from any horrific acts of violence that target civilians, leading to an escalation of the conflict. Moreover, President Geingob also calls for the release of hostages in accordance with international law. President Geingob restates, “one does not make peace with one’s friends, one makes peace with one’s enemies”. President Geingob also maintains that “when diplomacy fails, people go to war”. In that vein, President Geingob calls for an immediate ceasefire and appeals to all parties to return to the negotiating table and to pursue the moral path of a two-state solution in which the people of Palestine and Israel can live and co-exist as neighbours in peace and harmony. President Geingob extends a message of condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones, and wishes the injured a speedy recovery, during the ongoing, but avoidable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",,157,"{'like_count': 114, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 847577}",Informanté,,2023-10-14 12:29:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339304080_1587806651729329_1047479568050129584_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Ifk7oslw-x4AX_ogt0S&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfApgcHOcqVAJ7IG7FjWcE2w0QLmi7LrASSqaX5gQ5a6rQ&oe=655A1725,https://www.facebook.com/100069972069891/posts/618694530472944,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387872002_618690607140003_7183891261019077397_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eylkVf1WULIAX9-7J6v&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDrD5xAfBjNLQv3EeiyjhQy6qE075XKCbx2n0bYzeoDgw&oe=6530170F

facebook,"Saturday Morning. October 14, 2023 I was in Gaza during the second intifada. I was in Bethlehem with Hamas when the Palestinians chose to elect Hamas to represent them, instead of the more secular Fatah. During the George W Bush administration, the goal, or the idea, was to try to help Muslim governments become democracies by helping them to have democratic elections. We found out pretty fast that you can’t impose the American style of democracy on other peoples. I was in Hebron just after Palestinians murdered Jews as they walked to the Tomb of Abraham to worship on the Sabbath. I was in Bethlehem just before Christmas when the Israeli Defense Forces came in to Bethlehem and exploded the home of a suicide bomber next door to where I was staying. I was nearly kidnapped in Jericho. We were meeting with Christians in Jericho when we got word that intelligence reports say that Islamists were looking to kidnap Americans due to some Israeli incursion that had just happened. We were informed to get out of Jericho fast. I was there with a group of about 35 pro Palestinian activists from the World Council of Churches, the U.N., and from a Palestinian Christian organization based in Jerusalem. A car full of kidnappers came racing toward me and another woman, who was a leader of the World Council of Churches, from Ireland. I saw what was about to happen. She did too. By the grace of God, the Palestinian Christian priest, who lead the church we were meeting with that day, stepped in between us and our would be kidnappers. He explained to them that we were there to support the Palestinian cause. He probably saved our lives. We both got on our bus. The Irish World Council of Churches activist got off the bus in Israel proper, never to return to the Palestinian territories. She was scared to death. I, on the other hand, headed back to Bethlehem with the rest of my group. Bethlehem is totally controlled by Hamas. Hamas leaders were very nice and respectful to us. They saw us as being there in support of their cause. My group was there in support of the Palestinians. I was in Israel just after the siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem by Israel. There had been a bloody massacre of religious Jews while they were gathered together in a hotel banquet room in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover. Some of the Palestinians believed to be involved in the massacre, or the planning of the massacre, ran into the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem for protection and cover. Israel surrounded the church but could not extricate the militants without killing innocent Christians who were being held in the church by the militants. In the end the militants were allowed to leave the church and go to safe haven in one of the Arab countries. I can’t remember all the details. You cannot Google these stories and find the truth. All the information we can access on the internet that involves the conflict in Israel, as well as American politics, has been tainted by people in power from one point of view or another. You cannot trust what you read . My group was going to Bethlehem to stand with the Palestinians in protest of Israel’s siege of the Church of the Nativity. I did not feel inclined to protest Israel, or be involved in anyone’s protest, so I stayed behind, alone, and walked the streets of the Old City of Jerusalem. There I met a young Muslim man. I can’t remember his name right now, but we became fast friends. He took me all around the Old City introducing me to his friends and showing me hidden places, even hidden places on top of some of the most famous Christian churches in the Old City, like on top of the Church of the Resurrection. I asked my young Muslim friend what is his opinion of the epoch clash between Israel and Palestine. He said what he would do about it, is invite Ariel Sharon, then Prime Minister of Israel, over to dinner. They would sit down and work the problems between their two peoples out together, over a meal. That kind of Muslim does exist in Palestine. But so do the ISIS like murderers exist in Palestine. I feel very guilty that I have not done more, or anything, with my work for peace in the Holy Land. I was there often between 1998 and 2009. I was mostly there during the years my daughter was away at college and medical school. When my daughter had her first child my priorities changed. I stay here with my family now. I feel guilty because I had a calling to it and a talent for it. It is like my old friend James taught me years ago. Everything in life has it’s counter sacrifice. I could have stayed in The Holy Land. I had so many incredible experiences and opportunities, including job opportunities, that God’s hand must have been in it. But I chose Meadows of Dan because my family is here. I had to sacrifice one or the other. I did not have the inspiration or inclination back then, when I was in the Holy Land, to write stories, or make pictures, or stay in contact with the people I met, or (truncated)",,156,"{'like_count': 79, 'comment_count': 26, 'num_users': 21268}",Poor Farmers Market,,2023-10-14 14:30:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/326734828_3555175538098264_2925711098646762087_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YDR0FDRXXvgAX9ONKrJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCACH4lrGwb2_uiCwZdkCFuVWLQGFj051cWkoezqSKHsw&oe=655A9FA7,https://www.facebook.com/100057278236725/posts/829683005617633,

facebook,"Throughout the week I have been hearing from families in Saskatoon who are connected to Jewish and Palestinian friends and families in Israel and Gaza. The sense of grief and fear at what is unfolding is profound. It is simply awful to see this escalation of violence and displacement and to know how much it is impacting people here at home. Yesterday in the New York Times UN Secretary General Guterres wrote an Op-ed that really resonated for me. In it he says: “We have approached a moment of calamitous escalation, and find ourselves at a critical crossroads. It is imperative that all parties — and those with influence over them — do everything possible to avoid fresh violence or spillover of the conflict to the West Bank and the wider region. We urgently need a way out of this disastrous dead end before more lives are lost.” He went on to say: “It is clear that the ongoing upheaval in the Middle East is polarizing communities around the world, widening divides, and spreading and amplifying hate. If truth is the first casualty of war, reason is not far behind.” This moment is a profound test of our humanity. It is urgent that the international community work towards de-escalation of violence in the region, the protection of innocent lives, and as hard as it may seem, work to build a path towards peace and security for everyone in the region. #yxe",,153,"{'like_count': 73, 'comment_count': 21, 'num_users': 17990}",Mayor Charlie Clark,,2023-10-14 16:50:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/298955215_615111063340526_793364311244045918_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7mz-yEMjcOYAX-gE-xi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB1_Xzbhy1Tm1t0NXcQVJxzJEAkA8VDuVnbhBZ6qgqoSQ&oe=655A5513,https://www.facebook.com/100045249135412/posts/874191174099179,

facebook,"On Saturday, central London witnessed a significant gathering of protesters numbering in the thousands. Their unified demand was clear: they called for an immediate cessation of Israel's bombing campaign and the siege on the #Gaza Strip, all while expressing concerns about a potential ground invasion of this small #Palestinian territory. Unfazed by warnings against displaying the Palestinian flag, demonstrators assembled outside the BBC's New Broadcasting House to voice their condemnation of what they deemed ""Israeli aggression."" This demonstration unfolded amidst ongoing airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, which had persisted for an eighth consecutive day. Earlier that same day, BBC studios in London became the target of a protest, with the exterior of the building being splattered with red paint. This act was carried out in protest against the channel's coverage of the conflict. When Middle East Eye sought a response from the BBC, no comment had been received by the time of publication. This rally, organized by Friends of Al-Aqsa, the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), and other affiliated groups, resonated with pro-Palestinian voices. Chants of ""Israel is a terrorist state"" and ""free Palestine"" echoed as the protesters made their way from Regent Street, one of London's major shopping avenues, toward Westminster. In preparation for the event, more than 1,000 police officers were deployed, and the Metropolitan Police issued warnings. They cautioned that individuals showing support for Hamas, a group designated as a terrorist organization in the UK, or deviating from the approved protest route could face potential arrest.",,149,"{'like_count': 81, 'comment_count': 19, 'num_users': 1248116}",Middle East Monitor,,2023-10-14 16:34:37,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339495182_1378899545985188_9206592319587651336_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6P4Y1CMsl0IAX8Z5mRa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC74oBAFgwMeouOdtPN_jp5NoEe9r_JbVbjWDDx0cvR-w&oe=655AB2B3,https://www.facebook.com/100064501157337/posts/705060668320632,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391544735_705059591654073_4841505274388541493_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CKGONE3Fc6kAX-8YVq_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCPMuNA7WNFCgIRM6qeCLQYyr1zIYrc11fUho8JZhoLig&oe=653357F8

facebook,"Almost one week after the unprecedented terror attacks on Israel, by the militant Islamist group Hamas, Israeli troops have been carrying out localised raids inside Gaza. The military says infantry and tank units entered the strip to track down rocket crews, destroy weapons and search for hostages. The raids are taking place ahead of an expected ground offensive. Israel has massed troops and tanks along the Gaza border. Thousands of people are now attempting to flee their homes in northern Gaza. The Israeli military had given over 1 million people there just 24 hours to evacuate south. The United Nations has called the order ‘impossible,’ and the terror group Hamas is telling people to stay in their homes. But many Gazans have decided to risk the journey before a possible invasion. Israel has also exchanged rocket fire with Lebanon and Syria, opening up the possibility of a wider conflict. Could Israel handle a multi-front war? US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has wrapped up talks in Qatar. He’s been travelling around the region in an attempt to prevent the conflict widening. He began in Israel, to show support and discuss hostage negotiations. Blinken also met the Palestinian president in Jordan. He says it’s vital to contain the violence. – Localized raids’ in Gaza: A first step in Israel military’s ground offensive?

facebook,"Good Evening 💫 From a Christian perspective, emotional intelligence can be seen as a valuable and important aspect of one's character and behavior. Here is how. 📌 Love and Compassion: In Christianity, love is considered a foundational principle. Emotional intelligence aligns with this by emphasizing empathy and compassion. Understanding and responding to the emotions of others with love and kindness is consistent with Christian teachings. 📌 Self-Awareness and Humility: Emotional intelligence involves self-awareness, recognizing one's own emotions, and understanding how they impact behavior. This aligns with Christian teachings on humility and self-awareness, acknowledging one's own shortcomings and relying on God for guidance. 📌 Self-Control and Patience: Emotional intelligence includes the ability to manage and control one's emotions. In Christianity, self-control is often emphasized as a fruit of the Spirit. The ability to be patient and slow to anger, as encouraged in the Bible, is reflective of emotional intelligence. 📌 Relationships and Forgiveness: Christianity places a significant emphasis on forgiveness and building positive relationships. Emotional intelligence contributes to effective communication, conflict resolution, and building healthy relationships by understanding and managing emotions in oneself and others. 📌 Empathy and Understanding: Jesus, in his teachings and actions, often demonstrated empathy and understanding. Emotional intelligence encourages individuals to step into the shoes of others, to understand their feelings and perspectives, fostering a sense of unity and compassion. 📌 Communication and Truthfulness: Emotional intelligence involves effective communication and the ability to express emotions truthfully. In Christianity, there is an emphasis on speaking the truth in love. Emotional intelligence helps individuals communicate in a way that is respectful and considerate of others' feelings. 📌 Service and Sacrifice: Christianity often calls for a life of service to others and sacrificial love. Emotional intelligence supports this by enabling individuals to understand and respond to the needs and emotions of others, fostering a spirit of service and sacrifice. While emotional intelligence is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, many of its principles align with Christian values. The development of emotional intelligence can contribute to personal growth, positive relationships, and living out the teachings of Christianity in practical ways.

facebook,"Can you feel that?? That is tomorrow mornings Libra New Moon! It's the New Moon that signifies the change of seasons as things warm up and spring gardens begin to flourish. This represents a shift from a season of hibernation into a season of fertility and growth, from a season of self-focus into a season of collective contribution. The Libra New Moon will connect us to our heart encouraging balance while helping us detach from fear and ego based mindsets. The effect will be a release of internal conflict and power struggles in order to experience greater support and balance in relationships and partnerships. This concentration of authenticity-seeking energy suggests that this lunation is offering all of us a powerful opportunity to communicate our innermost, honest selves. This Libra New Moon is asking if you’re bold enough to wear your heart on your sleeve. Be vulnerable. Share your hopes and your hurts. This energy is an adventure in physical, emotional, and spiritual vulnerability for you. It may not look like a radical change on the outside, but this could be the New Moon that awakens a deeply healing inner transformation in you. One you’ve earned and deserve so use this New Moon to plant new seeds that will get you one step closer to making them real. Set strong intentions tonight and know that manifesting on a New Moon is the most powerful. This New Moon heralds a new season for us all. Are you ready? All my luna love. As always.

I’m here on behalf of the Canadian Coalition of Palestinian Organizations. I would like to reiterate the points made by my colleagues in speaking about two issues, both foreign and domestic. At the domestic level, our Palestinian community has been seeing vastly increased levels of harassment and threats. We have had Palestinian doctors had their ratings on Rate Your Doctor slammed with comments about how they are terrorists and support Hamas. Palestinians who own grocery stores have had their windows smashed. I myself have received hate and threatening messages. My wife recieved this message - we will rape your daughter and come for your terrorist husband. Let’s be clear. I’m sorry to say this - but it is your language and all of the politicians that followed - that opened the door to this nonsense. By not acknowledging the nuances of this conflict from the beginning you gave a green light to educators, companies, and provincial and municipal governments to look one way. You empowered Canadians to look at anyone who mentioned palestine as an enemy. That is how we feel and these are the effects we are facing now. Kids being kicked out of school because of voicing their support, employees feeling unsafe because of their companies vocal stance with Israel, mosques feeling under attack -- the list goes on. If you do not fix this language with an apology and clear messaging about the rights of Palestinians we worry that these acts will continue against people here in Canada. for generations to come. Internationally, I will say this. I was just in Palestine. And in the West Bank which is 10 times better than Gaza And you know this Prime Minister. Nothing sanctions what happened to innocent civilians. The occupation, and the horrors of civilian deaths, illegal settlements, attacks on journalist, repeated attacks on Al Aqsa mosque, spitting on Christian worshippers have made the situation less likely to result in peace for all civilians. All who commit crimes should be held accountable. The Palestinians want peace. They do not want war ships. We aren’t looking for bullets. We are looking for prosperity for all, justice for all, and an end to the conflict.

facebook,"To the Cafeteria Catholics on this thread bashing the Bishop over a Priest, this piece should be good for you to digest. Copied. OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTIES BY PRIESTS IN THE CHURCH: UNRAVELLING THE ISSUES BETWEEN REV. FR. PROF . PAUL OBAYI AND THE CHURCH/BISHOP ONAH I took time to watch the over 30-minute live video of Fr. Paul Obayi, narrating his painful ordeal in the hands of the Bishop and the Catholic Diocese of Nsukka. My takeaway from the video is that the good priest, who happens to be a Professor of Communication, taught by the same professors who taught me, seems to be having slight identity crises. This is because I am sure that the highly educated priest professor knows the true and authentic history of the Catholic Church. He must as well have been taught and properly drills on the events that led to the policies and dogmas of the church during his years as a philosophy and theology student. Even if he didn't, I am sure that some postgraduate classes with Prof. Ike. S. Ndolo or Propaganda Formulation and management should have clarified him a bit more. This knowledge acquired over time should have been more than enough to equip Fr. Obayi to understand that a priest of the Catholic Church does not have the right to own properties. Historically, the reason why Priests are not allowed to get married is not to keep them holy, no, it is to preserve the properties of the church so that the wives and children of priests won't grow to start demanding the transfer of the Church's properties to them. Before the year 1123, priests, bishops, and popes were allowed to have wives and children. However, upon their death, their children would take the church to court and reclaim all their father's properties, including church buildings. It became rampant that Catholic priests built churches and parish houses with people's donations and contributions to the church, only for their wives and children to throw the worshippers away and reclaim the church as their father's properties. To solve this problem, Pope Benedict VIII in 1018, formally forbade priestly marriages. About a hundred years later, it was formally adopted by the First Lateran Council of 1123. It would take nearly 300 years before it was fully implemented as most priests kept wives and children unofficially as house helps, since keeping them unofficially guaranteed that they won't take away the properties of the church through Court Litigations. Therefore, it is surprising for a priest who is exposed to such or even greater depth of knowledge to say that he owns any property. According to the Canon and Vatican laws, a priest owns nothing. A priest is as good as a dead man. Anything bought in his name was automatically bought in the name of the Church. Even his clothes and shoes. That's why it is the duty of the church to house him, clothe him, feed him, and provide everything he needs. Also, the church does not approve of a lot of things he does in the Adoration as the church sees them as superstitious acts and the preachings that when you throw powder, you may get favours, all sound heretic to the church. When I was president of the St. Theresa's Cathedral Parish Blockrosary Crusade, I took it upon myself to understand the faith I profess. So, I read about three different accounts of the history of the Catholic Church, some of which their authors include Alan Shrek and Rev. J. Dacruz. I understood in clear terms what the church was all about. So that in 2019/2020 when my understanding of the person and being of God began to conflict with the teachings of the Catholic Church, I voluntarily withdrew from being a practicing Christian, and only identify as a Christian for political reasons. Therefore, Fr. Obayi, whom I believe in all sincerity is more knowledgeable than me, should renounce priesthood peacefully if he has the intention of owning properties that are against the rules of the church. He should accept the treatments he is getting the way the priest governor happily accepted his suspension and the way the other married priest also accepted his suspension. There is no need to whip up sentiments and play on the emotions of people. When an institution you are under stops no longer agrees with your personal convictions, instead of sticking on and having identity crises, it's better to withdraw and actualize your full potential. Both Rev. Prof. Martins Paul Obayi and Most. Rev. Prof. Igwebuike Godfrey Onah are great sons of Nsukka who have brought good things to the diocese and the community. It's important that they continue to do their good works for the zone and not be hindered by Dogma. If the Okunerere Adoration Ministry work is more important for Fr. Paul than his priestly calling, he should tow the way of Fr. Hyacinth Iormem Alia, who believes that rescuing Benue State is more important than his priestly calling at least for the next 8 years. He should step down and focus on the Adoration so he can be free from the Church the way (truncated)",,136,"{'like_count': 75, 'comment_count': 35, 'num_users': 69041}",Nigerian  Catholics,,2023-10-14 09:42:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/336718105_252043260589337_96681924242050348_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LOWjtD5cL68AX8knC2c&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAMrap2_yjDIDkNF6-LUlrx9Lf_tw8V84TxlC-QZl_k4A&oe=655AE5E4,https://www.facebook.com/100064492458586/posts/709053607921048,

facebook,"🇵🇸🇵🇸 The Palestine Support Society is organising a public protest today (Oct. 14) at 3.30 pm in Al Sayah in 🇧🇭🇧🇭Busaiteen. This stand comes in response to the call of the Holy Qur'an, said the society. ""As we watch and follow the crimes of the Zionist occupation in Gaza, which was targeted with its internationally prohibited missiles and weapons; defenceless civilians, including women, children, and the elderly; and their residential areas, homes, hospitals, schools, and markets, which have claimed hundreds of martyrs up to this moment in violation of all international norms, charters, and laws, as well as human conscience and morals, which were violated with hypocritical and double-standard American Western support,"" stated the Palestine Support Society. ""This stand is nothing but an expression of the state of Bahraini popular anger that rejects these crimes and rejects any normalisation or rapprochement with an occupying, usurping entity that does not respect human rights and has no covenants, charters, or human morals."" The Palestine Support Society calls on Bahraini citizens, residents, institutions, and associations to participate in the stand and to make their voices heard to everyone by supporting the Palestinian people in their defence of the nation’s sanctities.

This stand comes in response to the call of the Holy Qur'an, said the society. ""As we watch and follow the crimes of the Zionist occupation in Gaza, which was targeted with its internationally prohibited missiles and weapons; defenceless civilians, including women, children, and the elderly; and their residential areas, homes, hospitals, schools, and markets, which have claimed hundreds of martyrs up to this moment in violation of all international norms, charters, and laws, as well as human conscience and morals, which were violated with hypocritical and double-standard American Western support,"" stated the Palestine Support Society. ""This stand is nothing but an expression of the state of Bahraini popular anger that rejects these crimes and rejects any normalisation or rapprochement with an occupying, usurping entity that does not respect human rights and has no covenants, charters, or human morals."" The Palestine Support Society calls on Bahraini citizens, residents, institutions, and associations to participate in the stand and to make their voices heard to everyone by supporting the Palestinian people in their defence of the nation’s sanctities.

facebook,"For the past week, news from Israel and Gaza has been distressing. When news events like conflict, natural disasters, pandemics and other tragedies reach our screens, it can cause a lot of anxiety and even a sense of hopelessness. For people living with dementia, the constant stream of images on the news may cause additional worry and feel overwhelming – perhaps because it brings back personal memories of their own distressing experiences, such as living through previous times of conflict or tragedy. We can’t make the news go away, but we do have some tips for dealing with it. The 24-hour news cycle can make it difficult to switch off, so try to limit how much you read, watch or listen to. Take care of your mental health. If you or someone you support is struggling with stress or anxiety that is affecting your ability to function properly, or you are feeling very low, then contact your GP for help. Or call our Dementia support line if you are lonely or afraid and need a chat. Understand a person may be 'time-shifting; and their experience may be that they are living at an earlier time in their life. They may become disorientated and confused about time and place.

facebook,"ICAHD Statement on Hamas incursion and
Israel's disproportionate retaliation
 

ICAHD (Israeli Coalition Against Home Demolition) mourns the loss of all lives, Israeli and Palestinian, whether in the Hamas incursion or in the course of Israel’s disproportionate retaliation. All lives are precious, period. Precisely for that reason, however, we need to emphasize the political context if we hope to ever achieve a substantially just resolution and prevent further deaths and suffering.

The context is clear. The Palestinians have never been at war with Jews; they have been resisting a unilateral settler colonial project whose declared aim is the take-over of their homeland, the transformation of Palestine into Israel and the erasure of the Palestinian people, its culture and heritage. Calls to “end the violence” are not enough. On the contrary, they create a false dichotomy between military conquest, occupation, displacement, repression and the war crimes of a settler state on the one hand and the resistance of a colonized people with no state of their own, no army and no support from the major political powers on the other. Under the guise of “security” and “self-defense,” the United States and Europe have supported Israel’s killing and displacement of Palestinians – routinely described as “terrorists” – while ignoring and even justifying Israeli state terrorism.

The only way to end the violence and save all lives in Palestine/Israel is to decolonize the oppressive apartheid regime and its occupation, replacing them with a democratic state offering equal rights for all. We realize that in the midst of the ongoing events there exists no space for talk of a just political settlement and “peace.” But Israel can neither complete its settler project nor erase the Palestinian people, and no Palestinians should be killed or displaced in its futile attempt to do so. Nor can Palestinians achieve their liberation from an infinitely stronger Israel through armed struggle.

We call on Israel to stop its genocidal revenge attacks on Gaza, and certainly not to mount a ground invasion. We call on progressive forces everywhere to change the narrative. No longer should we speak of a “conflict” in which Palestinian resistance is criminalized and Israel’s expansion through military means is cast as its “right of self-defense.” Only a shift to an anti-colonial narrative will enable the emergence of a just, peaceful and secure post-colonial state and shared society out of the pools of blood in which we wallow.",,120,"{'like_count': 62, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 34483}",Anarcho-Judaism,,2023-10-14 13:26:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/348237581_551696960461316_5392944696775280105_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=STzKwxxmQ2MAX-Yo9oL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAdehKjXY60Q8b7jGZtkrYnMV_gE0fZtRdEtMcUhDBgEA&oe=655B0BA1,https://www.facebook.com/100081998514429/posts/299953889414559,

Callistus was on more than one occasion accused of [heresy](https://catholicsaints.info/pope-saint-callistus-i/heresy) for such actions as permitting a return to [Communion](https://catholicsaints.info/pope-saint-callistus-i/holy-communion) for sinners who had repented and done penance, or for proclaiming that differences in economic class were no barrier to [marriage](https://catholicsaints.info/pope-saint-callistus-i/matrimony). This last put him in conflict with Roman civil law, but he stated that in matters concerning the [Church](https://catholicsaints.info/pope-saint-callistus-i/catholic-church) and the [sacraments](https://catholicsaints.info/pope-saint-callistus-i/sacrament), [Church](https://catholicsaints.info/pope-saint-callistus-i/catholic-church)[law](https://catholicsaints.info/pope-saint-callistus-i/patrons-of-canonists) trumped civil [law](https://catholicsaints.info/pope-saint-callistus-i/patrons-of-lawyers).

facebook,"You see, our minds are fragmented, broken up - the business mind, the religious mind, the family mind, the corrupt mind, the ideological mind, the religious mind, and so on - it is broken up. And thought is responsible for this breaking up. And thought assumes a certain responsibility and says, 'I am different from the thing which I observe'. That is, I am not envy, because I can control envy, I can shape envy, I can run away from envy, but it cannot change envy because it is a fragment of itself. Envy is a fragment of the observer who says, 'I am different from envy'. So, when the observer is the observed then there is no conflict, which means no duality at all, and therefore there is instant action without friction.

Now, if you have listened to this with your heart and with your mind, with care and attention, which means with affection, then you are learning a great deal. Not from the speaker; the speaker cannot teach you. You are both the teacher and the disciple. And if you have heard what was said it's yours. If you have not heard then it is another's, and when you repeat another, something which others have said, you are utterly second-hand human beings. So don't repeat anything that you yourself have not known directly by your understanding of yourself. That's the first thing to learn: don't repeat a thing, either from the Gita - never! Only that which you know, which you have understood by examining yourself. Then you will find out the extraordinary subtleties, the beauty, the immensity of that. It's like looking at an expanding flower. When you know how to look at a flower with eyes that are full of care and love and affection, that flower begins to unfold, show its greatness, its beauty, its perfume. In the same way, when you know, when you can look at yourself, it reveals tremendous things, and therein lies the beauty of living.

Ieri după-amiază, concertul lui Mircea Baniciu se anunța unul normal - ca de obicei ""sold out""- și Tetea dimpreună noi, cei câțiva prieteni locali cu care-i place să stea la povesti, ne beam berea la Vaporu', râzând de poznele povestite cu vervă de protagonist. 
La un moment dat, cineva de la masă ne anunță că Nicu Covaci e în oraș si că e posibil să apară si el la concert, fiindca si Titi Dragomir vrusese să rezerve o masă, dar nu mai erau locuri ... 
-Să vină  - zice Tetea -  poa' să stea si cu noi, dacă vrea. 
Eu am ridicat sceptic o sprânceană, mai ales că știind temperamentul vulcanic al lui Nicu, nu-mi puteam imagina nici pe departe o întâlnire foarte amicală. 
-----------------------------------------

Seara, masa artiștilor era animată, apar Tavi Iepan, Hanno Hoefer, Mircea ""Blues"" Chinezoni, Sergiu Simionese .... ce mai, lume bună si veselă, iar concertul lui Mircea abia începuse ...
La un moment dat, cineva de la masa noastră zice răspicat ""Vine balaurul!""
Într-adevăr, Nicu Covaci își face apariția  salutând lumea, lume cam perplexa, stiut find faptul ca Nicu e de ani buni in conflict cu ceilalți componenți ai formulei de aur a trupei Phoenix.
Repede, i se face loc  la masă si se nimerește să stea chiar în fata mea, dar cu spatele la scenă. Eu deja mă pregătisem psihic să îmi aud de toate din partea lui, fiindcă am fost unul dintre cei care l-au criticat public în perioada conflictului deschis cu restul trupei. 
N-a fost să fie așa ... Nici nu m-a salutat sau băgat în seamă. Bun si așa - gândesc eu - chiar poate e si mai bine! Nu trece un minut si Nicu zice cu o voce guturală: 
- Unde naiba m-ați pus, că nu văd nimic!
Dodo, ce stătea în dreapta mea - îi spune instantaneu lui Nicu:
- Hai, stai în locul meu, că de aici se vede perfect!
Nicu se ridică si trece în locul lui Dodo.
Noa, acuma-i acum! gândesc eu. Nicu .... nici o reacție în dreapta mea - ignor total! Tavi Iepan mustăcea în stânga mea. 
- Bă, ăsta mă ignoră sau nu mă recunoaște? îl întreb eu pe Tavi.
- Poate ambele ... zice el zâmbind. 
Măi să fie! - gândesc eu - nu se poate să stăm așa si mă întorc către Nicu, îi întind mâna si-i spun:
- Eu sunt Corneliu Vaida ... dacă nu m-ai recunoscut.  
Mâna lui Nicu, care ducea paharul la gură se oprește, apoi pleacă înapoi spre masă, lasă paharul, întoarce capul spre mine cu o privire de oțel si îmi strânge mâna în menghina palmei sale.
- Aha .... noi doi avem de discutat! Ce faci mâine după masa?
- Discutam oricând, mă suni când ești liber si ne întâlnim. 
Facem schimb de numere de telefon.
-------------------------------------
-Nicule, ce fain ar fi dacă ați cânta o melodie împreună ... tu si Mircea .... - spune Maria, privindu-l pe Nicu în ochi.
- Ce? Nu ... niciodată! vine replica fermă a lui Nicu.
- Ei ... niciodată .... Eu cred ca voi, ăștia din formula de aur, ar mai trebui să faceți un concert ... doar voi! Pentru mine - si cei ca mine - Phoenix sunteti voi! zic eu.
- Bă! Eu am vrut, dar ei au avut pretenții prea mari! a tunat Nicu.
Cei de la masă, auzind discuția, au plusat:
- Hai, măi Nicu! Uite-te la oameni .... Tu-ți dai seama că lumea te-a vazut si se așteaptă să cânți, măcar o piesă?
- Da, Nicu cântă ... dar scoate vesta! a spus în germana Yvonne, iubita lui Nicu.
- Bine ... bine .... si Nicu s-a ridicat, îndreptând-se agale spre scenă, urmărit de priviri care curioase, care uimite, care admirative!
Eu după el, fiindca așa un moment trebuie imortalizat!
Ovații .... aplauze .... fluierături admirative ...
Nicu se scuză pentru că vocea nu mai e deloc cea care a fost, dar cui îi pasă? Mircea îi pune chitara sa, si Nicu - vădit emoționat - cântă ""În umbra marelui urs"".
Filmez si lăcrimez .... Mă uit în jur si constat că nu doar eu lăcrimam ... lăcrima si publicul ... lacrima si Baniciu ...

Păi, si rockerii lăcrimează, nu-i așa?

instagram,"""It’s been a dreadful week. Humanity must prevail.

Civilians in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory are suffering from a week of utter anguish and devastation. I fear that the worst is yet to come. 

In Israel, families are reeling from the horror of last Saturday’s attack. More than a thousand people have been killed and many more have been injured. Over 100 people are held captive. 

In Gaza, families have been bombed while inching their way south along congested, damaged roads, following an evacuation order that left hundreds of thousands of people scrambling for safety but with nowhere to go.
 
Nearly 2,000 people have been killed and many more have been injured. 

There is no power, no water and no fuel. Food supplies are running dangerously low.

Hospitals, overwhelmed with patients, are running out of medicine. 

Morgues are overflowing. 

Homes, schools, shelters, health centers and places of worship are under intense bombardment. 

Entire residential neighbourhoods have been razed to the ground. 
Aid workers have been killed.

The humanitarian situation in Gaza, already critical, is fast becoming untenable.

In the West Bank, violence is on the rise, with a surge in civilian deaths and injuries. Families are facing ever greater movement restrictions.

And in Lebanon, the risk of the conflict spilling into the country is a major concern. 

The parties’ actions and rhetoric over the past few days are extremely alarming and unacceptable.

Even wars have rules, and these rules must be upheld, at all times, and by all sides.

Civilians and civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian workers and assets, must be protected. 

Civilians must be allowed to leave for safer areas. And whether they move or stay, constant care must be taken to spare them.

Essential supplies and services and unimpeded humanitarian access must be allowed.

Anyone held captive must be treated humanely. All hostages must be released. 

All countries with influence must exert it to ensure respect for the rules of war and to avoid any further escalation and spillover. 

The past week has been a test for humanity, and humanity is failing.""

instagram,"Democrat New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman @repbowman has called on the United States to “welcome” Palestinian refugees as experts predict that one million people fleeing the Gaza Strip will need new homes. 

“Fifty percent of the population in Gaza are children,” the congressman told the New York Post on Saturday. “The international community as well as the United States should be prepared to welcome refugees from Palestine while being very careful to vet and not allow members of Hamas.”

His call for the United States to take in Palestinians came after Israel gave residents of northern Gaza a 24-hour warning to evacuate to the southern portion of the strip. Over 400,000 Gazans have fled their homes as of Saturday morning, the Times of Israel reported.

Egypt has closed its border with Gaza and is unwilling to receive Palestinian refugees. In response to devastating attacks from the Islamist terror group Hamas which killed 1,300 Israelis last Saturday, Israel has launched a deadly response into Gaza. Despite being given the warning, many civilians who were unable or unwilling to leave their homes perished in the shellings from Israel.

“According to the latest reports by local health authorities and media, at least 2,215 Palestinians were reportedly killed, including over 700 children, and more than 8,714 people wounded, including more than 2,450 children,” UNICEF spokeswoman Sara Al Hattab told CNN.

In a statement to the New York Post, the founder of the World Identity Network Foundation, Mariana Dahan, estimated the conflict “may add over one million people to the already staggering number of 6 million Palestinian refugees in the world.”",,20000,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 10000, 'num_users': 1763408}",Breitbart,,2023-10-14 18:15:49,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/13551627_1574264712878053_190076427_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JAAg8UNZ8AcAX-mMSa1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAI5_EdvpV5S_fAju6ibG4mVySFTWyYvNAj1uv665mTLg&oe=655B2285,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyY5Fwmpz-o/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391366370_201472976303634_2360296007081357151_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=22ubCCPrQhAAX_5x3X_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAU3ohE6M2-c-piC4rY-S4uIF7uaqgJLoU6mpS_ffvytQ&oe=6532FD7C

The Iranian Foreign Minister said today in a briefing for reporters in Beirut after his meeting with Ĥ*zɓ*ll*h Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah that Israel must stop its war crimes immediately because it may be too late in a few hours.

instagram,"Toni Morrison was one of 18 writers who co-wrote and signed a letter as a call to resist Israel's undeclared political aim: the liquidation of the Palestinian state.

The letter was published on 
August 18, 2006 in The Nation.

The letter reads:

“The latest chapter of the conflict between Israel and Palestine began when Israeli forces abducted two civilians, a doctor and his brother, from Gaza. An incident scarcely reported anywhere, except in the Turkish press. The following day the Palestinians took an Israeli soldier prisoner–and proposed a negotiated exchange against prisoners taken by the Israelis–there are approximately 10,000 in Israeli jails.”

“That this “kidnapping” was considered an outrage, whereas the illegal military occupation of the West Bank and the systematic appropriation of its natural resources–most particularly that of water–by the Israeli Defense (!) Forces is considered a regrettable but realistic fact of life, is typical of the double standards repeatedly employed by the West in face of what has befallen the Palestinians, on the land allotted to them by international agreements, during the last seventy years.”

“Today outrage follows outrage; makeshift missiles cross sophisticated ones. The latter usually find their target situated where the disinherited and crowded poor live, waiting for what was once called Justice. Both categories of missile rip bodies apart horribly–who but field commanders can forget this for a moment?”

“Each provocation and counter-provocation is contested and preached over. But the subsequent arguments, accusations and vows, all serve as a distraction in order to divert world attention from a long-term military, economic and geographic practice whose political aim is nothing less than the liquidation of the Palestinian nation.”

“This has to be said loud and clear, for the practice, only half declared and often covert, is advancing fast these days, and, in our opinion, it must be unceasingly and eternally recognized for what it is and resisted.”

PS: As Juliano Mer Khamis, director of the documentary film Arna’s Children, asked: “Who is going to paint the ‘Guernica’ of Lebanon?”

When it grows dark, the bombing in Gaza intensifies. Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.

Okal’s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday’s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.

“This is probably the most traumatic experience of my life,” he said. He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. “I’ve never seen things on this scale,” Okal said.

instagram,"Thousands of protesters poured onto the streets of central London on Saturday to demand that Israel halt its bombing campaign and siege of the Gaza Strip as it prepares for a possible ground invasion of the tiny Palestinian enclave.

Undeterred by warnings against waving the Palestinian flag, the protesters gathered outside the BBC’s New Broadcasting House to denounce what they called “Israeli agression”, as air strikes pounded the Gaza Strip for an eighth successive day.

Earlier on Saturday, the exterior of BBC studios in London was sprayed with red paint in protest against the channel’s coverage of the conflict. Middle East Eye contacted the BBC for comment but did not receive a response by time of publication.

At the rally - organised by Friends of Al-Aqsa, Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) and other groups - pro-Palestinian protesters could be heard chanting “Israel is a terrorist state” and “free Palestine” as they moved from Regent Street, one of London’s main shopping thoroughfares, towards Westminster.

More than 1,000 police were deployed ahead of the protest, with the Metropolitan police warning that anyone showing support for Hamas, a group proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK, or deviating from the protest route could face arrest.",,10346,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 346, 'num_users': 1157344}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-14 16:03:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15258686_1293569957329919_8094586152507408384_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CJDb2hU5us0AX_v4NHq&_nc_oc=AQmhTNx9JSMKJ7ByPW-gAGlyTUGiK1GB9OxZLYVv7ZLpS0ddjuukWkjI1QowiM0WwAw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDM7VWUIVa31bFMO0RjUyWcPwhVRpDGdNt6sYzg3bsFBw&oe=655A8754,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyYp8Vuo8kC/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390954467_618349943709834_4491210236687881250_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qVMw-C99OfUAX8V3VzD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD05djopZFtnymAka3GoZj-k-FtZnjaZdYIKBPhIvjKyQ&oe=65318FB9

I don't care on which side you are on the Israeli-Palestine conflict currently happening.
If you support Terrorists and the actions of HAMAS, you are welcome to unfollow me.
I do not want any Terrorists Supporters on my page.
Last Saturday more than 1000 Terrorists were breached in Israel, Slaughtered more than 1300 Innocent civilians, and over a dozen injured.
These animals are called HAMAS massacred entire families, raped women, decapitated babies, and burned their bodies...
even dogs, yes even dogs were not spared.
HAMAS kidnapped over 150 Israelis into Gaza... women, babies, the elderly, and kids.
Even Holocaust survivors!!!!
On top of all, document their actions and spread them to the world and still HAMAS is brain-washing people all round the globe that they are right.🤡
Soon I will be back on my regular posting routine but currently, my country is at war and I stand by my country.
Be prepared for the things I will show in the post as they are brutal and just shocking...

P.S: Part of the innocent people that are murdered aren't even from Israel and some even are HAMAS supporters... so just for you to know......

instagram,"I posted that message at the beginning of the week on my other social media pages and in my stories here. A few days later, this mother contacted me. She wanted to reconnect, thank me for sharing about her, and assure me that she and her son are safe. I was beyond grateful. Later I asked if she’d consider sharing—for the benefit of other parents everywhere—what she had done to help her son through his fears. Here’s what she so generously shared:

“I consulted with Janet a few years ago because of a unique problem. We were under attack by rockets launched at Israel. There were many families affected by this and alarm sirens were blasting many times a day at random hours signaling for us that we had a minute to get to shelter so we didn't get hit.

I hadn’t told my then 4 year old son the truth about what was happening, I made something up and tried to downplay the whole situation as if everything was normal. I didn’t want him to be scared or traumatized so for the days that followed my husband and I refrained from talking about it in front of him and we did our best to dodge his questions or outright lie about it. Looking back I am sure that the message he got from us was that we ourselves were uncertain, confused and couldn’t handle what was going on (we really couldn't but we were trying to act like we were, and he could see right through us). As a result, my son became extremely clingy, highly sensitive and prone to outbursts. He jumped at every sound he heard.
I worked on the following things following my consultations with Janet on the subject:
1. Telling my son the truth in an age-appropriate way. We worked on the actual wording like “this conflict has been going on for a long time” (to give him context), “hearing the alarms and the explosions can be really scary” (since that was what I observed he was feeling), and other things like that. Janet also made the point that I can’t protect him from hearing what he hears from friends and other family members and that it’s of utmost importance he knows we talk about EVERYTHING in our household.

instagram,"""An instructor at Stanford University has been removed from teaching duties as the school investigates reports that during a discussion on the conflict between Israel and Hamas, the instructor downplayed the Holocaust and singled out students “based on their backgrounds and identities.”

“Without prejudging the matter, this report is a cause for serious concern. Academic freedom does not permit the identity-based targeting of students,” Stanford said in a statement Wednesday.

“The instructor in this course is not currently teaching while the university works to ascertain the facts of the situation,” the statement continued...

...Rabbi Dov Greenberg, executive director of Rohr Chabad House, Stanford’s Jewish community center, told CNN the students were “shaken up.”

Greenberg, who said he spoke with the students involved in the incident, said they are “not doing well” and are afraid to face backlash or bullying on campus.

According to Greenberg, the students said the instructor tried to justify the actions of Hamas and asked the students how many Jews were killed in the Holocaust.

After one student answered “6 million,” the instructor then said more people have been killed by colonizers and said, “Israel is a colonizer.”

The instructor then illustrated his point by asking some students to physically go to the back of class. “That’s what Israel does to Palestinians,” the teacher said, according to Greenberg...

...The Stanford instructor’s alleged comments came during two classes Tuesday, with a total of 18 students, during which the instructor announced the day’s lesson would focus on colonialism, the San Francisco Chronicle reported...

...Students [said] the instructor brought up the colonization of Congo by Belgium’s King Leopold II in the 19th century and said more people were killed then than during the Holocaust, and Israel had colonized Palestinians, the Chronicle reported.

Students from both classes told Cohen and Mandelshtam the instructor asked students where their ancestors were from and labeled them as a “colonizer” or “colonized,” according to the Chronicle""

⁠
Israel has warned 1.1 million people living in the north of the enclave to evacuate ahead of an expected ground operation in Gaza with the IDF planning to strike the territory from land, sea and air.⁠
⁠
Iran’s involvement could be through a militant group from Syria or by backing Hezbollah to join the conflict, diplomatic sources told Axios.⁠
⁠
Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said that Israel’s operations could cause fighting to expand to other areas of the Middle East which would cause Israel to suffer “a huge earthquake”, reported the Associated Press.⁠
⁠
Hezbollah has thousands of fighters and an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles capable of hitting anywhere in Israel, according to the outlet.⁠
⁠
“I know about the scenarios that Hezbollah has put in place,” Mr Amirabdollahian said from Beirut on Saturday. “Any step the resistance (Hezbollah) will take will cause a huge earthquake in the Zionist entity.”⁠
⁠
And he added: “I want to warn the war criminals and those who support this entity before it’s too late to stop the crimes against civilians in Gaza, because it might be too late in few hours.”⁠

instagram,"As #Israel continues to pummel the Gaza Strip from the sky, #Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are gripped with tension and have reported an increase of attacks against them by settlers and soldiers alike.⁠
.⁠
Since last Saturday, at least 55 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,100 others wounded.⁠
.⁠
According to human rights activist Samir Abu Shams, the Israeli army is in violation of multiple international laws, particularly the Geneva Conventions, which stress that civilians should be unharmed in situations of war and armed conflict.⁠
.⁠
“What we are seeing today is that the occupation forces enter civilian areas, create friction, and target civilians with gunfire without any justification,” the 60-year-old from Tulkarem said. “Most of the cases of Israeli gunfire have been against Palestinian civilians passing through the street or going to their place of work.”⁠
.⁠
On the one hand, Abu Shams went on to say, the Israeli occupation isolates the Gaza Strip from the West Bank.⁠
.⁠
“On the other, it takes revenge on civilians in the occupied West Bank and takes measures to arm settlers and gives instructions to open fire on men, women, and children,” he said.⁠

instagram,"France has banned not only pro-Hamas protests but any kind of pro-Palestine or anti-Israel demonstrations to ensure the security of Jewish citizens in light of the escalating Israel-Palestine conflict.

“Let us not bring ideological adventures here [to France] by imitation or by projection. Let us not add national fractures […] to international fractures,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement to the French people. 

Despite the ban on protests, thousands of Palestine supporters gathered in Paris, Lille, Bordeaux, and other cities on Thursday.

Police used tear gas and water cannons on pro-Palestinians protestors who ignored the ban as riot police dispersed crowds following orders from French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. “Pro-Palestinian demonstrations must be prohibited because they are likely to generate disturbances to the public order,” Darmanin ordered in a notice sent to the police, adding that arrests will be warranted for all those who organize protests.

Harper’s Bazaar editor-in-chief Samira Nasr has apologized after receiving backlash for an Instagram post about the current conflict in Israel and Palestine. 
__________________________________________________

Nasr’s original post referenced the Israeli government cutting off water and electricity to Palestinians amid the war with the Hamas terrorist groups. The now-deleted post reads, “Cutting off water and electricity to 2.2 civilians….This is the most inhumane thing I’ve seen in my life.” Shortly after posting the Instagram story, Nasr faced backlash from her followers and colleagues at Hearst Publications, as the New York Post reported.
__________________________________________________
Following the backlash, Nasr apologized on Thursday and said, “I want to apologize to my friends, colleagues, and the entire Jewish community for my deeply insensitive and hurtful comments. I have no hate in my heart for any people, and I am not in any way sympathetic to a terrorist group that just murdered thousands of innocent Israeli civilians.” The editor-in-chief continued, “I am a firm believer that words matter, and I was careless with mine. My most sincere apologies.”

instagram,"I flew to Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia for meetings with our partners. It is our collective goal to prevent any state or non-state actors from creating a new front in this conflict. In all of my conversations, our friends and partners throughout the region have agreed that there can be no more business as usual with Hamas. 

We know the humanitarian situation is urgent. Efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza are complicated by the fact that Hamas continues to use innocent civilians as human shields and is reportedly blocking roads to prevent Palestinians from moving to southern Gaza, out of harm’s way. 

Regardless of these challenges, we are actively working with partners, @UN relief agencies, the @ICRC, and others to address the acute humanitarian needs of people in Gaza – to protect civilians from harm and ensure that they have the ability to get what they need. 

Let us not lose sight of why this is happening. 

Israel is conducting operations in Gaza because Hamas—a terrorist organization—attacked, slaughtered, raped, mutilated, tortured, and burned innocent civilians. We continue to discuss with Israel the importance of taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians while exercising its right to defend its people—and to try to ensure that Hamas can never repeat what it’s done. 

For Americans in Israel who wish to depart, our @StateDept team is chartering flights to provide additional options. The first flight carrying U.S. citizens and their immediate family members from Israel is wheels down in Athens. Our work will continue. 

As we finish this day and look to the next, know that we are working intensively to secure the release of hostages, including American citizens held by Hamas in Gaza. 

I carry the discussions I had with the families of the people held hostage by Hamas with me as I fly from country to country. 

Their—and our—anguish is profound and we know they are desperate to be with their loved ones. We are working urgently to bring people home. We are doing that with allies and partners across the region, and I am grateful that the international partners I am meeting with share this collective urgency.",,5417,"{'like_count': 4704, 'comment_count': 713, 'num_users': 186999}",Secretary Antony Blinken,,2023-10-14 00:21:34,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/151969395_466051571080863_3955082175756404230_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=cn9-3khdRGYAX-k6Wc8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC-MBBDw2pTxPSdOe-1IbUzqxpfE373Ne7dx4E5cosUmw&oe=655AF39C,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyW-Jyqu-FK/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391293745_648617067416231_1725973776396305097_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9oE9ZotI-RwAX8uPXbb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDhVyMIt9PbI61TdF376nCrtgLMY8VDRN13G9IWR3kkiQ&oe=655A5FB8

instagram,"On Saturday, central London witnessed a significant gathering of protesters numbering in the thousands. Their unified demand was clear: they called for an immediate cessation of Israel's bombing campaign and the siege on the Gaza Strip, all while expressing concerns about a potential ground invasion of this small Palestinian territory.

Unfazed by warnings against displaying the Palestinian flag, demonstrators assembled outside the BBC's New Broadcasting House to voice their condemnation of what they deemed ""Israeli aggression."" This demonstration unfolded amidst ongoing airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, which had persisted for an eighth consecutive day.

Earlier that same day, BBC studios in London became the target of a protest, with the exterior of the building being splattered with red paint. This act was carried out in protest against the channel's coverage of the conflict. When Middle East Eye sought a response from the BBC, no comment had been received by the time of publication.

This rally, organized by Friends of Al-Aqsa, the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), and other affiliated groups, resonated with pro-Palestinian voices.

instagram,"In the wake of the recent surge in tensions between Palestinian militant groups and Israel, acclaimed Israeli-Kenyan musician, Gilad Millo, took to social media to share a message reflecting the impact of the conflict on his family. 

In an Instagram video, Gilad conveyed a personal account of the situation, detailing how his son, Omer, had made the courageous decision to return to Israel and join his paratrooper unit as an IDF reservist.

""Our son Omer landed in Israel to join his paratrooper unit as a reservist in @idf,"" Gilad shared in his touching message.

Despite the challenges posed by flight cancellations and the escalating crisis, Omer found a way to make his way back to his homeland to serve alongside his sister, Lia, who is also a soldier in the IDF. Lia had been actively involved in training combat medical teams in preparation for the ongoing conflict.

The decision made by Omer and Lia to serve in the Israeli army stemmed from a deep sense of duty and responsibility. Having grown up in Kenya, the siblings have been deeply affected by the tragic events that have unfolded, having lost friends and acquaintances in the devastating attacks.

Gilad and his wife expressed their profound pride and admiration for their children, acknowledging their remarkable strength and character.

instagram,"Saudi Arabia is putting U.S.-backed plans to normalise ties with Israel on ice, two sources familiar with Riyadh's thinking said, signalling a rapid rethinking of its foreign policy priorities as war escalates between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas.⁠
⁠
The conflict has also pushed the kingdom to engage with Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took his first phone call from Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi as Riyadh tries to prevent a broader surge in violence across the region.⁠
⁠
The two sources told Reuters there would be a delay in the U.S.-backed talks on normalisation with Israel that was a key step for the kingdom to secure what Riyadh considers the real prize of a U.S. defence pact in exchange.⁠
⁠
Until Iran-backed Hamas sparked a war on Oct. 7 by launching a devastating attack on Israel, both Israeli and Saudi leaders had been saying they were moving steadily towards a deal that could have reshaped the Middle East.⁠
⁠
Saudi Arabia, birthplace of Islam and home to its two holiest sites, had until the latest conflict indicated it would not allow its pursuit of a U.S. defence pact be derailed even if Israel did not offer significant concessions to the Palestinians in the their bid for statehood, sources had previously said.⁠
⁠
But an approach that sidelined Palestinians would risk angering Arabs around the region, as Arab news outlets broadcast images of Palestinians killed in Israeli retaliatory airstrikes.⁠

instagram,"The first 'Nakba' (catastrophe) happened in 1948, it refers to the mass displacement & dispossession of Palestinians. Before the Nakba, Palestine was a multi-ethnic and multi cultural society. There was a permanent displacement of more than half of the Palestinian population - for the Zionist movement to establish a Jewish state. 
Zionist and Jews are not the same, there are many Jewish people around the world who stand with Palestine. I want to make that clear, anti-semitism is mentioned a lot here - but what about Islamaphobia? Those who stand with Gaza do NOT stand for terrorism, they stand with freedom for the Palestinian citizens to be treated as humans. Despite pleas from the United Nations and human rights groups, Israel has maintained a land, air and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip. It is also under military occupation by Israel. 
The conditions in Gaza is those of 'an open air prison' there is restriction of movement Israel enforces on Palestinians there. Israel prohibits Palestinians from entering or leaving the area. Israelis, Jewish settlers and foreigners are not subject to those restrictions and are free to travel in and out of the Gaza Strip.
Israel's 16-year blockade has driven the Gaza Strip's economy to near-collapse, More than 65% of the population lives under the poverty line, according to the UN, with 63% of people deemed ""food insecure"" by the World Food Programme. I believe these numbers to be higher. 
This isn't 'conflict' - it is ethnic cleansing for the Palestinian people. What's crazy to me is that the torture of Palestinians has truly been going on for YEARS there are plenty of videos and pictures but unfortunately no media coverage. No media coverage of the horrific acts Israel carries out, they control the media that's why. Don't blindly watch the news. The videos and pictures are so triggering (in Palestine) also many celebrities have gone to post them as conditions in Israel, and then removed (with no support or words) for our people in Palestine. 
If it wasn't for social media power the little coverage that we do have wouldn't even happen.

instagram,"""In dealing with conflict, we should first contemplate that our adversary wants to be happy and be free from suffering, just as we do. 

Next, try to see things from their point of view. By looking at the situation from their perspective, we’ll be able to see clearly who has the mistaken idea, and who is in error. We will be able to see our own faults clearly, too. If, through this contemplation, we find that we are the ones in error, then we can begin to address those faults in ourselves. Should we confirm that yes, the other person is the one who is confused and at fault, we’ll still be able to see the situation with compassion. 

We’ll recognize that they are trying for happiness, but they misunderstand how to attain it. They might be harming us, and others too, yet we can understand that their behavior is actually impeding the happiness that they’re trying to achieve."" -Mingyur Rinpoche

instagram,"“First Memories” 10.09.2023, North Carolina

•••••

The tiny apartment on the right is where I lived with my parents & brother from 1973 to 1975. I was 4 years old when I left there- this is where my first memories are from. Until the other day, I hadn’t seen it in 42 years, but everything looked exactly as I remembered. We had very little money & it was quite small, but it was more than enough. My first memories are good ones, a happy time with our little family— I am grateful for that. When I looked to the sky, I only saw a beautiful blue. 

Bombs did not fall from the warplanes of a neighboring state to level my neighborhood, nor did armed men descend on paragliders to execute my family. 

Once again, I am grateful. 

But these horrors will be the first clear memories many children will have for the rest of their lives. We call them Jewish & Muslim, Palestinian & Israeli... do you think at 2, 3, or 4 years old, those kids have any conception of what those terms mean? But in the midst of this living hell, their nascent awareness of the world is being born. This will stay with them forever, shaping their identity- their childhood is a killing field, & they will grow up soaked in bloody memories. 

What kind of adults will be formed by this?

We ignore history & human nature at our own peril.

I am not an expert on Middle Eastern affairs (or anything else), but I do know this: this is not a sports match on tv. Remember that. Global geopolitical stability is already very fragile, & without rapid deescalation, conflict could expand swiftly to engulf the entire region, then spread outwards to encompass the entire planet. The dominos are stacked up & ready to fall- it’s happened before, & make no mistake, it can happen again.

Marinate on that for a second.

Whatever your beliefs- any sane, pragmatic person should be calling for an immediate ceasefire, release of Israeli hostages, & humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza. This will not stop otherwise. It’s been a week of CONSTANT DEATH- haven’t enough children died? 

The current trajectory is not viable for anything other than our potential annihilation. 

We must not lose sight of this. 

ENOUGH.

instagram,"Violence begets violence. This hatred is handed down through generations, with children conditioned to loathe and fear the ""other."" I have experienced this first hand; both of my parents are refugees of war, my mother's brother is considered a 'hero' as he died for his country. 

To genuinely address wars, we must first eradicate all conflict from our own lives, both internal and external. 

And for that to happen you must be nobody, belong nowhere hence belong everywhere. Only then you are a whole human being. Only then you shall know peace and love.  Not the love for your family or your country, but love.

The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) has urged Nigerians to support the “oppre§§ed” Palestinians against Israel's br¥tal att#ck on the civilians especially women and children over the years.

Members of the movement also protested on Friday against the ongoing att#ck on

instagram,"⚡In a bizarre statement, the controversial head priest of Ghaziabad’s Dasna Devi temple,Yati Narsinghanand, requested that the Prime Minister of Israel let him and his thousand disciples join the fight against Hamas.

The statement was made in a viral video where Yati Narsinghanand can be seen putting out his quirky ideas along with five of his supporters.

In the video, Yati says that he and his supporters will contribute to the Israel-Hamas war free of charge. He also aims to approach the Israeli embassy in Delhi on October 16 in order to submit the request letter.

“Israel and our enemy are the same”, he added.

Responding to the weird statements made by the priest, the internet was pondering in doses of sarcasm, with one user stating that the viral video was “better than the Kapil Sharma show”.

Further, India has officially declared its support for Israel. On the other hand, Indians on the internet can be seen divided on the ongoing conflict, with many supporting Israel while others showing solidarity with Palestine.

instagram,"Islamic group, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has criticised the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, for taking sides in the ongoing war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.⁣
.⁣
Hamas launched a surprising attack on Israeli soil in the early hours of Saturday, October 7, 2023, killing over 1,300 people and taking at least 120 others hostage.⁣
.⁣
In a retaliatory move, Israel launched a continuous bombardment on Gaza, a densely populated Palestinian territory controlled by Hamas, with thousands of airstrikes.⁣
.⁣
As at the last count, the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip has accounted for the death of over 2,000 civilians and the destruction of over 1,000 residential buildings.⁣
.⁣
During the week, Adeboye appeared in a video posted on his X account, where he prayed to God to grant Israel ‘absolute victory’ in the ongoing conflict.⁣
.⁣
The cleric noted that his prayers are with the people of Israel and that they have the support of the RCCG members worldwide.⁣

It’s hard to know what to believe — or what’s behind some of the big developments you’re reading about.

In the latest newsletter we get into the call for 1 million Palestinians  to evacuate quickly. Why Hamas is telling them not to go - even blocking some roads. How this goes to the very roots of this conflict. Why Egypt is central to the decisions that come next. 

We also explain a bit about the  city of tunnels under Gaza. And fears that Israeli soldiers are walking into a trap.

We focused on this because we think it will help you make sense of the news that will unfold in the coming days. Let me know your questions.

instagram,"Just as AI has its own biases (this image was generated with Midjourney, an AI generator), humans too have their inherent biases. The true essence of humanity lies in overcoming these biases through empathy. While it's natural to have biases, without empathy, these biases can escalate into extreme cruelty.

This isn't a message to influence or persuade. It's merely a personal reflection on the influential powers that dominate our world. The entities that champion liberty and freedom often falter in their representation of events, as I've witnessed this in Egypt before, where the repercussions of media misrepresentation still reverberate.The potential for media to twist reality and thereby influence life-altering events is something many may not fully grasp. I've personally realized the extent of media bias this year. The idea that influential media outlets can be swayed by xenophobia, political agendas, and other biases is deeply troubling. When these outlets propagate messages of hate, choose sides rather than standing with humanity, or dehumanize anyone who doesn't align with their narrative, it's concerning.

While human conflict has been a constant throughout history, the amplification of these conflicts by biased media narratives has repeatedly threatened the fabric of our civilizations.

I don't ask you to align with any specific side, but to value innocent human lives above all. Take a moment to step out of your digital bubble and its media narratives. Conduct your own research, understand the other side.

instagram,"“Where can I turn for peace?
Where is my solace
When other sources cease to make me whole?
When with a wounded heart, anger, or malice,
I draw myself apart,
Searching my soul?”

“Where, when my aching grows,
Where, when I languish,
Where, in my need to know, where can I run?”

This song brought me solace as a kid & certainly fed into my belief that running was the solution to most of my challenges. And it worked / has worked in most cases.

The sad part, however, is that those who are currently suffering have nowhere to run.

We all deserve peace. We all deserve a place of refuge. We all deserve time & space to live & work & worship & recreate, but that isn’t the reality for millions of innocent victims of this age old conflict.

I don’t claim to have the answers & I recognize the irony of sharing the words of a religious hymn when it is religion that is being used to justify the mobilization, militarization & brutalization of the masses.

I am also keenly aware that I am descended from colonizers. I am not native to this land or these places to which I run & in which I find refuge.

I do know that nationalism, militarism, racism & colonialism / imperialism are not the answer, but rather the cause of the current condition & as long as they continue to be supported financially & with our silence, the conflict, instability & brutality will grow worse. That makes me sad because I don’t see either side willing to see the other as human despite historically (according to sacred texts from all three religions) being descended from the same person.

For what it’s worth, here are a few photos of where I run most days in my efforts to find peace within myself & others. My hope is that we each have the opportunity to do the same in our own lives & we do everything in our power to enable & encourage others to do the same.",,2859,"{'like_count': 2805, 'comment_count': 54, 'num_users': 99191}",Jacob Puzey,,2023-10-14 21:36:37,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/314086894_793811901850866_2643303060206146802_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ahBAQu8KnNkAX9-deOH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCWYCkw-2CzgXaCZ86oDJYvOjtxAYD5c2gUGwHxIOckzw&oe=655A23B1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZQEkaygGo/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391255663_1057726762052016_46003443471587342_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=3NMAR9hk6QYAX9TU8JL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDa1ohcUf2CSdS3dAzCcap-NTZdbCMQ46tU8BVnztQEvw&oe=655AE46B

Around a hundred people turned up waving Palestinian flags and signs in solidarity with Palestinians amid the brutal conflict with Israel that erupted last week.

“End genocide! End genocide!” they shouted.

“We can’t do anything from here. Every time I open Facebook, there’s someone I know who is killed, or a friend posting about losing a loved one,” a woman from the Arabic Culture Information Society who organised the protest cried. 

“Would you, Maltese accept to be told to leave your country?” 

The ACIS said that the demonstration was organised “to protest the indiscriminate bombardment and unlawful siege of civilians in the Gaza Strip” which became an open-air prison with 2.2 million inhabitants.

Yesterday, Israel warned 1.1 million Gaza residents to evacuate within 24 hours. The move has been decried by the UN as “impossible”.

DP Gachagua who spoke on Friday when addressing the United Democratic Alliance National Women Congress at Bomas of Kenya reaffirmed his strong ties with the president, reiterating that their friendship of over 20 years goes beyond the political and leadership space.

He termed the presumed tiff an ‘imaginary creation’ by critics who are yet to accept that he and President Ruto won the elections.

""The Government under the able leadership of President William Ruto is united, solid, and stable. There can never be division or conflict. That is a creation of people who are still living in denial,"" the DP affirmed. 

“We have been friends for over 20 years and our friendship surpasses the presidency.”

Gachagua further scoffed at critics saying that the relationship between him and the president had been solidified by the campaign agenda of the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda under UDA, adding that no one should expect any division.

The DP went on to opine that those creating the rift were only envious of the UDA leadership after seeing the country was heading in the right direction.

instagram,"Amid a heavy retaliatory air and artillery assault by Israel against the Gaza Strip on October 10, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted a message on Facebook to residents of the al-Daraj neighborhood, urging them to leave their homes in advance of impending airstrikes.⁠
⁠
It’s not clear how most people in al-Daraj were supposed to see the warning: Intense fighting and electrical shortages have strangled Palestinian access to the internet, putting besieged civilians at even greater risk.⁠
⁠
Following Hamas’s grisly surprise attack across the Gaza border on October 7, the Israeli counterattack left the two million Palestinians who call the area home struggling to connect to the internet at a time when access to current information is crucial and potentially lifesaving.⁠
⁠
“Shutting down the internet in armed conflict is putting civilians at risk,” Deborah Brown, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, told The Intercept. “It could help contribute to injury or death because people communicate around what are safe places and conditions.”⁠
⁠
According to companies and research organizations that monitor the global flow of internet traffic, Gazan access to the internet has dramatically dropped since Israeli strikes began, with data service cut entirely for some customers.⁠
⁠
“My sense is that very few people in Gaza have internet service,” Doug Madory of the internet monitoring firm Kentik told The Intercept. Madory said he spoke to a contact working with an internet service provider in Gaza who told him that internet access has been reduced by 80 to 90 percent because of a lack of fuel and power, and airstrikes.⁠
⁠
As for causes of the outages, Marwa Fatafta, a policy analyst with the digital rights group Access Now, cited Israeli strikes against office buildings housing Gazan telecommunications firms, such as the now-demolished Al-Watan Tower, as a major factor, in addition to damage to the electrical grid.⁠
⁠
Fatafta told The Intercept, “There is a near complete information blackout from Gaza.”⁠

⁣
Cheetahs are generally solitary cats, except when females are raising cubs or males join forces to form hunting coalitions. This trio of youngsters are yet to disperse in search of territory of their own, and when they do, they will face a litany of threats, not least of which will come from human-wildlife conflict. The cheetah is leading the race when it comes to being Africa's most endangered big cat. Eradicated from over 90% of its historic range, the cheetah's wide-ranging nature and vulnerability to competition from rival predators intensify the risks it faces. If we are to give the cheetah a fighting chance at survival, we must protect crucial habitats and address the root causes of human-wildlife conflict.⁣

Australia will provide $3 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to fund urgent needs like restoring essential services and providing medical support to victims of the conflict.

Through United Nations agencies, Australia will provide $7 million to deliver critical support including emergency water, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene services, as well as child protection.

Australia will continue to monitor and assess the humanitarian situation and stands ready to provide further support.

Quote attributable to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Penny Wong:

“We have seen devastating loss of innocent life since the heinous attacks on Israel by brutal terrorist group Hamas.

“Far from representing the Palestinian people, Hamas undermines Palestinian needs and aspirations.

“We continue to call for the unconditional release of all hostages. We stand with Israel and reiterate its right to defend itself.

“We call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

“We call for the establishment of a corridor to enable humanitarian needs to be met. And we support the work of the United States, Egypt and others towards this goal.

“Adherence to international humanitarian law must be prioritised - including the protection of civilians, wherever they live.”

Quote attributable to Minister for International Development and the Pacific, the Hon Pat Conroy MP:

“Australia’s contribution through our trusted partners supports the humanitarian crisis affecting civilians caught up in this conflict.

“Our assistance will prioritise the immediate needs of civilians, ensuring support reaches those most in need.

“We call for the protection of, and unimpeded access for, humanitarian workers who are delivering lifesaving support.”",,2500,"{'like_count': 2085, 'comment_count': 415, 'num_users': 113920}",Penny Wong,,2023-10-14 23:28:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/393215757_7145495005463208_959853404110827527_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=sRDMrEkvgBsAX_YEepu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC587KvW4LBzfSAhOFp4SFpzdtQkDgKrGc4kX3vZXojVQ&oe=655B50A1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZc6KYPvn6/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390974347_658688459728427_3312691186531804223_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=-PJDgiMzvo8AX_vmPk2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCZcRIikQkuX5FwcdgEHRUvCDj3tpPKbR2Y37FHicdgKA&oe=65495750

instagram,"Israel’s evacuation order is creating chaos in Gaza. A ground invasion will be worse.

The situation on the ground in Gaza is “fast becoming untenable,” Martin Griffiths, the @un_ocha chief, said in a statement Saturday. 

On Monday, the Israeli government shut off Gaza’s access to water, electricity, and fuel as part of its declared siege of the region. Gaza has been under blockade by both Israel and Egypt since 2007, and access to basic goods, including food and medicine, is available only via the UN and nongovernmental organizations.

“I fear that the worst is yet to come,” Griffiths added.

Since Hamas, the militant Islamic group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, launched an unprecedented and brutal attack against Israel that killed at least 1,300 people a week ago, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) has dropped at least 6,000 bombs over Gaza. Those operations have so far killed more than 1,500 Palestinians, including civilians. Meanwhile, an IDF ground invasion seems imminent.

More than 2 million Gazans live in a strip of land the size of Philadelphia, making it one of the most densely populated places on the planet, which increases the possibility of hitting civilians during military operations. And about 42.5 percent of the population is under the age of 14, making childhood casualties common in times of conflict.

Supplies like food, fuel, medicine, and clean water are already running critically low in the region, and as of yet, since borders remain closed, there is no humanitarian corridor to get supplies into Gaza — or get people out.

instagram,"U.S. Army Hawk anti-aircraft missiles pointed out over the Florida Straits in Key West, Florida, on October 27, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. On this day in 1962, an American U-2 spy plane took hundreds of photos of nuclear missile sites being built by the Soviet Union on the island of Cuba. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a tense and dangerous confrontation between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Cuba in October 1962. 

It is considered one of the most critical moments of the Cold War and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. The crisis began when the United States discovered that the Soviet Union was secretly deploying nuclear missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida. Upon learning of the Soviet missile installations in Cuba, U.S. President John F. Kennedy and his advisors debated the best course of action. 

They considered various options, including diplomacy, a surgical air strike on the missile sites, and a full-scale invasion of Cuba. Kennedy decided on a naval blockade, known as a ""quarantine,"" to prevent further Soviet shipments of military equipment to Cuba. Tensions escalated rapidly as both the United States and the Soviet Union prepared for potential military conflict. For 13 days, the world watched anxiously, fearing the outbreak of nuclear war.

President Kennedy addressed the nation in a televised speech on October 22, 1962, informing the public about the crisis and announcing the quarantine. He said: ""It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.""

Diplomatic negotiations took place behind the scenes, with Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev exchanging letters and messages to find a peaceful resolution. In a critical moment, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites in Cuba in exchange for a public pledge from the United States not to invade Cuba and a secret agreement to remove American missiles from Turkey. This agreement, reached in late October 1962, resolved the immediate crisis.",,2029,"{'like_count': 2021, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 119980}",🦅 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐚𝐭𝐏𝐢𝐱 🦅,,2023-10-14 17:19:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/136541177_179755680500939_7922402177606723056_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=k3D-S31Vp-UAX99D0mI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDMP_WtAryNfdN7CaBuq12iuyLKkyzw5XHJF_bX50s7hA&oe=655B2365,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyYypvIs0C5/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391130770_313649077944858_6991718227182461977_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Od3DHFN6YDsAX8Un583&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDyaMT1tHbMLXLwo4fvfGaIANTzv3AohuSnmpCMPEFb1w&oe=654AF798

instagram,"On 14 October 1066 the armies of William, the Duke of Normandy, and the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson clashed near Hastings, in one of the most famous battles in history and one that would decide the fate of the English throne.

Unusually for battles of the time, the clash at Hastings lasted all day. The conflict was only ended by groups of Anglo-Saxon warriors breaking discipline and charging from out of their shield wall. They were then surrounded, cut off, before being cut down by Norman warriors. Late in the day, the Anglo-Saxon King Harold was hit in the eye with an arrow. It was a fatal blow. With their king dead, the retreating Anglo-Saxons were defeated. The Normans were victorious.

instagram,"His Highness Prince Faisal Alfarhan received Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to discuss in Riyadh . During the meeting, the Saudi Foreign Minister reiterated that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia strongly rejects any calls for the forced displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza and condemns targeting civilians in any form. The minister stressed that the Kingdom calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and its surrounding areas, lifting the siege on Gaza as per the international law, and ensuring the entry of urgent humanitarian aid, such as food and medicine.
 He emphasized the importance of taking swift collective action to end the ongoing cycle of violence and all forms of military escalation against civilians to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.
 Prince Faisal emphasized the urgent need to prevent more innocent civilians from falling victim to the ongoing cycle of violence. He stressed that Israel must abide by international humanitarian law and avoid any actions that contradict it, as such actions will only worsen the current crisis and increase the suffering in the region.
 He also underlined that dialogue is the only way to achieve a just and comprehensive political solution to the conflict. He called on the international community to fulfill its responsibility in stopping the violence and promoting the peace process as per the resolutions of the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, and the Arab Peace Initiative",,1887,"{'like_count': 1811, 'comment_count': 76, 'num_users': 55837}",Reema Bint Bandar Al Saud,,2023-10-14 17:17:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/148606987_271137144433200_4679654678349448065_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AKPNsFlf4iEAX_9btZ4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCxbh5060o5KDG7ruoiBMG4QIIJs2gN0YAS58dMTcYJ7Q&oe=655B154B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyYyc2NLG3I/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391426441_710546853792959_8096865210940397874_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=3ZcZVPi3ovIAX9b1Pyx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBeChm2ZdZ1uGPOzdwSgFaWZ__dDmlIpGrj-0YNhUpJWg&oe=655A07A0
instagram,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly reconsidered its foreign policy priorities amid the Israeli onslaught against the besieged Gaza Strip by postponing a US-brokered normalization deal with the occupying entity and getting closer to Iran.

“Saudi Arabia is putting US-backed plans to normalize ties with Israel on ice,” two sources familiar with Riyadh's thinking told Reuters on Friday, as war escalates between Israel and Palestinian resistance movements.

“The conflict has also pushed the kingdom to engage with Iran,” the sources added, stressing that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took his first phone call from Iranian President Ebrahim Raeisi as Riyadh tries to prevent a broader surge in violence across the region.

The two sources described the delay in the US-backed talks on normalization with Israel as a “key step” for the kingdom to secure what Riyadh considers the real prize of a US military pact in exchange.

instagram,"Ya Allah, our hearts are breaking for the Palestinians 🇵🇸💔. We watch live as the women and children are murdered, their homes and families destroyed.  We feel helpless, heartbroken, guilty, despondent, angry, disappointed 😢. What more can we do, where are those who can help, how are people seeing all this and allowing it to go on!!?? 

This is not a conflict, this is murder, this is genocide and if we are not able to help in any way the least we can do is continue to share what we are seeing, inform others about what really is happening and make dua, make lots of dua for the Palestinians.

Gaza currently has no power, no water and the Israeli’s continue their gruesome attacks.  This is not a religious matter, there are many Christian’s and Jews in Gaza and many all over the world speaking out about the injustices towards the Palestinians 💔

Alhumdulillah, we sit in the comfort and safety of our homes trying to go on with our usual routines but how do we unsee and ignore what is happening to the people of Gaza😭. Oh people of Palestine, people of Gaza you have been given the honor of living in these blessed lands and with that you will be given the strength to endure.  We stand with you oh Palestinians,  even if all we can offer you is our duas and our tears!!

Yah Allah send your mercy upon the people of Palestine.  Grant them relief from the struggles and challenges they are currently facing and replace all that they have lost with more and better.  Bless them with Aafiyah and strength to overcome those who oppress them and You deal with their oppressors in a way that is befitting.

instagram,"The US intelligence community produced at least two assessments based in part on intelligence provided by Israel warning the Biden administration of an increased risk for Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the weeks ahead of Saturday’s attack on southern Israel, according to sources familiar with the intelligence.

One update from September 28 warned, based on multiple streams of intelligence, that the Hamas was poised to escalate rocket-attacks across the border. 

An October 5 wire from the CIA warned generally of the increasing possibility of violence by Hamas. 

Then, on October 6, the day before the attack, US officials circulated reporting from Israel indicating unusual activity by Hamas — indications that are now clear: an attack was imminent.

None of the American assessments offered any tactical details or indications of the overwhelming scope, scale and sheer brutality of the operation that Hamas carried out on October 7, sources say. It is unclear if any of these US assessments were shared with Israel, which provides much of the intelligence that the US bases its reports on.💢 #wakeupamerica #wakeupworld

instagram,"As part of the humanitarian efforts undertaken by the UAE to provide urgent assistance to the Palestinian people, the UAE red crescent have launched a campaign to provide relief aid to the Palestinian people impacted by the war in the Gaza Strip, under the theme ‘Tarahum - for Gaza’.

The campaign will be inaugurated on Sunday, 15th October 2023, in Abu Dhabi, under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent at the Abu Dhabi Ports Hall in Mina Zayed from 9 am - 4 pm, and will be organized across the rest of the Emirates at a later date.
this campaign aims to mitigate the severity of the humanitarian conditions, and alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable groups, especially children, who constitute nearly half of the population of the Gaza Strip. More than one million children are affected by the current conflict, and the campaign will work towards providing children and mothers with basic needs, in addition to health supplies and general hygiene materials. 
The aid will be sent through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

أطلقت دولة الامارات العربية المتحدة حملة لإغاثة الاشقاء الفلسطينيين المتأثرين من الحرب في قطاع غزة، تحت شعار ""تراحم من أجل غزة"". 
تنطلق الحملة الاحد غداً في أبوظبي تحت إشراف هيئة الهلال الأحمر الاماراتي في قاعة موانئ ابوظبي في ميناء زايد من الساعة 9 صباحا – 4 عصرا، على ان يتم تنظيمها في باقي الإمارات لاحقاً.
 وتهدف هذه الحملة التضامن مع الأطفال الفلسطينيين والأسر المتأثرة من الحرب الدائرة والعمل على التخفيف من حدة الأوضاع الإنسانية، ورفع المعاناة عن الفئات الأكثر ضعفا وخاصة الأطفال الذين يشكلون ما يقرب من نصف سكان القطاع (ما يزيد على مليون طفل) من خلال توفير الاحتياجات الأساسية لهم ولامهاتهم إضافة إلى المستلزمات الصحية ومواد النظافة العامة.

instagram,"I will not remain silent, while a one-sided narrative is used to justify the intensification of war against innocent people and what is looking like another round of Palestinian ethnic cleansing. 

I will say it again for those who twist my words and smear my name, I do not condone indiscriminate slaughter when Hamas does it, and I don't support it when Israel does it.

The Palestinians have been under a blockade for over a decade, and that is important context. It is simply not accurate to portray this current iteration of the conflict as unprovoked or out of nowhere.

People repeat that Israel has tried everything and there would be peace if the Palestinians didn't choose terror, etc just in the same way people repeated mask up to stay safe and the shot is safe and effective. 

This also blatantly ignores the fact that Israel funded and fuled Hamas as a strategy to delegitimize the 2-state solution. 

My main aim is to provide context and push back against the dehumanizing tactics being used to manipulate public perception to justify the most unimaginable horrors.

instagram,"Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon🌈

The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. Primarily developed during live performances, the band premiered an early version of the record several months before recording began. The record was conceived as an album that focused on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental health problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London.

The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work.

A concept album, the themes of The Dark Side of the Moon explore conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew, as well as philosophical quotations, were also used. The sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson, following keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a ""simple and bold"" design, representing the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: ""Money"" and ""Us and Them"".

instagram,"3/3
The ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict has reached a tipping point. The Palestinian issue remains unresolved, and Israel's continued mistreatment of Palestinians tarnishes its self-proclaimed moral standing as a state. The current status quo is unsustainable, and the conflict provides an ongoing source of regional instability.

Terrorism by definition is: “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political or other aims.”… this violent act….when perpetrated by people it is terrorism, and when perpetrated by a state it’s called state terrorism…..

What #israel under the brutal regime of Netanyahu has been practicing is considered state terrorism.

The conflict's consequences extend beyond the immediate violence, with implications for regional security and Israel's moral standing. The international community must reassess its approach to the Israel-#palestine conflict, emphasizing diplomacy, human rights, and justice to pave the way for a more peaceful future. 

Moreover, the conflict with the Palestinians will continue to provide Israel's arch-enemies in the region and their proxies, with the perfect recipe they need to destabilize the region and continually threaten Israel's national security.  While Israel is likely to prevail militarily over its enemies, alone or with the unquestionable support of its allies-namely the United States-albeit at an increasing cost in blood and treasure, it cannot stop the most dangerous threat of all – the erosion of the moral foundation on which Israel was founded - as a consequence of its ongoing deadly brutal occupation.

The last time the world witnessed this level of “media campaign” was 2002-2003 which resulted in US occupation of Iraq and the loss of lives of over 1 million Iraqis and 5000 US troops…..followed by an “sorry we were wrong” 🥲🥲😓😓

In a world scarred by the pain of war, we cannot overlook the countless innocent lives shattered by violence and the existence of corrupt leaders. The faces of these children, the voices of these women, and the stories of the vulnerable must not be forgotten. They are the silent victims, the casualties of conflicts not of their making.

Yet, in the darkness of despair, there is hope. We find peace in the belief that, in the end, God will prevail and justice will be served. 

While it may seem like an eternity, we have to remember that time is but a passing moment in the grand scheme of existence. A moment where justice may be delayed, but not denied.

🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 (5/5 Stars)

Review:

👉As a teacher interacting with middle school students, I sometimes explore books outside my usual genres to recommend engaging reads to them. ""The Veil of Corruption"" had me stepping into the enchanting world of witches and wizards, and I must say, it was a spellbinding journey!

👉This is the second book in The Virus of Beauty series, and I strongly recommend starting with the first one to fully appreciate the intricate narrative. The story picks up seamlessly, plunging us deeper into a realm filled with magic, suspense, and captivating characters.

👉The conflict between witches and wizards adds a unique twist to the storyline, keeping me eagerly turning the pages to discover what unfolds next. What's truly remarkable is the author's skill in crafting a world that immerses readers completely. I found it nearly impossible to put the book down once I started.

👉The protagonist, Wilf, faces a whirlwind of challenges, from finding a cure for the Virus of Beauty to dealing with the corruption of the protective Veil that separates witches and wizards from the outside world. As his bond with the witch Katryna deepens, they are confronted by malevolent forces that kidnap her, setting Wilf on a mission to save not only the Magical Realm but also the one he cares for the most.

👉""The Veil of Corruption"" is an outstanding young adult urban fantasy that delivers magic, action, adventure, and a whole lot more. The stakes are higher than ever, and the story's dramatic developments and suspenseful moments keep you on the edge of your seat.

👉If you're a fan of tightly woven, intriguing YA fantasies with originality, tension, and quirky characters, this series is a must-read! I can't wait to see where the next book in the series takes us.

In contrast, Israel possesses nuclear weapons, a formidable Air Force, financial support from the United States, and the political backing of Western nations. This glaring power imbalance has been whitewashed by Israel and its allies to depict this tragedy as a “conflict of equals”.

When Western media and governments attribute equal blame to unarmed Palestinian civilians and brutal Israeli military forces, they perpetuate a profound injustice. The world's response to the mistreatment of Palestinians, especially Palestinian women, has been inconsistent, highlighting a disheartening inherent bias.

The Western world's hypocrisy is further exemplified by the European Union's stated objectives of promoting values, human rights, and democracy. Yet, EU countries like France and the Netherlands have banned protesters from displaying the Palestinian flag. This selective application of principles underscores the western world’s hypocrisy and ugly face, calls into question its commitment to human rights and international law, and constitutes aiding and abetting war crimes.

Israel's atrocities in Gaza, including the use of internationally prohibited white phosphorus bombs on Gaza, withholding access to electricity, water, and the internet in Gaza, and conducting indiscriminate bombing with impunity on the civilian population, hospitals, schools, UN camps, ambulances and even killing 70 children and women in a fleeing convoy is an absolute barbarism, and amounts to crimes against humanity, and a war crime. 

The situation in Palestine has been characterized as apartheid by organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and numerous Israeli human rights organizations.

instagram,"📚 BOOK REVIEW 📚 

""Consequential Urges"" by Bruno Beaches is a gripping exploration of the human psyche under the weight of profound loss and internal conflict. The narrative, centered around the character Pablo, intricately weaves the complexities of grief, frustration, and the struggle for self-control.

Beaches artfully portrays Pablo's evolution, drawing readers into the tumultuous journey of a man who, despite his strength and power, grapples with inner demons. The thematic exploration of violence as a coping mechanism is both raw and poignant, offering readers a window into the darker recesses of the human soul.

The introduction of a psychologist adds depth to the narrative, providing a psychological lens through which Pablo attempts to unravel the complexities of his urges. This nuanced approach to mental health adds a layer of authenticity, as it delves into the internal struggles individuals face in the aftermath of profound loss.

The title, ""Consequential Urges,"" hints at the inevitability of repercussions, and Beaches skillfully crafts a narrative that explores the law of unforeseen consequences. As Pablo's actions escalate, the story takes unexpected turns, keeping readers on the edge of their seats. The suspenseful build-up adds a layer of unpredictability, making each page turn a compelling experience.

The exploration of fate and the possibility of a surprise guardian angel introduces an element of hope, offering a glimmer of redemption in the face of self-destructive choices. Beaches masterfully navigates the delicate balance between despair and hope, creating a narrative that resonates with the complexities of the human condition.

In ""Consequential Urges,"" Bruno Beaches delivers a thought-provoking tale that goes beyond a mere exploration of violence and consequences. It becomes a meditation on resilience, redemption, and the profound impact of unforeseen events on the human experience. Beaches' prose is both evocative and introspective, making this novel a compelling read for those who appreciate a blend of psychological depth and unpredictable storytelling.

instagram,"Nearly eight in 10 Americans fear the war that erupted this week between Israel and Hamas will lead to a broader war in the Middle East, according to the latest PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll.

With seven in 10 U.S. adults saying they are closely following what is happening, the anxiety about further escalation is shared across political affiliation, geography, gender, race, income, education and age. A third of U.S. adults said they were “very concerned” about wider violence in the region, according to this latest poll.

Hamas militants made an unprecedented incursion into Israel during the early hours of Oct. 7, firing thousands of rockets and sending fighters past Israel’s blockade of Gaza to launch  deadly attacks on several communities and take scores of hostages. The combined death toll from both the surprise assault as well as Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in response has risen to at least 2,800 lives.

On Friday, Israel ordered 1.1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, despite a warning from the United Nations that the short deadline could be disastrous. The evacuation orders come ahead of Israel’s anticipated ground invasion against Hamas. In recent days, Israel cut off food, water and electricity to the besieged area, where more than 2 million predominantly Palestinian residents have been ruled since 2007 by Hamas, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group.

The violent conflict has inflamed long-running animosity between Israel and its neighbors, with Turkey calling that nation’s response “a massacre” and Iran warning that war could spread to other fronts. Israel announced on Friday that it had launched drone attacks against Hezbollah targets, amid other skirmishes along the Lebanese border. On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he “appealed to all parties” to quell violence, release Israeli hostages and respect international humanitarian law.

instagram,"It is truly heartbreaking to witness innocent civilians, including women, children, sons, and daughters, losing their lives in a conflict that they have no part in. It pains me to see the devastating impact that hatred and division have on our world.

In times like these, it is natural to question why there is so much hate in the world. It is a difficult question to answer, as hate often stems from a complex web of historical, cultural, and political factors. But amidst the darkness, we must hold onto the flickering flame of hope, believing that love and unity can eventually triumph over hate.

It is crucial to remember that the majority of people long for peace, regardless of their nationality, religion, or background. We must amplify the voices of those who yearn for unity, understanding, and reconciliation. Together, we can build bridges of compassion and empathy, fostering an environment where differences are celebrated rather than feared.

While we may not have the power to single-handedly end this conflict, we can contribute to a more peaceful world in our own small ways. By spreading awareness, engaging in respectful dialogue, supporting humanitarian efforts, and promoting cultural understanding, we can sow the seeds of peace. Let us stand together, united in our commitment to a future free from violence and suffering.

Remember, my friend, that even in the darkest of times, hope remains a beacon of light. Let us nurture that hope and work towards a world where love, compassion, and unity prevail over hate. Together, we can make a difference.

instagram,"⚔️ The day that changed England forever 🛡

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 
In 1066, England witnessed a seismic clash of kings at the Battle of Hastings. On one side, you had the ambitious Norman Duke, William the Conqueror, and on the other, the English monarch, King Harold II. With destiny hanging in the balance, arrows flew, swords clashed, and by day's end, William emerged victorious. This epic showdown altered the course of England's history, launching the Norman conquest and forever transforming the island nation.

After the Battle of Hastings and William the Conqueror's triumph, he was crowned King of England, marking the beginning of Norman rule. This event initiated a significant shift in English society and politics. William introduced Norman customs, language, and a feudal system, consolidating his rule. The Domesday Book, a comprehensive survey of England, was commissioned to record and assess land and property, providing a valuable historical record. The Norman influence on English culture, law, and language shaped the foundation for the modern English nation.

According to legend, King Harold II was fatally struck in the eye by an arrow during the battle. This single event is often cited as a turning point in the conflict, leading to the English defeat and William the Conqueror's victory. While the historical accuracy of this account is debated, it has become a symbol of the battle and the Norman Conquest.

A less commonly known detail about the Battle of Hastings is the role weather played in the outcome. The battle occurred on October 14, 1066, a day that saw particularly strong winds blowing in the faces of Harold II's English troops. This weather condition is said to have affected the flight path of the Norman arrows, making them more accurate and deadly. The wind was an unforeseen factor that influenced the battle's course and contributed to William the Conqueror's victory.

💬 What does your weekend look like?

💭I loved the writing in this book. It was captivating and nostalgic. I had not read a fantasy novel in so long and this was such a beautiful way to revisit the magic. 

Despite the fantastical nature of the characters, there was something so completely human in how they perceived the world and experienced internal conflict. 

Five stars. It was beautiful. The pain experienced reading this was worth it for the magic that is this book (IYKYK). 

This book is the GIF of Goofy floating in a pool (seriously stop reading this and Google it right now if you don’t know what I’m talking about) in the best ways. If anyone needs me I’ll just be a soul floating out of my body for a while.

📖 Synopsis: Around the world, black hand prints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.

In a dark and dusty shop, a devil’s supply of human teeth grows dangerously low.

And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherworldly war.

Meet Karou. She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real, she’s prone to disappearing on mysterious ""errands"", she speaks many languages - not all of them human - and her bright blue hair actually grows out of her head that color. Who is she? That is the question that haunts her, and she’s about to find out.

When beautiful, haunted Akiva fixes fiery eyes on her in an alley in Marrakesh, the result is blood and starlight, secrets unveiled, and a star-crossed love whose roots drink deep of a violent past.

instagram,"On October 12, Beka Munduruku, an Indigenous leader, went to the Cargill headquarters in Minneapolis to deliver a letter to the Cargill-MacMillan family, denouncing the violence the company has been committing against Amazonian peoples. 

Beka appeals to Cargill to stop violating the rights of indigenous peoples and to cease promoting the destruction of the Amazon through large infrastructure projects and the expansion of soy cultivation. Beka mentions the mega-railway Ferrogrão as an example of this destruction. The project could impact 16 indigenous lands and cause more than 2,000 square kilometers of Amazon deforestation. Read below:

""Dear Cargill MacMillan Family, we, the Munduruku people, are fighting for our land. For our children. For Indigenous people dying trying to protect their land from your suppliers. 

As the owners of Cargill, we ask you to stop operating in conflict areas and on land taken from Indigenous people. This must be more than just another promise. There must be assurances and action.""

instagram,"The Kalidindi Inscription is a brief snapshot of the Chola-Chalukya Wars—a conflict that raged for nearly a century between the Deccan and Tamilakam, killed thousands, and left dozens of towns and temples despoiled. 

In 1044–45, while Rajadhiraja Chola was busy settling into his position as the new emperor, his rival Someshvara Kalyana Chalukya—lord of the Deccan—moved to take advantage. An invasion of Vengi was mounted to place the half brother of the Vengi Chalukya king on the throne. The latter was the son and husband of Chola princesses, and called for aid. A Chola general with the title of “Rajaraja’s Great Brahmin King”, described as guarding the kingdom “like a serpent protecting hidden treasure”, was dispatched to defend Narendra. He was accompanied by a magnate-turned-official from the Tondai region, as well as another important general. At the Battle of Kalidindi—just two days’ march from the Eastern Chalukya capital—the Cholas managed to fight the Western Chalukyas to a standstill. But all three generals were killed. Narendra built temples to Shiva over their interred remains, praying desperately for his throne. It is this series of events that are commemorated in the Kalidindi inscription. 

Rajadhiraja Chola then took the field. In a series of battles the Western Chalukyas were driven back from coastal Vengi, from where they withdrew upriver along the Godavari River to the fortified citadel of Kollipakam (Kolipaka in present-day Telangana). Rajadhiraja Chola claimed that he caused it to be “consumed by fire”; meanwhile Someshvara Chalukya declared one of his vassals “protector of Kollipaka”. The actual outcome is unclear, but the Chalukya emperor withdrew and occupied himself with affairs to his north and west.

The Chola-Chalukya Wars would eventually lead to Rajadhiraja Chola's death on the battlefield and Someshvara Chalukya's suicide.

The recent escalation of violence in the Israel-Gaza conflict has sparked a devastating and complex crisis. This conflict began with rocket attacks from #gaza , primarily carried out by Hamas' military wing, Al Qassam Brigade, which is designated as a terrorist organization. In response, #israel launched indiscriminate retaliatory airstrikes. Tragically, over 2,500 lives, both Israeli and Palestinian, have been lost in this ongoing violence.

Attacks on civilians is a clear violation of international law, constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity. The horrors of this conflict should evoke outrage and condemnation from anyone with a moral compass. However, if our collective outrage and empathy only arose in the wake of these recent events, we must really examine our own values and priorities.

The violence against innocent civilians, regardless of the underlying cause, is inexcusable. Kidnapping civilians, as Hamas has done, should be unequivocally condemned. Yet, there is a stark contrast in the level of international outrage between incidents like this and the ongoing violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and Gaza. The daily suffering of Palestinian women, children, the elderly, and men often receives almost no attention and condemnation. 

This dishonesty represents a troubling double standard.

Israel's blockade of Palestinian territories, intensified since Netanyahu came to power 16 years ago and has reached its peak the last 3-4 years, has left the population without freedom of movement, making it challenging for them to pursue education, seek medical treatment, or connect with relatives. This is not a defense of Hamas but a recognition of the suffocating conditions many Palestinians endure.

Decades of violence, intimidation, imprisonment, ethnic cleansing, and dehumanization of the Palestinian population by the Israel Defense Forces and illegal extremist settlers have been building towards a breaking point. Palestinians have been living as refugees for generations on their own land, lacking statehood, equal or even basic rights, or a military to defend themselves.",,1065,"{'like_count': 1064, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 59710}",Mehmet Çelebi,,2023-10-14 16:04:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/350479633_942518690348133_5442185857940877596_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=t8H4EfjtvKoAX8JynXN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDvoQPLbU52xVPYhrW2W5m6TRfkIze7I_nYqbUsShp1-g&oe=655A3665,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyYqD27sx37/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391367685_1783858045386679_7434402961626895994_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SQqLOBDe_zQAX9VDtHe&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC5Mvc4X-jiSYhW7o_O9lrv5BUrztQQ44erygRvnFnJRA&oe=654E9B0A
instagram,"Axios reports that Iran has warned Israel it will take direct action to intervene should Israel launch a ground offensive in Gaza. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian met with UN envoy to the Middle East Tor Wennesland on Saturday in Beirut, according to diplomatic sources, to convey the message.

Iran's message, sent to Israel through the UN, comes as the Biden administration has been trying to deter Iran and Lebanon-backed Hezbollah, supported by Iran, from joining the war, even sending the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group to the Israeli coast to be ready for any hostile actions by Iran. Such a move by Iran, either by Iranian forces or a militant group such as Hezbollah, could expand the conflict to engulf the entire Middle East.

The UAE, recently aligned with Israel through the Abraham Accords, has sent a message warning Syria to refrain from active participation in the conflict.

According to Axios, Wennesland urged Amir-Abdollahian to help prevent a spillover of the conflict in Gaza and Israel to the wider region in the Middle East. The Iranian foreign minister replied that Iran doesn't want the conflict to turn into a regional war and wants to try and help with the release of civilians who are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. At the same time, he stressed that Iran has limits of its own - among them a ground offensive in Gaza. Should that happen, Amir-Abdollahian commented, Iran would be left with no choice but to intervene. 🎭🎤

West “will make a decision soon,” says one source. And while sources say the album release was originally planned for Friday (Oct. 13), it was pushed back and is expected to land in the coming weeks.

The project has record industry executives weighing the risks and rewards of releasing what some who’ve heard the music say is West’s best music in at least five years, since 2018’s Ye, but at an especially fraught time as the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies following the surprise attack on the Supernova Sukkot Gathering music festival on Oct. 7 👀💿

instagram,"On this date in 1977, @davidbowie - ""Heroes"" was released.

📈 #5 for 1977, #164 overall

""Shapeshifting is probably the one thing that best defines David Bowie as a recording artist. His ability to appropriate wildly different sounds and styles and make them work for him is unparalleled, and in many ways betrays a more unique voice than most other musicians. But while change was a constant in his career, there are certain records in David Bowie's discography where he feels particularly comfortable or in control, and for me, Heroes is one of those records.

...Heroes feels like a more careful reintegration of the best traits of 'Low' into Bowie's style to create a new and different record, and one that feels extraordinarily natural. His second album of 1977, it was written and recorded rapidly over the course of just a month, with much of the material either ad-libbed, or written just hours before recording. 

...The success of this album is all in the way in which the unusual and the experimental is so effortlessly collapsed into the existing genius of David Bowie as a rock musician, making a record that’s simultaneously oblique as well as direct. This conflict is central to much of his music, but on Heroes, it feels particularly well-realised. The only mystery here is how Bowie and company managed to do it so damn well."" - RYM user Greenmountain

instagram,"When it comes to that point where you don't know what decision to make amongst options to marry. 

When you can't seem to find any peace in your soul to go on with the person you have chosen to marry. 

Shut down everything. 

Hold up that proposal.

Delay that wedding.

Emotionally disconnect from that person for a few days. 

And spend some good time with the Holy Spirit.

Do not talk too much in the place of prayer, its not about long hours of tongues, it's more about long hours of meditative listening.

Just listen.

Meditate on the Word and just listen. 

Learn the art of emotionally disconnecting to hear from the Lord.

Your problem is you want to talk mushy on the phone with that person for 3hours, then pray 5minutes and expect 21 Angels to appear in your dream with an answer from God. 

You want to go on dates and spend the weekend together, then read one verse of the Bible and expect to ascend into the inner courts of God for an encounter that will reveal the name of your spouse.

Our emotions will always be in conflict with our discernment.

Our emotions will remain the greatest resistance to an encounter with God in whatever form.

Disconnect, go away with God for a while, so that you can hear clearly. 

And, if you know you are not going to trust the Voice of the Lord on whatever reply you get in prayer, then you might as well just go ahead and have the wedding today. Send me the address to the reception, I'll love to attend.

All the best in your marriage.

instagram,"Opinion | @usmani.aban writes:

After the bloody weekend attacks by Hamas on Israel, global opinion and the media seem to be divided. While a few Israeli papers, including Haaretz, have placed the blame entirely on Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, in India – similar to sections of the American and British press – mainstream television news and a few other outlets have decided to hound opposition leaders who have tried to delve into the “fundamental” problem of the long-standing demand of Palestinian statehood or Israeli violations of human rights instead of only attributing the conflict to one outfit. 

Media outlets in any country usually follow their country’s policy on labelling any outlet as “terrorist”. But in the case of Hamas, several prominent outlets in the US and UK have resisted the label. The BBC, for example, put out a statement this week explaining why it will not call the Palestinian group so despite the UK government proscribing the outfit. In the US, the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and Washington Post have mostly been using the word militant to describe the outfit even though US President Joe Biden has unequivocally blamed the “terrorist” group for the crisis.

However, for a lot of celebrities and Indian news anchors such as Arnab Goswami, Amish Devgan, and Aman Chopra, you are either with Israel or with terrorists.

instagram,"The Tanzanian government said on Saturday, October 14, that it will start evacuating its citizens in Israel following the outbreak of conflict with Palestine.

The Israel-Hamas fight, which broke out last Saturday, has left thousands dead and others misplaced.

Two Tanzanians have been reportedly missing since the outbreak of the fighting.

“Following the deteriorating security situation in Israel and neighbouring areas, the government has prepared a plan to bring back home Tanzanians who are there,” the ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

The ministry is urging Tanzanians to register through the Tel Aviv-based embassy before midnight on October 15, 2023.

instagram,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, has announced that any posts or comments supporting Hamas will be removed as part of ongoing efforts regarding the Israel-Hamas War.

It was recently announced that steps are being taken to control misinformation about the war on their platforms.

These steps will include removing any Hamas-related posts or comments, as well as deleting content that ""clearly identifies hostages"" in the ongoing conflict, according to the tech giant.

Meta stated that it will enforce its policies pertaining to dangerous organizations and individuals, violent and graphic content, hate speech, violence and incitement, bullying and harassment, and harm coordination.

instagram,"If you’re using social media to try and stay on top of what’s happening in Gaza and Israel right now, you should know that Elon Musk’s recent changes to Twitter have left the  platform awash in inflammatory inaccurate content about the conflict.

Changes like removing ways to report inaccurate content on the platform, rolling out paid verification that makes verification meaningless while algorithmically prioritizing content from paid users, and a monetization scheme that creates a financial incentive for posting engaging fake content has left Twitter not just unusable, but actively dangerous. 

We’ve seen clips from video games being posted to Twitter purporting to show footage from the ground, stills taken from film sets purporting to show people “faking” injuries on the ground, a faked White House press release falsely claiming the Biden admin is releasing billions of dollars in aid to Israel and much much more, all amplified (not to mention potentially monetized!) by people with verified blue checks on the platform. 

It’s dangerous! Twitter has always had its problems, but it was once the best platform for following on the ground updates of ongoing situations and now it’s a marketplace for inflammatory garbage. It’s actively shaping the public perception of what’s happening in the conflict. 
The health, well being, and safety of our people is linked to the health well being and safety of our digital platforms.

I’ve personally never seen anything like it. We are simply not prepared for how bad this is. We are simply not prepared for how much worse this could get.

We did a frustrating deep dive into all of this on the podcast There Are No Girls on the Internet.

instagram,"This is Rawand. I photographed her as she paddled for a wave in Gaza nearly 12 years ago. I kept in contact with her since then as she continued her studies, graduated from university, married and became a mother. The sense of isolation for Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip permeates every aspect of their lives. Barely anyone goes in or out since 2007, when both Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade after Hamas took full control of the enclave and abolished elections, along with any political opposition. Since Hamas’ brutal attack that killed hundreds of Israeli civilians a week ago and the Israeli military response that flattened entire city blocks and killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians, I wrote to check on her, feeling heavy with worry and guilt for my complete powerlessness to help her. She told me her home was completely destroyed and she was lucky to have escaped it just in time. “Pray for us” she said. Since then there’s barely been any electricity in Gaza, the IDF has ordered the evacuation of over a million people from the area where she lived, and I don’t know where she is now. I hope she’s safe, and that she’ll have a chance to return and rebuild her home one day. I hope Kholoud (seen on the second photo here) is also safe and that time and hardship didn’t make a dent in her clever, fierce, and deeply kind character. I hope enough people on both sides of this conflict choose to reject extremism and dehumanisation and that this bloody week will mark the beginning of the end of this war no one can ever win.

Palestinians deserve to live without fear.",,808,"{'like_count': 785, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 27333}",Alice Martins,,2023-10-14 19:04:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/365490133_1751349798655122_765774792143346214_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=1B5_7rDG49IAX9Cqi8X&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC6mJMRTmgq8dizRvca3_gSBQv6bElIRhclMJsjjiq7iA&oe=655B1769,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyY-tjbMibC/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391130224_1011509290120031_8236523325631700933_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=dOzD4lldRhcAX9BUIL0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDz7aT2Dj4MkHNWURbnYpBjqz8K98ADOtov8R67iBvU8A&oe=6559CBEF

Protesters held banners with messages reading ""free Palestine"", ""boycott Apartheid Israel"" and ""we won't be silenced"" as they marched through the city centre. 

Placards were also seen with the phrase ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"", which Home Secretary Suella Braverman has suggested could be an offence.

It comes as thousands of people have gathered for pro-Palestine protests up and down the country on Saturday (October 14), including in Edinburgh, London, and Manchester.

The promise’s to the Jewish people stands to this day. Apostle Paul said; “Did God reject his people? By no means!” (Romans 11:1). Paul also said to non Jewish believers concerning Israel; “You do not support the root, but the root supports you” (Romans 11:18). We (non Jewish christians) are grafted in branches in the Olive tree, wich is Israel. Israel and the Jews are our root. Let’s not cut our own tree down by standing on the wrong side in this current conflict. The Jewish people are still to this day His chosen people.

I still remember feeling my mom’s fear holding me tight as the raid horns would go off signaling a potential bombing as the airplanes flew over us. There are no winners in war.

I know there’s so much history and nuance to this conflict. I feel deep in my heart that It’s crucial to stop choosing sides and come together and unite for one cause, humanity and safety of everyone. No decent human wants to see another human hurt or killed. We all bleed the same red regardless of the color of our flags.

Malaysian Muslim activists and Palestinian living in Malaysia gathered to protest in solidarity with the Palestinians in the wake of the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 

On October 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched the largest surprise attack from Gaza in a generation, sending thousands of missiles and an unknown number of fighters by land, who shot and kidnapped Israelis in communities near the Gaza border. The attack prompted retaliatory strikes on Gaza and a declaration of war by the Israeli prime minister.

In an effort to ensure all Calgarians feel safe in our city, today our officers proactively increased patrols near local places of worship & other areas of significance.

It is standard practice for police to monitor all major, planned events & demonstrations, manage public safety, keep the peace & respond to any calls for service accordingly.

So far, there have been no incidents reported in Calgary in relation to the conflict in the Middle East.

We police behaviour, not beliefs. Hate-motivated crimes of any kind have no place in our community & we will not tolerate behaviour contrary to the law that is associated with hate speech or harassment.

Two Sri Lankan women, who allegedly attempted to enter Israel illegally from Jordan, were apprehended by Israeli security forces this morning. 

The Sri Lankan ambassador in Israel, Nimal Bandara, confirmed to the Daily Mirror that the Israeli authorities had promptly informed the embassy about the incident. 

The women's identities are yet to be established, and further information will be obtained from the authorities by tomorrow to determine the next steps, the ambassador added.

In light of the ongoing conflict with the Hamas group, Ambassador Bandara issued a warning to Sri Lankans planning to enter Israel illegally from the borders. 
""Please inform those intending to enter Israel through illegal routes not to proceed, as you will face the risk of being shot at,” he added. (SJ)

instagram,"Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine and Queen of Naples (1400-1453). She was the daughter of Charles II, Duke of Lorraine and his wife Margarete of the Palatinate.

She was born in France as the eldest daughter, her younger sister Catherine was born in (1407). She also had two brothers but these died young. After the death of her brothers, it was made apparent in (1410) that Isabella would be the successor of her father in Lorraine and was therefore given a careful education. 

On 24 October (1419), Isabella married René of Anjou. He was the son of King Louis II of Naples and thus a heir to the throne. The couple had ten children, three of whom survived childhood and early adolescence. 

Isabella inherited the duchy of Lorraine from her father upon his death in (1431), and ruled jointly with her husband as her co-ruler. In (1435), she also became queen of Naples when her husband succeeded his father as king. During her first time as queen, Isabella acted as her husband's general governor and regent, as he had been imprisoned after a conflict with Isabella's cousin regarding her inheritance rights to Lorraine. She remained in this position until her husband's release and arrival in Naples (1438).

In the 1440s, Isabella returned to Lorraine, where she continued to administer the duchy. In (1445), however, she appointed her son John to be her governor general in Lorraine, and retired to her manor Launay in Saumur.

As a person, Isabella has been described as witty and brave, with the ability to be careful and make hard decisions in difficult circumstances. In addition to that, she was praised for her beauty and sharp mind. She is also said to have been the one who introduced one of her ladies-in-waiting, Agnès Sorel, to King Charles VII of France. Agnès soon afterwards became the king's influential mistress and is considered the first officially recognized royal mistress of a French king. 

Isabella died on 28 February (1453), aged 53 and was buried in Cathédrale Saint-Maurice d'Angers in western France. #royalhistory #isabellaoflorraine #duchessoflorraine #houseofardennesmetz #frenchroyals #historicalroyals",,591,"{'like_count': 588, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 31720}",Royals from the past 🖤,,2023-10-14 23:26:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/337668739_569330008534045_905311638008472628_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=wUCLoV61g-8AX9z0kZB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC2tcoDd7OPNTlR-7tn9AC7dTmx7R4Mb0c7ZOGWhhhjeQ&oe=655A3AA1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZcrBFIAqG/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391030556_1269843973731510_1797216425491850398_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=he_Eb5X5CUoAX8j17wy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBB25Z2bFiSqpU-AjoA7O14ZETUxnAouR2MieFoNUedzQ&oe=65570F8F
instagram,"Sharing content during active conflict is a sensitive matter that requires careful consideration.🤝 Here are some guidelines to consider:

💭 Consider the Audience: Think about your audience and their sensitivities. Avoid sharing graphic content with individuals who may be triggered or distressed by it, such as children, those with PTSD, or people who have experienced trauma.

🔍 Verify the Source and Authenticity: Ensure that the content is from a credible source, and verify its authenticity to prevent spreading misinformation or propaganda. Use reputable news outlets, verified social media accounts, or fact-checking websites to confirm the information.

📚 Provide Background: When sharing distressing content, provide details to help your audience understand what they're seeing. Explain the situation, location, and any relevant background information. This can help prevent misunderstandings and misinformation.

⚠️ Content Warnings: Use content warnings or trigger warnings before sharing graphic images or videos. This gives people the choice to engage with the content or not, and it shows respect for their emotional well-being.

🚫 Respect Privacy and Dignity: Avoid sharing content that invades the privacy of individuals or portrays them in a demeaning or dehumanizing way. Respect the dignity of those affected by the conflict.

🤔 Evaluate the Relevance: Consider whether sharing the content serves a meaningful purpose, such as raising awareness, advocating for a cause, or documenting important events. Avoid sharing content for the sake of sensationalism.

They ended up hurting me (and not intentionally) but I had to remind myself that these people are hurting and hurting people show up very differently than healthy, happy people.

instagram,"“Can I just get a minute when you’re not throwing another problem in my face?” a senior doctor (Prakash Belawadi) asks his nurse (Balaji Gauri) at the Bombay General Hospital in the second season of Mumbai Diaries. She responds with – “you can get a samosa, an ice cream, maybe even a cola, but you can’t get a minute without a new problem cropping up.”

After all, it’s the nature of a government hospital – where resources are finite, but an ailment is always around to be treated. The first season of the Nikkhil Advani show was a medical drama – a group of young doctors grappling with the eternal push-and-pull with the administration and protocol that gets in the way of saving lives in the ER, with the aftermath of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

As a medical drama, Mumbai Diaries: 26/11 was just about there, ticking most of the boxes of the genre, led by a maverick doctor, Kaushik Oberoi (Mohit Raina) whose method often skirts the lines of brilliant instinct and reckless daredevilry. Surrounded by superiors who bat for his ways, rookies (Natasha Bharadwaj, Satyajeet Dubey and Mrunmayee Deshpande) who look up to him, Dr. Oberoi is emboldened to listen to his gut rather than following protocol to treat patients. It lent itself to a superb conflict in the first season, when the hotshot doctor tries to revive a gravely injured terrorist who shot a cop, after the cop’s condition goes beyond medical help. There’s resistance from within the hospital staff, cops, and even the slain cop’s spouse.

The second season begins a few months after the events of the first season, in the midst of a torrential downpour the city is known for. Even though the show’s events lie somewhere in June 2009, it uses the events of the 2005 floods that ravaged the city, as the springboard for events in the second season.

#lovedeleted by @paulindigoauthor 

Continuing on with the @lovebookstours #readalong and have to say this is a book I've enjoyed reading.

I love the characters, the little clues to what's going to happen next and the surprises. This is a book that will definitely make you think about love and communication in a whole new light.

Q3 - If you couldn't get hold of someone like Jethro has been trying to get hold of Cooper, what would you do?

I can see the conflict in this situation, he's just off on a tour, and has no reason to suspect anything is amiss. Then he finds out she is with his sister. 

But...Huge red flag that he cant locate her and even when he knows where she is he cant speak to her.

I'd definitely be doing more. Would have called round everyone first and gone out looking myself. Then insisted I speak to her 

Have you ever been in a situation where you couldn't locate someone? What did you do? Or what would you do?

instagram,"Breathing and the Metal Element

Autumn can be the time to lay the foundations of our health for the coming year. It is time to still our hearts and minds and to gather and collect our energy. Metal is the phase of energy represented by late autumn. It is the time when leaves fall to the earth and a time of refinement for the individual. Just as trees are drawing in and letting go of their leaves, it is time for us to let go of what we have been carrying around all year, but may no longer need.

In the animal kingdom, it is the time to store only what is needed for winter and let go of what can be discarded. Autumn is a time to reflect on the cycle of the seasons, and to be thankful for an abundant harvest. Consciously breathing helps us to release tension and to be grateful for the simple act of breathing. Breathing consciously each day can have an extraordinary effect on our health and create peace of mind through autumn and winter.

A person who exhibits the metal energy in balance is someone with integrity who is balanced and fair. They do not want disorder and conflict and prefer structure and stability. A metal person is typically an expert in their field and seeks perfection. They think logically and acting with methodical efficiency. When the metal element is out of balance, a person can be selfish, dishonest, lack integrity, and be sneaky.

instagram,"‘You can’t cure killed babies by killing more babies’
👆🏽That’s a quote from an Israeli man who’s mother is one of the hostages from hamas’ recent horrific attack.
What the militant far-right Israeli government is doing right now is a WAR CRIME (in retaliation to a war crime)… I see a lot of flag waving and people on BOTH SIDES trying to justify the death and bloodshed and further creating division and stress…
I’m privileged enough to be able to (try) see it from both sides and the overwhelming majority just want it to end and have peace… it’s a small handful of people perpetuating this cycle of violence… hamas are a PRODUCT of the occupation and of a devastated traumatised Palestinian people. They THRIVE under those conditions and the Israeli government know this… by bombing Gaza mercilessly they are only going to create MORE extremists and hate.
We need to try to end this vicious cycle that’s been going on for generations… We need the media and OUR governments to condemn  Israel’s reaction and to try end this indiscriminate killing of innocent people. hamas need to free the hostages too and fuck off! 
Just imagine… this is one of the ‘holiest’ places on earth and it’s DRENCHED in the blood of children. That goes a long way reinforcing my opposition to organised religion and the way it divides us and gives people a ‘free pass’ to do horrific things. It’s so dumb in this day and age (I’m all for peoples personal beliefs, but organised religion is too corrupt and irrational)… anyways, this conflict isn’t about religion, it’s about land and power and human rights, but the religion part doesn’t help! (I’m sorry Jewish people, you’re not the ‘chosen people’🤷🏽‍♂️ and I’m sorry Muslims, but just cos the Quran ‘hasn’t been altered in thousands of years’ doesn’t make it any more true 🤷🏽‍♂️)
I’m not gonna ‘pray for this to end’ bcos we all know praying does absolutely NOTHING… we need to have these difficult conversations, STOP the whole ‘eye for an eye’ bullsh*t and try our best to let LOVE not be drowned out by the sounds of HATE.",,477,"{'like_count': 440, 'comment_count': 37, 'num_users': 4876}",The Ambidextrous Wonder 🏴‍☠️,,2023-10-14 12:46:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11371022_862507630502075_790565343_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=I31IRoRfxhcAX_zBoO9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDomat-Yo-rcqbh_f-YYCw_K6cSulzPOdkA-Cn5c8fB4w&oe=655A5586,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyYTdKbIU1X/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391240578_874103507606823_9141013959395362033_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=7HkbjCDHVVIAX-YSkS8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBFqb4boc-33FuagqVafkuLz_Hh4Vbbgr4xfVlMTSWSEQ&oe=6559FB13
instagram,"Statement in response to misreporting on the rally for Palestine: 

After the protest in support of Palestine on Friday, October 13, the Fox8 news channel falsely reported that WHOA organized the action and agitated protestors to seize the street. 

This occurred after one of our comrades explicitly explained to Fox8 reporters that WHOA did not organize the action, and after Fox8 spoke to an actual organizer of the event for around 20 minutes.

We can only conclude that this story was purposefully misreported. 

The actual organizers of the event were Muslims for a Better NC and GRS, so we are told.

All WHOA did was elevate the action on our social media in solidarity with the organizers to bolster numbers and note our stance on the conflict. Some comrades attended the event, but in no way did WHOA play a leading role. 

We aren’t entirely certain why Fox8 misreported this story, but we can only imagine they did so to obfuscate the reality that the Muslim community broadly opposes Israel’s actions against the Palestinian people. For mainstream news outlets such as Fox8, it is more convenient to suppose that a pre-identified radical organization independently takes a strong stance on the conflict between Israel and Hamas, when, in reality, much of the community actually does oppose Israel’s actions.

instagram,"“We mourn the tragic deaths of those killed in Palestine and Israel,” says Rick Cober Bauman, MCC Canada Executive Director. “We lament this new wave of conflict and invite churches to pray for the many families whose loved ones have been killed in both Israel and Palestine.”

MCC is planning an emergency relief response with existing partners, focused on the immediate humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip, given the vulnerability of the population and lack of resources available to families. The initial response will include distributing food and bedding. In the longer-term, MCC also plans to respond with trauma healing support and housing reconstruction.

Currently, no food, fuel or medicine can enter Gaza, as the last remaining access from Egypt was shut down after airstrikes hit the border crossing. Communities in Gaza were already experiencing extreme hardships due to previous Israeli military operations and the 16-year blockade, which restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza. 

Sarah Funkhouser and Seth Malone, MCC staff, say that reports from MCC partners in Gaza are deeply troubling. 

“Our partners in Gaza are reporting a lot of bombing, more than they’ve ever seen before,” says Malone. “But we’re also hearing from partners that it’s not safe to be inside when buildings are being targeted like this. The situation is dire for civilians here, electricity is cut off, water is cut off, food is cut off.”

The building of one of MCC’s partners in the Gaza Strip, the Near East Council of Churches (NECC), was severely damaged by airstrikes, including its medicine storage facility and classrooms where job skills training took place. Many homes of partner staff have also been destroyed by bombing. Despite this devastation, partners are committed to helping those in need.

MCC is also urging world leaders to encourage immediate de-escalation and hold all parties to the same standard of international law regarding the protection of civilians and respect for human rights. We invite others to do the same. Links in bio.

Hamas was founded in 1987. Hamas literally killed 118 Fatah PLO and Pakistan authority members in Gaza. Leaving only hamas on the ballot. It’s called the Fatah hamas conflict happened in 2007 was big news for a few days till America had the first  black president. Gaze are victims of Hamas’ brutality AND Israel’s bombardment of civilian homes and infrastructure in Gaza, where over half the population are children, has killed hundreds of Palestinians with entire families wiped out. I think what’s important is not to equate Hamas with Palestine and not to equate the Jewish community with murderous theocrats of Israel’s far right government. 

Hamas does not represent the Palestinian cause for freedom and stay but because of the Israeli blockade, the Palestinians are dependent on Hamas for many essential goods, like medicine and water etc etc. 

Israelis need to continue to speak up against the imperialist system there is power in UNITY.

Peace, justice and reconciliation cannot be found through a mode of thinking that says only one kind of life is holy

instagram,"📷: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, left, shake hands with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in Amman, Jordan, Oct. 13, 2023. ⁠
⁠
Blinken met with King Abdullah of Jordan, who rules over a country with a large Palestinian population and has a vested interest in their status, and also with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank. ⁠
⁠
King Abdullah warned Blinken of “any attempt to forcibly displace the Palestinians from all the Palestinian Territories or to cause their internal displacement, calling for preventing a spillover of the crisis into neighboring countries and the exacerbation of the refugee issue,” Jordan’s government said in a statement. ⁠
⁠
Abdullah also stressed the need to open humanitarian corridors for medical aid and relief into Gaza while protecting civilians and working to end the escalation of the conflict. He appealed for international agencies to be allowed to work unhindered. ⁠
⁠
Blinken discussed with the king the efforts to release all the hostages the Hamas militants seized, as well as efforts to prevent the conflict from widening, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. ⁠

instagram,"Vivian Silver, 74, a member of Kibbutz Be’eri, near the northern end of Gaza, was still missing on Monday night and presumed to have been taken hostage. Ms. Silver, a native of Winnipeg, Manitoba, was among the leaders of Women Wage Peace, a large grass-roots movement founded in the aftermath of the Gaza War of 2014 to promote a political resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

She served for many years on the board of directors of B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization that said Israel was an apartheid state. She made visits to the occupied territories to express solidarity with Palestinians and volunteered with an organization that drove sick Palestinians from Gaza into Israel for medical treatment. She is the executive director of the Negev Institute for Strategies of Peace and Development and co-founded the Arab Jewish Center for Equality Empowerment and Cooperation.

One of her sons, Yonatan Zeigen, told the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz that he last communicated with her on Saturday morning, when she said she was hiding in a closet in a safe room on the kibbutz. They started to text rather than speak as the sound of shooting got closer, but there was no communication from her after 11:07 a.m., he said.

Ms. Silver is “probably worried sick about the Palestinian contacts in her phone, a friend wrote on Facebook. “She probably thinks of the danger they will now face for being seen as collaborators with the enemy.”

That peace-oriented Israelis were among Hamas’s targets has fueled further resentment of the Netanyahu government, which was caught by surprise on Saturday when Hamas fighters from the Gaza Strip streamed into Israel on Saturday, meeting little resistance.

Israel faced an unprecedented and cruel attack by Hamas, which began on a Jewish Holy Day. Over 1,300 Israelis have lost their lives, and more than 2,900 are injured. Over 150 were taken into captivity - mainly civilians. Many elderly, kids, and babies are held hostage in Gaza and now the current threat is to execute them. 
Israel is defending itself, but the conflict continues, with no end in sight.

In response, Abraham has opened its doors to host evacuee families free of charge.
We gladly host these guests and try to take care of all their needs: supportive care, employment for children, food, and more. Civil organizations started to help us and we are grateful for any contribution that comes to help.
Because we see that the situation will go on, we are starting to collect donations for hosting and caring for the families of the evacuees in Abraham. 

Your donations are essential to help those affected by the ongoing conflict.
Your support will offer help during these challenging times.

instagram,"I don’t support regimes or organizations lead by men and their narcissistic endless pursuit of power. 

I don’t support regimes or organizations influenced and manipulated by international power houses led by men and their narcissistic endless hunger for power. 

I care about people, civilians like you and me who are caught in this war of egos, this power aided by propaganda, this crossfire of power trips. 

No community should be dehumanized. 

No death, rape, body desecration of civilians is justifiable. 

No children or elder should be left vulnerable to massacre, to be the victims of a war they didn’t cause. 

No patriarchal, macho power trip against the bodies of women and girls is justifiable. 

Terrorism is condemnable. 

Powerhouses led by unscrupulous, evil, greedy men meddled in this conflict. Outsiders are also responsible for the terror. They have the blood of innocents on their hands. 

No one should be undergoing the immense trauma caused by occupation and ceaseless oppression. 

The horror of colonization is something no human should ever have to go through and yet … 

Mi gente, don’t let the  propaganda of either antisemitism or islamophobia crawl on you. 

Hateful rhetoric is planted there for a purpose and it’s easy to cave into it mindlessly. 

Those that are part of targeted diasporas know that a large community shouldn’t be punished or hated by the actions of a few. 

I have been elevating knowledgeable voices in my stories and will continue to do so. 

Palestinian and Jewish friends, I see you. I am grieving with you. 

As @valariekaur says, we need to refuse to surrender our humanity and the humanity of others.

instagram,"Please take a moment to read this thoughtful message from Anyupa Butcher
Posted @withregram • @napangarti ✨ today, I’m writing yes. Here in the NT we are only coming out of 15 years of living under the NT intervention! The damage that is left our communities in is horrible. Everything our previous generations fought for was completely torn to shreds. Our communities and what felt like our personal lives being controlled, for 15 years. I’ve lost many family members who have passed away from preventable deaths, we still have third world diseases in remote central Australia! You can only understand if you have lived it, like I have. Living on the basics card and under these punitive laws etc It impacted me as a First Nations woman and as a mother to my kids. I grew up in between the remote communities of Papunya and Yuendumu and here in Alice Springs, born and raised on Arrernte Country. I’ve spent time in cities too. Seeing the disparity between these places is unjustifiable. You have to live it to understand. I have so many personal experiences seeing and experiencing the racism, poverty and discrimination my people are faced with. Something has to change. I only started campaigning on the referendum one week ago when I made my decision. I’ve had an inner conflict for a while. But, I feel clear about my feelings, and I believe a voice to parliament is what is best for me and my kids. I’ll always have love and understanding to those who have different views. But I don’t believe the voice will divide us. The division already exists within the constitution, making laws specifically for us. Like the NT intervention. The voice will allow us to have a say on those laws so we can be empowered to better our communities. For me it’s a matter of urgency that something changes & I really hope you consider this when voting today, because so many are living in extreme circumstances. How can we protect country or be our greatest selves when there’s a pandemic of chronic illness amongst our families & many are living in third world conditions.

One worker, Rajesh Medichalmala Rajesh, is staying to support his daughter's dream of becoming a doctor. ""I have to keep my daughter's dream alive. I cannot panic and return to India. I have to earn enough for my daughter. I will work here as long as I can stay,"" he said.

Despite safety concerns, many workers choose to remain in Israel to sustain their livelihoods. An association called the Telangana Association in Israel advises workers not to rush back to India despite evacuation efforts under 'Operation Ajay.'

I needed the time to be able to navigate and process the tragedy of last Saturday as well as what is continuing to unfold.

As a woman, a mother, a Canadian, the wife of an Iranian-Canadian, a dual citizen of Iran myself, I share this not only aware of the current events unfolding but of what may come if more countries, Iran, are drawn into the conflict. That would likely mean the possible loss of life of people who are my family. For now, that’s not where we are but it lives in the heads of myself, my family and the Iranian community outside of and inside of Iran.

I am obviously not an expert, I write this as an individual, as the creator of this space and community. My ask is that your comments in response are attempt to equally as thoughtfully as what I have tried to share here.

instagram,"The children sat in the back seat of the car as their parents spoke in code.

Mya Guarnieri Jaradat and her ex-husband, Mohamed Jaradat, spoke in snippets of English and Arabic. Sensing something was amiss as they headed to the beach, their 7-year-old daughter asked what was wrong.

“There’s a war in Israel,” Mya said.

“Who are they fighting?” their daughter asked.

Mya is an American Israeli who grew up in Gainesville, Fla. Mohamed is Palestinian. For the last nine years, they have lived in Florida.

They were quiet for a moment as the little girl waited.

Finally, it was Mohamed who spoke: “The Palestinians.”

The day before, fighters from the Palestinian militant group Hamas had executed a surprise cross-border attack by land, sea and air — the deadliest attack on Israel in 50 years.

More than 1,300 Israelis and 1,900 Palestinians — including many children — have been killed since Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on Saturday and the Netanyahu government declared war in response. In Israel, Hamas gunmen killed more than 250 civilians at a music festival and took others hostage. In the Gaza Strip, residential neighborhoods were flattened beyond recognition by Israeli bombardment.

The carnage continues with no end in sight.

The conflict in the Middle East has shaped Mya and Mohamed’s lives — and love — since they met in the West Bank more than a decade before. And now, on a sunny weekend in October, that conflict had once again landed squarely on their family.

As Mya and Mohamed struggled to process this latest war, the fault lines of their relationship reappeared. Similar tense scenes have been playing out for Jewish-Palestinian couples across the U.S., where news of the war is omnipresent on computer, cellphone and television screens and in the pages of newspapers.

instagram,"""A poised and confident Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations General Assembly last month, calling out the sceptics regarding his plan for broader Arab-Israeli peace and normalisation of ties, irrespective of a resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

In his signature style, Netanyahu held up a map showing Israel in 1948, surrounded by enemies, and compared it to a new Middle East 75 years later, attributing this transformation to the success of the Abraham Accords. He proclaimed to the world that the Abraham Accords heralded the “dawn of a new age of peace.” However, only 15 days after his declaration, Israel is at war. This is why Benjamin Netanyahu is ThePrint’s #NewsmakerOfTheWeek.""

instagram,"Leading figures in the entertainment industry joined the Creative Community for Peace (CCFP) to condemn Hamas and support Israel in its ongoing conflict. High-profile signees of an open letter include Gal Gadot, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Pine, and Michael Douglas among others. The letter labels Hamas' actions as terrorism and evil, with no room for rationalization or justification.

🎬 Filmmakers Ryan Murphy, Eli Roth, and Antoine Fuqua have also lent their signatures to the letter.

🎼 Music industry veterans including music manager

For Abood Okal and his family, the nights are the worst — and each night is worse than the last.

When it grows dark, the bombing in Gaza intensifies. Sometimes there is an explosion every few minutes, close enough to make the house shake. In the morning, they feel fortunate to be alive.

Okal’s family is among a group of about 500 Americans caught in Gaza, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Following Saturday’s unprecedented attacks by Hamas, Israel has massed troops near the border with Gaza and pounded the territory with airstrikes.

“This is probably the most traumatic experience of my life,” he said. He is frightened for his wife, his child, his parents, his siblings, his extended family. He has experienced periods of violent conflict in Gaza before, but nothing like this. “I’ve never seen things on this scale,” Okal said.

instagram,"💔This was just 8 days ago.  7 days ago, we left Cairo in the morning, and brutal attacks were launched just a few hundred miles away.  The heartbreaking acts of violence and terrorism committed by Hamas have weighed heavily on us all this week, and have prevented me from posting this until now.
 
💕And yet … there was so much joy in this experience, and I DO want to document that. Desmond Tutu said, “Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness,” and I agree.
 
🙏🏼This trip … hiking in Switzerland, Oktoberfest in Germany, and seeing the pyramids and Sphinx in Egypt … was one for which I am EXTREMELY grateful.

🙏🏼🙏🏼Grateful to have seen these incredible places, full of beauty, culture, and history.

🙏🏼🙏🏼Grateful to have an incredible travel (and life) partner.  There’s truly no one in the world I’d rather do life with.

🙏🏼🙏🏼Grateful to have the financial, time, and life freedom to be able to do trips like this whenever I want.

🙏🏼🙏🏼Grateful for the physical health to be able to travel like this (3 cities, 3 hotels, 9 trains, and 29 hours of plane flights all in 8 days requires resilience!).

🙏🏼🙏🏼Grateful for being happy to come back to a home and life I love.
 
🤷🏼‍♀️(To be clear, I don’t claim to be educated enough to know “the answer” to the entire Israel/Palestine situation, and I don’t like to comment on “political” things on The Lyons’ Share.  But I know for sure that beheadings and brutal attacks on innocent citizens are abhorrent, are not political, and are condemned here.  We can all be anti-Hamas and anti-terrorism without taking a stand on the longstanding conflict).

Gerda Taro posa haciendo prácticas de tiro a las afueras de Barcelona, agosto de 1936. La famosa periodista y fotógrafa había dejado la cámara sobre la playa con el disparador automático. La foto se titula ""Un miembro de la milicia se entrena en la playa"". 

Los nuevos medios técnicos empleados tanto en la captación como en la difusión de las fotografías durante la contienda en España tuvieron un papel de suma importancia en la difusión del conflicto a nivel internacional. Esta singularidad se debe en buena medida al uso de herramientas, que si bien habían aparecido años atrás, aquí se perfeccionaron y combinaron dando pie a perspectivas y procedimientos de trabajo novedosos. 

La finalidad de esta tecnología era atender los requerimientos de la creciente maquinaria mediática en varios ámbitos: agilizar los procesos de producción de noticias, facilitar la inmersión del reportero en el lugar de los hechos, privilegiar el protagonismo informativo de las imágenes y alcanzar una cobertura mundial de los acontecimientos. Los avances fueron numerosos: reducción del tamaño de las cámaras, simplificando y agilizando su manejo; desarrollo de objetivos más luminosos y de diversas distancias focales, fabricación de emulsiones fotográficas más sensibles que permitieran captar situaciones en condiciones de luz adversas y la creación de películas de grano fino para su duplicación.

Gerda Taro poses doing shooting practice on the outskirts of Barcelona, ​​August 1936. 

The famous journalist and photographer had left the camera on the beach with the automatic shutter. The photo is titled ""A militia member trains on the beach."" The new technical means used both in capturing and disseminating photographs during the conflict in Spain played a very important role in the dissemination of the conflict internationally. This uniqueness is largely due to the use of tools, which, although they had appeared years ago, were perfected and combined here, giving rise to new perspectives and work procedures.

instagram,"As news began to seep out of Israel of an unprecedented massacre of civilians by Hamas, it was immediately clear to European diplomats that this could herald a new major conflict in the Middle East, writes Naomi O'Learly. 

At a time when many observant Jewish people around the world had not yet heard the news because their phones were turned off for the Sabbath, calls began pinging between the capitals of the 27 European Union countries on Saturday morning to co-ordinate a response.

To anyone familiar with the conflict it was a given that Israel would respond to the attack with massive air strikes on Gaza. By the time people were having their breakfast in Ireland on Saturday the bombing had already begun.

Israeli air strikes flattened the Al-Sousi Mosque and a high-rise residential building in densely-populated Gaza city on early Saturday, video suggests. Médecins Sans Frontières reported that a hit on a hospital had killed an ambulance driver and a nurse. Large numbers of wounded people began arriving at hospitals. Unable to leave due to the narrow strip’s sealed borders, frightened residents began emptying out supermarkets to stock up on food.

“We are at war,” Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu declared. He announced a mass call-up of army reservists “to fight back on a scale and intensity that the enemy has so far not experienced”. It was an indication of a potential ground war.

In the aftermath, either due to a distorted rumour or a deliberate attempt to discredit those seen as “soft on Palestine”, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Denmark were named in an incorrect Israeli media report as having refused to describe Hamas as a terror group. They all publicly denied it – but not before the damaging claim went viral.

“Look, if there would be more difficulties at the regional level, we would have immediately huge difficulties on the European soil because of the refugees,” EU Council President Michel said in an interview with The Associated Press.

“And we know how it can be used by some political groups within the EU to fuel some controversies and to make the EU more fragmented,” he said, adding it could increase polarization on one of the most contentious issues in many European nations.

“We know that in our societies across the EU, there are also different feelings, emotions among our citizens, and this is very important not to import within the EU the tragic conflict,” he said.

instagram,"In the spring of 1949, foreign ministers from Canada, the United States, and Western Europe met in Washington D.C. to sign the North Atlantic Treaty. Many thought the treaty, which effectively created the military alliance known as NATO, would not last, with The Washington Post writing that the signing ceremony was “more spectacular than the act itself.”⁠
⁠
One person who did not share this sentiment was Norman Angell, a British journalist and politician who believed it was only a matter of time before humanity would say goodbye to war forever. In his 1909 book The Great Illusion, Angell argued that developed countries were becoming so economically dependent on each other that the costs of international conflict far outweighed its gains.⁠
⁠
Sadly, his prediction was proven wrong by the outbreak of World War I five years later, and again by that of World War II in 1939. Angell hoped the North Atlantic Treaty, replacing previous attempts at unification like Woodrow Wilson’s League of Nations, would finally create the stabilized world order he had spent the better part of his career writing about. But did it?⁠

Please join us in a shared prayer for Israel from the Office of the Chief Rabbi. 🕯️ 

“Our Father in Heaven, Rock and Redeemer of Israel. 
We come before You in prayer and supplication, 
stunned and heartbroken by the merciless atrocities carried out against our beloved State of Israel and its People, 
turning the Festival of our Rejoicing into a day of our suffering. 

We mourn the loss of many hundreds of women, men and children
brutally murdered in these attacks and pray for their souls.

We pray for the speedy recovery of the thousands who are injured. 

And may the Holy One, blessed be He, 
have compassion on those who are being held hostage and enable them to emerge from the darkness of the shadow of death to their freedom;
may He break their bonds,
deliver them from distress,
and bring them swiftly home to their families’ embrace.

Almighty God, 
protect the families of Israel from the threat of terror
and give strength to the soldiers of the Israel Defence Forces,
whose lives are in danger as they confront our enemies.

Put into the hearts and minds of Israel’s political and military leaders
the wisdom to make the right decisions to bring this conflict to a swift and successful conclusion,
so that innocent civilians can resume their lives without the fear and threat of attack.

Spread over the inhabitants of Your land the tabernacle of Your peace, as it is written:

‘I will grant peace in the Land;
you will lie down and none shall make you afraid.
And the sword will not pass through your land.’

May You, Almighty God,
bless us all with security and tranquillity
and grant a true, just and lasting peace in our Holy Land and across the entire world.

‘May He who makes peace in high places, bring peace for us and for all the people of Israel.’ “

Amen. 🙏

instagram,"During my stay in Israel and visiting Gaza, I had the opportunity to visit the Dome of the Rock and the Temple Mount. It became abundantly clear that this spot holds unparalleled significance for three of the major modern-day religions: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The historical and religious importance of this place, coupled with its contested nature, serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities of the Middle East conflict.

The coexistence of these three religions in such a confined space has historically been a source of tension. While each faith has its own deep-rooted connection to the site, it also brings the potential for clashes and disputes. It became evident that achieving lasting peace in the Middle East would be an intricate challenge, given the sacredness of the Dome of the Rock and the Temple Mount to all three faiths.

Yet, my visit also shed light on another troubling aspect of the region. I could not ignore the harsh reality of apartheid-like conditions prevailing in Gaza, where the Palestinian people are enduring immense suffering. Witnessing this situation prompted me to delve into extensive research to better understand the region and its multifaceted conflicts.

As I delved deeper into my studies and conversations with people from various backgrounds, I couldn't help but draw parallels between the plight of the Palestinian people and that of so many Black communities around the world. The shared experiences of discrimination, marginalization, and the struggle for basic human rights resonated across these different contexts.

My time in Israel and Gaza served as a catalyst for my ongoing exploration of the Middle East's complexities and the enduring quest for peace. The importance of the Dome of the Rock and the Temple Mount to three major religions underscores the intricacies of the region's conflicts. Simultaneously, the alarming conditions in Gaza highlighted the urgent need for a just and equitable resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It is crucial to recognize that, despite geographical and cultural differences, the struggle for equality and justice unites people facing oppression around the world. #freepalestine",,261,"{'like_count': 254, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 3927}",Fufu,,2023-10-14 20:41:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/19623488_1472153369511950_8683962373981077504_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JfPb0EMZ8U0AX99tTGz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAJwfX_XJtmxHGEblmPc4JiJT3MZqd7E-hpIPEe6LVF3A&oe=655AE2C6,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZJwSCvZoE/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391434440_3511067062467092_1528431736348600596_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=oX8XPkBr0sQAX-K33HA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAp6v4iyNmOFbgubjDgI-SMZxTFzqeirAi1KaO1tKVzTw&oe=65416736

instagram,"In the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, the Israeli military reported on a Saturday that it had detected a ""significant movement"" to the south of Palestinian civilian areas. This followed a directive from Israeli authorities the previous day, instructing residents of Gaza City to evacuate. Israel's Prime Minister also pledged further retaliation in response to what he referred to as Hamas' recent rampage.

On the international front, U.S. President Joe Biden confirmed that consultations were underway with regional governments to address the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Trapped Palestinians in the region have been enduring a severe power blackout and shortages of essential supplies like food and water, exacerbated by intense Israeli airstrikes.

The root of this recent escalation lies in a deadly attack by Hamas a week earlier, where its fighters targeted Israelis, resulting in the tragic deaths of 1,300 individuals, primarily civilians. Furthermore, they seized numerous hostages during the incident.

In response, Israel has imposed a total blockade on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which is home to approximately 2.3 million Palestinians. The region has faced unprecedented aerial bombardment from the Israeli military, causing significant casualties. Gaza authorities have reported the loss of around 1,900 lives as a result of this recent conflict.

This situation continues to evolve, and international efforts are being made to address the escalating tensions and the dire humanitarian situation in the region.

instagram,"""I have what some might refer to as an overactive imagination.⁠
⁠
As a kid, I would fill black and white marble composition books with made-up stories and scenarios that would dance through my head. As a teenager, I would put pen to paper and fantasize about the life I might actually live as an adult.⁠
⁠
This overactive imagination—this innate ability to create stories and explore endless possibilities—has served me well in life. Mostly.⁠
⁠
Telling stories is my job. And while these days I tend to stick to honest, real-life, sometimes uncomfortable ones, both past and present, that hasn’t stopped my brain from continuing to create made-up stories in my mind.⁠
⁠
Sometimes it's simply my overactive imagination making an unexpected, innocent appearance. Other times, it’s my anxiety—my desperate, relentless need to overthink a situation—finding a way to sabotage me.⁠
⁠
And this is especially true when it comes to relationships..."" 🗒️❤️🤯 ~ Nicole Cameron⁠

instagram,"For the past week, news from Israel and Gaza has been distressing.⁣
⁣
When news events like conflict, natural disasters, pandemics and other tragedies reach our screens, it can cause a lot of anxiety and even a sense of hopelessness.⁣
⁣
For people living with dementia, the constant stream of images on the news may cause additional worry and feel overwhelming – perhaps because it brings back personal memories of their own distressing experiences, such as living through previous times of conflict or tragedy.⁣
⁣
We can’t make the news go away, but we do have some tips for dealing with it.⁣
⁣
The 24-hour news cycle can make it difficult to switch off, so try to limit how much you read, watch or listen to.⁣
⁣
Take care of your mental health. If you or someone you support is struggling with stress or anxiety that is affecting your ability to function properly, or you are feeling very low, then contact your GP for help. Or call our Dementia support line if you are lonely or afraid and need a chat.⁣
⁣
Understand a person may be 'time-shifting; and their experience may be that they are living at an earlier time in their life. They may become disorientated and confused about time and place. Try to accept the reality of the person with dementia, listen to them, and try to understand their past.⁣

instagram,"I made this Star of David for my wife a few years ago. Today, I watched her take it off when she left the house because she is scared. We wanted to go to the synagogue, but instead we live-streamed it because she was scared. They had armed security there because they are scared. 

I am no oppressed minority, My beliefs are secular, and I am as privileged as the next white guy. This is the first time I have experienced a fear of simply existing. Do not give me any sympathy, I do not need it. I just want to say that for many, a jewish existence is one that is full of fear right now. 

I am not here to tell you what to believe, or think. My perspective is one from privilege just seeing a tiny window of something else through my wife, my family. 

I will not tell any Jew, or Palestinian what they should think or do, But I will tell others who are in a place similar to me (white, housed, tax paying thus Israel supporting like it or not, civilian who has never experienced war, leftist, socialist, feminist, now I am just virtue signaling like the rest…) that if you know someone who is attached to this conflict, give them love, give them space, and muster up as much empathy as you can. While I do not have any close Palestinian friends that confide in me, I am sure many of their experiences (here in the states) are similar, an existence shadowed with fear. 

If you want a statement from me about the bigger issues, I don’t really have one and I am not nearly educated enough to debate or pretend I actually understand anything at all. I guess just go up to a mirror, and pull back your lips, you have bones sticking out through your damn skin.

The use of force is unacceptable, and direct dialogue is of important significance for the resolution of this long lasting conflict.”
The State Department also said that “the US supports the Armenian government’s efforts to help the displaced find shelter and comfort in Armenia in close cooperation with humanitarian organizations. We express our empathy to the displaced persons, realizing the shock and trauma they are going through, and what uncertainty they are facing.”
The US State Department added that “Azerbaijan also bears responsibility for its armed forces to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, which regulates military operations, protection of peaceful civilians and humanitarian treatment against combatants.”",,214,"{'like_count': 198, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 34922}",Akoonk Media,,2023-10-14 17:51:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/353978286_711794234047743_4590842855985201445_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=dpoMfdxlmjIAX9U6Lu1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCmzKCwv-YZPx9qfkVN2BIDBFKq6aR22DGmRFVROAEdkA&oe=655B723D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyY2Uc0oluj/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390974347_1761253057632019_4118491894411544282_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=azH9I_4nIfQAX8YKew-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA6Ls-aO9VoENbO29C-GKyhvIOGOLVblENYdtep3yVFew&oe=6534AF20
instagram,"The Israeli–Lebanese conflict, or the South Lebanon conflict was a series of clashes involving Israel, Lebanon, Syria,and the Palestinians. The Palestinian Liberation Organization rebel group was known to recruit Palestinian refugees in Lebanon who had been expelled or fled after the creation of Israel in 1948. In the 1970s, the PLO established a base in Southern Lebanon, resulting in an increase of internal, cross-border violence and tensions regarding the refugee population demographic changes. Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon pushed the PLO north of the Litani River, but the rebels continued their campaign against Israel. Israel formed an alliance with Lebanese Christian militias and forcibly expelled the PLO and established a pro Israel puppet state called the free Lebanon state. In 1985, Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shia Muslim militant movement sponsored by Iran, called for an end to the Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory which they eventually did in 2000s

instagram,"The Solar Eclipse on October 14 at 10:55 AM PT is at 21˚ Libra 07˚ 9"". It shows us the polarities in our relationships. Conflict leads to revolution, and sometimes it can be necessary for the growth of a relationship. However, we could say things in the heat of a moment that we can’t take back. The truth comes out, and sometimes that truth is hard to hear.

We could question our relationships and reach a deciding point about troubling connections. Make-ups and break-ups.

Venus is in a sextile aspect to Mars and a separating opposition to Saturn. Mars in Scorpio is in a trine aspect to Saturn, indicating this lunation could draw us into contemplation about our relationships and boundaries with all areas of our lives. We understand our deep passion and desire.

The Sabian Symbol for the 21st–22nd degree is:

A child giving birds a drink at a fountain. 

We crave connection and care. The innocent part of us wants to care for all creatures, honor nature, and bring a child's curiosity into how we participate in life on Earth.

The delay and search for a distributor come amidst concerns from some record industry executives. These concerns are particularly due to Kanye's previous antisemitic comments and the current conflict between Israel and Hamas.

instagram,"Members of the Jewish community in Chicago gathered near Belmont Harbor on Thursday to honor Palestinians and Israelis killed in the ongoing conflict.

The mourner’s Kaddish, a Jewish prayer typically spoken during the mourning period after the death of a loved one, was recited by members affiliated with the group IfNotNow, a national Jewish organization that advocates for the end of the Israeli government’s presence in Gaza and the West Bank.

“We are here to grieve for the innocent Israelis, including children, who were killed by Hamas,” Elie Katzman-Jacobson of IfNotNow told those gathered. “We are here to grieve for the innocent Palestinians, including children, who have been killed by the Israeli Defense Force.”

Candles were lit in memory of those killed, and attendees sang prayers for those still missing and for peace in the region. Organizers also read part of a poem by Palestinian American poet Suheir Hammad.

Hamas’ surprise attack on Saturday killed more than 1,300 people in Israel, including 222 soldiers — a toll unseen in Israel for decades — and the ensuing Israeli bombardment has killed more than 1,400 people in Gaza, according to authorities on both sides. Israel says roughly 1,500 Hamas militants were killed inside Israel, and that hundreds of the dead in Gaza are Hamas members.

Gaza’s interior ministry on Thursday said that an Israeli airstrike on a residential building in the densely populated Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza has killed at least 45 people and wounded dozens more.

Eli Newell, who is also with IfNotNow, said people should remember that every person killed had their own story and were someone’s loved one.

“Children, teachers, doctors, artists, neighbors and so much more,” Newell said. “All lives lost too soon.”

Newell added that this isn’t the first time that blood has been spilled in the region. He said the only way to end the conflict is for the Israeli government to come up with a solution that works for all parties.

It’s a conflict between downstate people against upstate people.

It’s well-known that Jewish people have a strong tradition of valuing education and striving for success, leading to numerous accomplishments in fields like sales, medicine, law, and beyond, across every state and country.

It becomes evident that Jewish influence often underlies these achievements, evoking admiration or mixed feelings.

Moreover, the Jewish community has indelibly shaped the world of technology and innovation, driving global progress and emphasizing diversity’s importance in knowledge and innovation.

Despite the widespread negativity and hostility we encounter globally, this burden only strengthens our resolve.

In the face of adversity, Israel stands as a symbol of unity, where religious and secular individuals come together to celebrate Shabbat and important Jewish holidays, reaffirming our shared heritage.

Jewish people, known for their resilience, have endured unimaginable suffering, especially during the Holocaust, but our strength prevails. Violence cannot halt our progress; we remain unstoppable.

You cannot suppress the brilliance within the Jewish community, nor stifle our intellectual prowess. We’ve a history of resilience and determination, a testament to our enduring capacity for brilliance.

In these times, our community unites, fortifying our bonds and reaffirming our deep sense of togetherness.

Our love for our people is profound; one loss is a loss for all, underscoring our unwavering unity. We are a resilient people, and we will endure.”",,192,"{'like_count': 188, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 14443}",Batya Comunale,,2023-10-14 09:54:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/315014900_156508513808876_961883215153272120_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=rfSji6WT_iEAX9-xL7-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDHIWf6oAFaGmEoN6IfYpBP5pF4ZEXHyCd0RDYvcQ8rpQ&oe=655AADAA,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyX_uw2upka/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390952221_1489512648462525_970834782915224358_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=6NVp7DHa1v0AX_JpIDQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDA_Uvqs9TOZJE1HvAiIXgzbzrMmMDNwyLVWH6tT0xB1Q&oe=653B6055

instagram,"Nearly empty old Jerusalem, many shops remain closed. When asked about peoples views on Israel’s planned ground offensive in Gaza we receive cautious answers “It doesn’t matter what we say, everything can be misinterpreted. So why even comment?”, one man tells us, a Palestinian citizen of Israel.

There are more questions than answers in any war - what makes this one so complex: nobody knows how the violence will expand beyond Israel and Gaza.

instagram,"Thousands of protesters poured onto the streets of central London on Saturday to demand that Israel halt its bombing campaign and siege of the Gaza Strip as it prepares for a possible ground invasion of the tiny Palestinian enclave.

Undeterred by warnings against waving the Palestinian flag, the protesters gathered outside the BBC’s New Broadcasting House to denounce what they called “Israeli agression”, as air strikes pounded the Gaza Strip for an eighth successive day.

Earlier on Saturday, the exterior of BBC studios in London was sprayed with red paint in protest against the channel’s coverage of the conflict. Middle East Eye contacted the BBC for comment but did not receive a response by time of publication.

At the rally - organised by Friends of Al-Aqsa, Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) and other groups - pro-Palestinian protesters could be heard chanting “Israel is a terrorist state” and “free Palestine” as they moved from Regent Street, one of London’s main shopping thoroughfares, towards Westminster.

More than 1,000 police were deployed ahead of the protest, with the Metropolitan police warning that anyone showing support for Hamas, a group proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK, or deviating from the protest route could face arrest.

But I don’t think Israel has to make Gaza a “tent city” they will be in the wrong for that. So many lives will be lost. 

The UN and world leadership should call for peace and bring Palestine leadership - Hamas and Israel leadership to the table and resolve this like adults and through dialogue.

instagram,"Conflict can be tough but handled well it can increase connection and build your relationship. 

How you communicate is important. 

👉 Start the conversation with a soft tone. 

👉 Affirm your commitment to the relationship and desire to address problems in a way that is good for both of you. 

👉 Avoid blaming, accusing, or name calling. 

👉 Humility can soften your partner.  Be the first to express where you believe you may be wrong.

These and many other communication approaches can help but you’ve likely seen that once one of you is hurt, pissed off, or scared that even the most perfect communication has little effect. 

Learning to manage and regulate your own emotions is the key to improving the conflict in your relationship. 

Without staying emotionally grounded you won’t be able to communicate well and will struggle to receive what your partner says. 

If you’d like help in this area check out the link in my bio. 

You’ll learn the science behind how to stay emotionally grounded in the midst of conflict and why on a neurological level this is crucial for navigating conflict well.

instagram,"A bitter row is brewing within the family of the late renowned businessman and architect Peter Kamya who owned Simbamanyo Estates Ltd and Afrique Suites in Mutungo.

Kamya passed away in December last year, but since then, his family has been entangled in a major dispute over his estate.

At the heart of the conflict are the late Kamya’s widow, Dr. Margaret Muganwa, and the children that the tycoon left behind.

Dr Muganwa is a sister to former Deputy Prime Minister Henry Muganwa Kajura.

Although at the time of his passing, it was reported by the widow that Kamya left behind only five children, it has now been established that the correct number is 17.

It is also understood that Dr Muganwa is contesting the paternity of 12 of the 17 children and has since demanded DNA tests to be carried out.

The ongoing family feud over the properties, however, recently took a turn after the widow, Dr Muganwa was granted a certificate of no objection, in effect giving her total control over the Kamya estate.

A source tells this reporter that tension has since spiked as the family prepares for the final rites at Kamya's ancestral home, where the issue of the property allocation is expected to take center stage.

“The 17 children, who had previously supported the widow, are now resolute in their pursuit of a fair and equitable distribution of their father’s estate,” the source said.

instagram,"The situation in Gaza is getting worse. Today's morning the Israeli forces forced 1.1 million civilians to evacuate immediately to the south of gaza. Couple of hours later they targeted these exact civilians while on their way to safety. It was a trick to gather as many families as possible and wipe them out. 
evacuating 1.1m people only to bombard them is ethnic cleansing. 

this isn't a 'complicated conflict,' it isn't a situation that 'requires nuance,' it's not a 'geopolitical event' that requires us to condemn the 'bad actors' on 'both sides.' 

it's a genocide.

instagram,"A group of faculty members and students spoke about the history of and ongoing conflict in Palestine at a Thursday event sponsored by Duke Students for Justice in Palestine, the Department of Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies and the International Comparative Studies program.

The Pause for Palestine event’s speakers included Frances Hasso, professor of gender, sexuality and feminist studies and Jessica Namakkal, associate professor of the practice of international comparative studies, gender, sexuality and feminist studies and history. Two students who wished to remain anonymous, a sophomore and a second-year master’s international student from Palestine, also spoke. The professors later gave attendees a chance to hold an open conversation.

“I know it can be really hard in the classroom, when you feel like you are outnumbered,” Namakkal said. “... One of the reasons we decided we needed to do this immediately was so you could see the other faces in this room and say, ’Actually, we’re not alone.’”

The sophomore speaker, who is originally from Palestine but was raised in the United States, shared a prepared speech to an audience of around 50 people.
They acknowledged how “incredibly overwhelmed, anxious and stressed” they have felt in recent days about the developments in Palestine.

The student began writing their speech after returning from a rally for Palestine held Sunday in downtown Raleigh. They said that while they normally feel “motivated and excited” to continue their activism for Palestine after rallies, they felt “absolutely hopeless and drained” afterward.

“I feel drained from the constant fight to defend my identity, to prove that my people are worthy of human dignity,” they said. “I’m drained from being anxious about having to attend class at a pro-Zionist university, from receiving threats from my peers who harass anyone who utters a single criticism of Zionism.”

With the large scale deployment of over 300,000 reservists with supporting tanks, artillery positions and support by the Israeli Air Force and Israeli Navy - the IDF has laid siege to the Gaza Strip. Having pummeled Gaza City with continuous airstrikes intended for militant targets, there have been over 1,900 Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip and whole blocks of the city having been destroyed.

It’s continuation of the decades-long Arab/Palestinian-Israeli conflict which began in November 1947 / May 15th, 1948 when the British Mandate of Palestine had expired and the State of Israel declared its independence, then fighting against all its neighboring countries in over a year of large scale war, the First Arab-Israeli War ended with ceasefires by July 1949. Numerous wars continued to involve the Israeli Defense Forces fighting against Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon.

The Arab-Israeli conflict has been ongoing for decades, through many wars with political tensions and border disputes between various Arab countries and the State of Israel, during the mid- to late-20th century in the Levant.

Background: “She’s my wife. I can speak to her however I want.”

 (while testifying at our Protective Order Hearing- PO was granted) 

Through this campaign, it is our goal to educate family court professionals on the reality of post separation abuse. If you are a family court professional, we ask that you:

Imagine yourself in the shoes of a survivor.

Imagine believing you did the right thing in leaving an abusive relationship.

Imagine discovering a new, often more painful form of abuse: post separation abuse.

Imagine your child being used as a pawn for the sole purpose of hurting you.

Imagine being unable to protect your child and if you try, you are reprimanded and punished. Imagine being labeled as “high conflict” when you are simply desperate to protect your child. 
Imagine the system that you thought would protect you, failing you.
 
Imagine getting messages like this every day, the attacks are pervasive and unrelenting, affecting every part of your life: your job, your mental health, your cognitive functioning, your emotional state, and your ability to parent.
 
We don’t have to imagine; this is our life.

If this is a war, as both sides agree it is, then Hamas’s deliberate targeting of civilians counts as a major war crime.

But the brutality demonstrated by Hamas did not emerge in a vacuum. The lesson of what is currently happening in Israel and Gaza is that violence breeds more violence.

The last real chance of avoiding the tragic conflict between Israel and Hamas was destroyed by a single killing: The assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995.

instagram,"""Alakazam's Lament""

After his many versions disappeared, Alakazam sat exhausted. ""What's the matter? You seem weary,"" the sorcerer's student said. ""In manifesting realities with consciousness, one encounters in existence the multitudes of other consciousnesses manifesting within reality. Not all of these are positive,"" the sorcerer said.
As the student pondered this, he noticed energies pouring out of and into Alakazam. The light coming in was soft and warm, however the energies coming out of the sorcerer looked like severed tendrils. The student looked upon his mentor and realized the life of a sorcerer was not an easy one. There was both pain and reward .

""I am tired!"" The sorcerer yelled. ""The path of a sorcerer is to acquire knowledge, so we can manifest harmony. Never use what you've learned to harm others!  I am tired of seeing all the fighting and discord in this existence!"" The apprentice stood dazed, never seeing their teacher so frustrated. ""It begins on the individual level. You must learn to love yourself before you love others. There's so much hate in this world between friends, communities, nations. The reason we acquire knowledge is to understand each other and achieve harmony for all souls. I've been a peaceful warrior for so long, had so much of my energy lost to preventing conflict, and am tired."" 

The sorcerer's apprentice approached him, and beautifully understanding that his teacher was both powerful, & yet still wholly human, the student approached his teacher with tears in his eyes. ""Master, you are not alone,"" said the student. ""I am with you, and don't ever forget the light will always connect to the greater light."" Acknowledging his student, the teacher stood wiping his tears of sadness away. Placing his hands onto the apprentice's shoulders, the man that was a sorcerer looked into his students eyes, the Great & The Terrible & the Human Being. ""You have listened to everything I've said and brought me hope. I feel now, because you believe in pursuing knowledge & harmony this world can be healed. Thank you my dear friend.""",,127,"{'like_count': 120, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 8241}",T.j.

I have been thinking about the years I spent in rooms at the UN listening to people talk about this conflict, the maps, the plans, the agreements, the sincere pleas of regular people and the bad faith pronouncements of politicians, and I've thought about the stories my father told me growing up of picking grapefruits as a young man in the 1960s in the orchards of Kibbutz Magen, and the story I read this week of a man fleeing his home in Gaza with the family's pet goldfish stashed in a plastic jar of water. The reine claude plums are still in the markets, and I liked the look of these three on the plate, so I painted them. It's still wet, so please excuse the shine.

instagram,"Editors' Note:
Corrections have been made to this article surrounding terminology used when describing the Israeli Defense Forces’ bombings of Palestinian civilians, including in Gaza, as well as the removal of a UO Fraternity and Sorority Life organization that was previously mentioned in the report. The organization was not involved with the publication of the article. The Emerald also mistakenly quoted Alpha Epsilon Pi’s national chapter as opposed to the UO chapter.

The Emerald is working to cover updates on the conflict as it relates to the University of Oregon and to clarify language used in previous reports. This is a sensitive topic and it deserves to be covered delicately. We are keeping the updated article on our website for transparency and as a reminder to hold ourselves accountable moving forward.
We intended our initial article to be a breaking news report on the vigil on Oct. 9 held at UO by Oregon Hillel, as well as a gathering of initial reactions to the attack in Israel.

In doing so, we made several mistakes. We rushed out an article that relied heavily on social media statements and failed to bring in an array of student voices and perspectives. Instead, we covered more background on statements made by government officials unaffiliated with the Oregon Hillel vigil, as well as an overly brief background on a conflict with a long history behind it. We should have interviewed a wider variety of voices before the publishing of this article.

As an independent student media organization, our job is not to take political stances on specific issues, but instead to report the facts as they happen — fairly and accurately. Part of that means providing a thorough look at all sides of an issue. We regret that we failed to do this, and we are working to provide a more comprehensive perspective from all points of view.

The Emerald regrets these errors.",,116,"{'like_count': 112, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 4295}",Daily Emerald,,2023-10-14 01:24:37,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/64219644_319634828942825_7850975354075217920_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=h3WiFRWOl3QAX-DXFDd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB6QjVCzTewwRLy3m_ZZTA9TcJky9WtS_DL9JVgr4XOWg&oe=6559D41F,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyXFXgprqhi/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391240582_294579356841626_1034901952483500124_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=G3U-Q4YQdZUAX-6rN5J&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDo9WIVMtGywEvf97yBLmwaCZrDRoisQ3w5ah5zX9SRhw&oe=65535F58

Absolutely. 
The loss of innocent civilian lives is deplorable in any circumstance.  And I’ll say it again (because everyone likes to say “whatabout”)—that includes the loss of Palestinian lives before and after this conflict. 

Supposed liberals and free-thinkers are rushing to defend Hamas. In essence, rushing to defend the slaughter of 1,000 Jewish people. Their immediate reaction is to say “what about what Israel did?” 

I’ll repeat this again here. Many people are conflating EXPLANATION with JUSTIFICATION (or excuse). Explanation is the reason WHY Hamas did what it did—the oppressive Israeli regime, mistreatment and murder by Israeli soldiers, and so on. I grok the “why.” I denounce what Israel has been doing. I understand the motive. 

However, people think that because there is a reason (explanation) for Hamas’ act that it is somehow justified (that it is morally right or reasonable). This line is so absolutely clear, and I am baffled why people are so confused by this. TERRORISM IS WRONG. MURDERING INNOCENT CIVILIANS IS NEVER JUSTIFIED (by any side). Why is anyone trying to excuse or justify murdering 1000 civilians?!?! Is everyone on crazy pills?!?! 

For example, if a guy murdered my family, am I justified in murdering his family?  I mean, you know why I did it. You have the “explanation,” right?  I was angry. But was it “justified?” Was I morally right to slaughter innocent people related to him?  Learn the difference. 

See comments section to finish this. Let me fumigate more wisdom here. 🤓

instagram,"Iran heeft op zaterdag een bericht naar Israël gestuurd waarin benadrukt wordt dat het verdere escalatie in de oorlog tussen Hamas en Israël niet wil, maar dat het zal moeten ingrijpen als de Israëlische operatie in Gaza doorgaat, zo meldden twee diplomatieke bronnen met kennis van de situatie aan Axios.

Waarom het belangrijk is: Als Iran zich direct of indirect, bijvoorbeeld via een militante groep in Syrië of door elke beslissing van Hezbollah om volledig deel te nemen aan de strijd, in het conflict mengt, zal het gevecht tussen Hamas en Israël uitmonden in een regionale oorlog.

Het bericht van Iran, verstuurd naar Israël via de VN, komt op een moment waarop de regering-Biden heeft geprobeerd om Iran en door Iran gesteunde Hezbollah uit Libanon af te schrikken om deel te nemen aan de oorlog. Deze week stuurde de VS een vliegdekschipgroep en gevechtsvliegtuigen naar de regio.

instagram,"#RayverCruz saw #JulieAnneSanJose as a strong foundation of hope when they were locked down in Israel following the militant Hamas forces attack on the country on Oct. 8. 

In an interview on Fast Talk with Boy Abunda, the couple shared their experience of having been caught in the crossfire of the Israel-Hamas war along with GMA artist Boobay after they went to the country for their trio concert ""Luv Trip Na, Laff Trip Pa,"" which was supposed to be held at the Smolarz Auditorium at the Tel Aviv University.

They have since arrived safely to the Philippines on Oct. 9.

According to Julie, they had absolutely no idea about the conflict that was happening in the country, ""Nung pagkalapag pa lang namin ng Israel, nilibot na namin. Sobrang excited kami na mag-ikot and to visit different places.""

""Ang bilis ng pangyayari,"" both Julie and Rayver said as they recalled the time when the bombing started on the morning of Oct. 7.

""Hindi alam [ng mga managers namin] kung paano nila kami gigisingin in a way na sabihin samin na kailangan na naming bumangon kasi may gyera na,"" Rayver recounted.

The two of them explained that the place they were staying at had a bomb shelter, and a siren would sound off to signal them that they had to rush to the bunker within one minute as the bomb would drop within 90 seconds.

Rayver shared that there was an instance where the lights of the building they were in began to shake because of how close the third bombing was to them.

When asked if the actor ever thought about proposing to Julie during those life-threatening moments, Rayver said that he was already one with her ""mind, body, and soul.""

""Nung time ng pangatlong pagsabog at pagpasok, para sa akin, everything happens for a reason. Siya lang ang nakakaalam, yung sa Itaas,"" he said.

""Para sa akin, yung glimmer of hope, yung lakas ng loob ko, nanggagaling kay Julie. So iniisip ko, may rason kung bakit si Julie magkasama kami sa Holy Land. And then for me, mind, body, and soul, kasal na ako sa kanya,"" he continued.

instagram,"Do you fight fair in your relationship? 

These are just a few tips to consider next time you get in conflict with your partner. 

🪩 Don’t bring up the past! 
It might be tempting to bring up all the issues of the past but don’t do it. It’s overwhelming and you lose sight of what you were fighting about in the first place. 

🪩Take a break. 
Learning how to take a break to self-regulate is helpful to strip a fight from escalating. Coming back to the topic is important when you feel you can talk through it.

🪩 Don’t hit below the belt. 
Don’t be mean or say things you wish you didn’t say later on. Words hurt and it doesn’t help your relationship thrive in or out of a fight. 

🪩 Don’t fight to win. 
Fighting to win or be right gets you nowhere and disconnects you from your partner. Be partners not enemies.

instagram,"Biden made it a point to say the laws of war should be observed and Israel needn’t unnecessarily target civilians. He also urged Netanyahu via phone call to take pains to minimize Palestinian casualties.

Yet, Israeli forces continue to target the press and innocent civilians including over 600 children. The Palestinian death toll is now at 2,000. 

This morning on NPR, reporters on the ground in Israel stated there were no signs that Israel forces would relent anytime soon.

Ben Rhodes was a national security official in President Barack Obama's administration posted on X: “The decisions being made now are going to impact millions of lives, reverberate for generations, and risk all kinds of escalation. The U.S. should have learned from 9/11 the profound cost of being guided by anger and fear. I hope that is what we are telling the Israeli government.”

During a news conference in Qatar today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: “We continue to discuss with Israel the importance of taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians. We recognize that many Palestinian families in Gaza are suffering through no fault of their own and that Palestinian civilians have lost their lives.”

Current and former U.S. officials have been trying to deescalate but it may be too late especially as the U.S. vehemently showed unequivocal solidarity with Israel early into the conflict and provided them the world’s largest warship among other resources. A former U.S. official stated: “We’re trying to convince them [the Israelis], but emotions are running high.”

If the Israeli government continues this way, what moral high ground will they stand on?",,94,"{'like_count': 91, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 12051}",Jeanette Padilla,,2023-10-14 04:44:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/337302310_1378704359639370_1863869922731520124_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=PslxdluVhpEAX9aC3Lg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDOnFQojZf8MnJKEnt4LCkN7S7e8BlTDqg_kxM7LxAysw&oe=655BA8F0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyXcSQFOnt3/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391208076_6770459013010051_4968254810752036105_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4cYKBiLoTxAAX_-Bh4E&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfConJjxUl3cSiQ9JJWB1omi_2wrYCNnPPM05WP-4OLa2A&oe=6537D5C6
instagram,"Nakba.. 
75 years of persecution of the Palestinian people by Jews- Israeli settlers since 1948. 
According to United Nation, The Nakba, which means “catastrophe” in Arabic, refers to the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Before the Nakba, Palestine was a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society. However, the conflict between Arabs and Jews intensified in the 1930s with the increase of Jewish immigration, driven by persecution in Europe, and with the Zionist movement aiming to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.

In November 1947, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution partitioning Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with Jerusalem under a UN administration. The Arab world rejected the plan, arguing that it was unfair and violated the UN Charter. Jewish militias launched attacks against Palestinian villages, forcing thousands to flee. The situation escalated into a full-blown war in 1948, with the end of the British Mandate and the departure of British forces, the declaration of independence of the State of Israel and the entry of neighbouring Arab armies. The newly established Israeli forces launched a major offensive. The result of the war was the permanent displacement of more than half of the Palestinian population.

As early as December 1948, the UN General Assembly called for refugee return, property restitution and compensation (resolution 194 (II)). However, 75 years later, despite countless UN resolutions, the rights of the Palestinians continue to be denied. According to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) more than 5 million Palestine refugees are scattered throughout the Middle East.  Today, Palestinians continue to be dispossessed and displaced by Israeli settlements, evictions, land confiscation and home demolitions. The Nakba anniversary is a reminder not only of those tragic events of 1948, but of the ongoing injustice suffered by the Palestinians. The Nakba had a profound impact on the Palestinian people, who lost their homes, their land, and their way of life. It remains a deeply traumatic event in their collective memory.",,91,"{'like_count': 67, 'comment_count': 24, 'num_users': 80930}",Gozie G Onu,,2023-10-14 22:23:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/380284792_6477705349014986_630204040735546317_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=XWusxM34m4EAX9Gslc9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBluzlP7rV6_IBcjMkIAzTs5GOwE1UoPCbWk8HesP12Ug&oe=655B2420,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZVYiJLIF5/,https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391320883_834678415069356_7415886744147973766_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=oEAnRcuXfVgAX86Ly1l&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAGaqvMoF4v7jGeiKHXz8hi2NRNkP3qrvlci54KGXbtQA&oe=653673AD

Finding your own peace of mind means attaining happiness, contentment, and bliss no matter how difficult things get in your life. It’s an inner peace that no one can rob us.

Finding happiness and inner peace does not depend on a problem-free life or the absence of conflict because we all go through challenges in our lives. It means attaining happiness, contentment, and bliss no matter how difficult things get in your life. 
.
One of my favourite all time movies is “Life is Beautiful” (La Vita è Bella). The movie, directed by Roberto Benigni, tells the story of Guido, a Jewish man who uses his humor and imagination to shield his son from the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp.

It’s a powerful story of love, hope and resilience amidst the darkest of times.

With so many wars being fought around the world, it is important we find ways to spread love, hope and find ways to remain resilient .

IT'S THE INNOCENT PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELI CITIZENS WHO ARE
THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE CONFLICT.

instagram,"On October 7th, the militant group Hamas, based in Palestine, initiated an assault on Israeli territory, resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives and the abduction of over 100 individuals. On October 13th, Palestinians from around the world came together to participate in the ""International Day of Action for Palestine."" In New York City, thousands of Palestinians were joined by various groups, including Americans for Palestine and Jews for Palestine, among others.

To Palestinians, this attack was perceived as a defensive response to what they regard as 'atrocities from Israel' during these seven and a half decades. An elderly Palestinian shared, 'For those of you unfamiliar with our history, it is a very confusing situation. Many may not even know that Israel was established 75 years ago, displacing Palestinians into the confines of Gaza, which constitutes a very small part of what Palestine was.'

Here are images captured during the rally in New York City.

Thank you to the beautiful souls who joined me live and are answering the call to embrace this program — I SEE YOU & I am here for you!

instagram,"Organizations representing a Livonia family and other Palestinian Americans ""trapped"" in the Gaza Strip are suing in the Eastern District of Michigan to expedite efforts to ensure their safe return to the U.S.

""I'm terrified; they haven't ever been in this situation before,"" said Yahya Alarayshi, whose parents, Zakaria Alarayshi and Laila Alarayshi, were supposed to return to Metro Detroit on Oct. 20. ""They are scared; they're not safe.""

A lawsuit was filed Friday by the Alarayshis, U.S. citizens of Palestinian ethnicity, who reside in Livonia, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and Arab Civil Rights League.

The lawsuit said the Alarayshis ""are currently trapped abroad in the Gaza Strip in an active war zone where they are under imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury,"" adding that the legal action was not an attempt to to interfere with the armed conflict in Israel and Palestine, but rather to ""compel a governmental agenc(ies) to initiate evacuation efforts and secure the safety and well-being of its citizens.""

On Saturday, evacuation orders from Israeli forces renewed calls for Gaza residents to stream south from their homes in north region of the territory, while Hamas urged civilians to stay in their homes, one week following their surprise attacks on Israel.

At a press conference Saturday afternoon outside the courthouse in downtown Detroit, Yahya Alarayshi said his parents remain stationed in place. He said they tried to reach the Egyptian border as State Department officials had instructed, but they were told it's closed and provided no information for evacuation.

Egyptian officials said the country's Rafah border crossing with Gaza would open Saturday for the first time in days to allow foreigners out. One official said both Israel and Palestinian militant groups had agreed to facilitate the departures, but by Saturday evening there had been no movement.",,83,"{'like_count': 81, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 20792}",Dearborn.org,,2023-10-14 23:08:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/192889224_766115007385179_2556295052646569426_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=v27XmW7d7KwAX972m3o&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCxIOl_wHqklZR-7pAqr4a7IDqQ5APHrw8bndLlsTaSHQ&oe=655B6982,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZajEfsGGG/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391477818_1391912888430424_824936456583652835_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=HX3ylv_GtZ8AX-72rG9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDlw9TZl__o9fby6Difx2KhU9gIfXgZkyXnFTt9Aqtq1Q&oe=6533E456

Having been fortunate enough to travel to Jerusalem, Germany, and Japan (epicenters of extreme conflict)- I've continued to try and understand how anyone could kill someone else for any reason, let alone for a feeling, thought, or belief. 

This first photo is in a market in Israel and the last is in Hiroshima, Japan. This middle is filled with the amazing memories, people, time, and experiences I had while traveling in Israel. Along with one of my visits to the Anne Franke House in Amsterdam. 

I'm Jewish. I don't believe in God. I think every person deserves to be heard. I think we all have a right to freedom over our own bodies. And I think extreme conflict for any reason is a waste of human energy. 

I side with humanity and I pray for a day when humans focus on helping each other daily because at the end of the day... each other and the planet we live on is truly all we have. And it is precisely why I wake up every day trying to simply help others.

""Two worlds bound by a pomegranate gate.

Toba Peres can speak but she can’t shout; she can walk but she can’t run; and she can write in five languages… with both hands at the same time.

Naftaly Cresques dreams every night of an orange-eyed stranger; when awake, he sees things that aren’t real; and he carries a book he can never lose and never read.

When the Queen of Sefarad orders all the nation’s Jews to leave or convert, Toba and Naftaly are forced to flee, but an unlucky encounter leaves them both separated from their caravan. Lost in the wilderness, Toba follows an orange-eyed stranger through a mysterious gate in a pomegranate grove, leaving Naftaly behind.

With a single step, Toba enters an ancient world that mirrors her own. There, she finds that her fate—and Naftaly’s—are bound to an ancient conflict threatening to destroy both realms.""

instagram,"For a more summarized version of the recent conflict between Palestine and Israel, please click below to read more.
•
•
Israeli settlement in 1967 completely destabilized the Palestinian residents, forcing them out of their homes and struggling to get by.Gaza's militant group the Hamas, was formed to overthrow the Israeli government in means to get their land back.

On the recent attack on Israel from Hamas during the weekend (Oct.7th/8th), it is believed that the militants may have been attempting to increase their base of support among ordinary Palestinians, particularly by using hostages to pressure Israel to release some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians detained in Israeli jails.

There have been 1,300 Israeli lives affected in this recent attack. With Israel’s retaliation, there have been 6,000 injured/dead Palestinian lives. Palestinian lives have been decreasing over the decades, dropping Gaza’s Palestinian population to 2 million, where 50% of that population is under the age of 15.

Israel has retaliated by committing international war crimes such as blockading the Gaza Strip, preventing medical aid from coming in. Cutting off essential needs such as food, water, and electricity. The Israeli military has made an announcement to Gaza civilians to evacuate to avoid getting injured in the crossfire. As civilians from Gaza made efforts to evacuate, they were attacked at the evacuation border.

As Americans, we need to educate ourselves and research where our tax dollars are going. The United States has donated over $260 billion to Israel in military aid over the years. Putting aside political opinions is crucial because civilian lives lost on Palestinian and Israeli lives are not something to remain silent about. 

As students, we are the future of this generation; educate yourselves and be mindful of the world around you. Please spread awareness, donate to medical aid units, and keep the mothers, fathers, and children in your prayers.

instagram,"Amid ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, rocket sirens blared in the cities of Tel Aviv and Ashdod on Friday. 

The latest attack on Friday night originating from the Gaza Strip has raised concerns about the safety of civilians. However, no injury cases have been reported yet.

The repeated incidents of rocket fire have instilled fear and uncertainty among the residents of Tel Aviv and Ashdod. People ran to the bomb shelter after security alarms were sounded in Tel Aviv and Gush Dan city on Friday.

The Israel-Hamas war entered the eighth day on Saturday. The conflict erupted after Hamas launched 5,000 rockets from Gaza on Israel on October 7. Immediately after the attack, Israel declared a ‘State of War’. Over 1000 people have been killed and more than 3000 have been injured in the attack.

instagram,"The war machine needs to be turned off. The killing of innocent humans no matter where they happen to live is still not acceptable. Trading bombs ,gunfire , chemical and biological weapons is disgusting and something all humans should be opposed to & strictly against. No one should be killed because of their location . I understand what is happening ...and I get that there has been innocent people massacred and taken hostage- this is a very gross situation -  but adding more death to innocent civilian populations will not change the problem of not finding a way for peace in this area. Governments are quick to act swiftly and powerfully to get rid of a problem - but it is difficult to see that working. I see both sides of this and feel great sadness that it always comes to this. Loss.  The loss of human life .  Words and ideas are shared in an attempt to try to get people to change their decision that maybe not everything is black and white. There are gray areas also sometimes , and two realities can both be true. I love all people and do not want to see the loss of any more human life.  Stealing the souls of others is always a horrible choice. I can honestly say I am totally against it. We have to do better as humans , using war, & horror tactics  to settle scores will be dangerous for everyone each and every time. Supporting human life should be the goal here- not accepting civilian casualties and creating a humanitarian crisis because they happen to live in the wrong place for your ideas . Asking people to walk away from everything they have ever had . Can you imagine that? Conflict resolution is what we all need to learn from and with each other, using technology and weaponry to annihilate each other is brutally savage no matter who is doing it. The world needs stronger leadership , more than ever, and people should not suffer because of that.  I am not saying people don't have rights to feel angry or devastated by any of what is happening. Of course there are very strong feelings on either side of this issue. The build up of this conflict has been long. It didn't start now.

Rest in Peace.

Park Seo-bo’s predominantly monochrome experiments with linear abstraction helped define Dansaekhwa, an essential movement within Korean modernism. Park is perhaps best known for his “Ecriture” series, which exemplifies the artist’s focus on material and process; in order to create precise, cumulative canvases, he penciled marks into still-wet painted surfaces, then layered Korean hanji paper overtop. Park graduated from Seoul’s Hongik University in 1954, when South Korea was still reeling from military conflict with North Korea. He has exhibited widely over the years, in galleries from Seoul and Busan to Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Beijing. His work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, and the Seoul Museum of Art, among many other institutions. His precise, minimalist practice filters Western notions of abstraction through the lenses of Korean calligraphy and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy.

Israel faced an unprecedented and cruel attack by Hamas, which began on a Jewish Holy Day. Over 1,300 Israelis have lost their lives, and more than 2,900 are injured. Over 150 were taken into captivity - mainly civilians. Many elderly, kids, and babies are held hostage in Gaza and now the current threat is to execute them.
Israel is defending itself, but the conflict continues, with no end in sight.

In response, Abraham has opened its doors to host evacuee families free of charge.
We gladly host these guests and try to take care of all their needs: supportive care, employment for children, food, and more. Civil organizations started to help us and we are grateful for any contribution that comes to help.
Because we see that the situation will go on, we are starting to collect donations for hosting and caring for the families of the evacuees in Abraham.

Your donations are essential to help those affected by the ongoing conflict.
Your support will offer help during these challenging times.

Palestinian liberation & Black liberation are inextricably linked. please keep in mind that those who condemn a people justified in their freedom cries, are people who wouldn't shed a tear for you. 

It's been high time for all of us to re-examine & reassess our relationships to & with people & entities we love because those who have refused to take this stance have no less than positioned themselves as our collective opposition. 

That said, I am deeply and forever grateful to & hate anti-Zionist homies who educated me so so many years ago about the plight of the Palestinian people and their ongoing resistance to ISRAEL occupation. Cus school definitely didn't do it. a reminder that we learn in community. that we all we got. so let's show them that our Palestinian sibs got us moving in solidarity with them. 

I implore us not to feed into the propaganda that anti-Zionism is anti-Judaism or fall prey to the weaponization of trauma as justification to violate, incarcerate and exterminate an entire population. 

This is not a conflict. 
There are no both sides. 
instead, we are witnessing the spawn of the U.S. imperialist war machine the Zionist regime commit Palestinian genocide ON OUR DIME in real time.

The only answer that I have,
Is I’m on the side of Peace.

I always say I’m Jewish,
It’s part of who I am.
So is speaking out 
For human rights as best I can.
This conflict is immoral
I want it all to cease
And that is why I take a stand
On the side of Peace.

When innocent civilians
Are killed day after day
By military massacres
I have the right to say
Collective punishment is wrong 
As the death tolls increase.
The only way to save lives
Is on the side of Peace.

Unlike so many others
I can’t support a nation
When it’s so horrific towards 
Part of the population
Yes, the leaders are not innocent
But the children are, indeed 
So are all the others who
Are on the side of Peace.

It’s easy to be silent
Or toe the party line
Complicity is for cowards
Who are part of the crime.
I will never be accused
Of groveling on my knees
I stand with my conscience
On the side of Peace.

instagram,"#onthisdayinhistory Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent advocacy for an end to segregation in the United States on October 14, 1964. The Nobel Peace Prize is an award created by Norwegian arms manufacturer and philanthropist Alfred Nobel. The award goes to any individual or organization that advances peace and diplomacy through their actions. MLK was the youngest recipient at the time, being only 35 years old. MLK was awarded the prize after the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In his acceptance speech, MLK said the following:

“I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at a moment when 22 million Negroes of the United States of America are engaged in a creative battle to end the long night of racial injustice. I accept this award on behalf of a civil rights movement which is moving with determination and a majestic scorn for risk and danger to establish a reign of freedom and a rule of justice.” 

King wondered why the civil rights movement was not given the prize since there was not a peace on all sides of the conflict. King concluded that “that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time — the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression… Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts. Negroes of the United States, following the people of India, have demonstrated that nonviolence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation. Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.”

King concluded his speech by saying that “peace is more precious than diamonds or silver or gold.” King donated the $54,123 he received in prize money and donated it to other parts of the Civil Rights Movement. #mlk #civilrights #nobelpeaceprize #civilrights",,70,"{'like_count': 70, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 8727}",This Day In History,,2023-10-14 13:08:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/21042428_282793038867025_3538533081688309760_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=_LLeUnlxYTUAX_t8Dtk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC8fix9mACtO4-jjWKnwuNhQfcgcQWyFiWxcUKCA8AqDw&oe=655B602B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyYV7JDOHks/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/358348974_718545079608257_1700713859033082227_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=p82aeL9lipYAX-XWBRb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA6TTpLa4wluHO7kMDWZsBA3Ovfjw0AgDAtX17jxruPJA&oe=653BDDF6

instagram,"Nearly eight in 10 Americans fear the war that erupted this week between Israel and Hamas will lead to a broader war in the Middle East, according to the latest PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll.

With seven in 10 U.S. adults saying they are closely following what is happening, the anxiety about further escalation is shared across political affiliation, geography, gender, race, income, education and age. A third of U.S. adults said they were “very concerned” about wider violence in the region, according to this latest poll.

Hamas militants made an unprecedented incursion into Israel during the early hours of Oct. 7, firing thousands of rockets and sending fighters past Israel’s blockade of Gaza to launch  deadly attacks on several communities and take scores of hostages. The combined death toll from both the surprise assault as well as Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in response has risen to at least 2,800 lives.

On Friday, Israel ordered 1.1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, despite a warning from the United Nations that the short deadline could be disastrous. The evacuation orders come ahead of Israel’s anticipated ground invasion against Hamas. In recent days, Israel cut off food, water and electricity to the besieged area, where more than 2 million predominantly Palestinian residents have been ruled since 2007 by Hamas, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group.

The violent conflict has inflamed long-running animosity between Israel and its neighbors, with Turkey calling that nation’s response “a massacre” and Iran warning that war could spread to other fronts. Israel announced on Friday that it had launched drone attacks against Hezbollah targets, amid other skirmishes along the Lebanese border. On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he “appealed to all parties” to quell violence, release Israeli hostages and respect international humanitarian law.

In vast federal prison kitchens, there are bake shops, prep kitchens, hot food kitchens, dish rooms and in some prisons their are kosher Kitchens…I learned some of my most valuable leadership lessons as I climbed the kitchen hierarchy. It was culture intelligence, conflict resolution, mental toughness, time management, and meal execution. 

27 years later I found away to transfer them leaderships skills into the mainstream workforce in some of the most celebrated hospitality brand in the world - Marriot, Ritz Carlton, Hotel Bel Air, Ceasars Palace, Hard Rock Hotel and the world renowned Bellagio in Las Vegas.

As a top book leadership, hospitality and food service speaker, I’ve been blessed with extraordinary opportunities to speak to some iconic restaurant groups, associations and franchises from Burger King, Texas roadhouse, California, MOD, Pizza, El Pollo Loco, Wendy’s, California Pizza kitchen, Papa John’s, Torcy Tacos, Chili’s, Nestlé’s, restaurant, leadership conference, and Aramark to name some of my favorites.

instagram,"“I choose to focus on ‘conflict transformation’ rather than the more traditional term’conflict resolution’. To me, the latter suggests going back to a previous state of affairs, and has a connotation that there may be a winner or a looser. How will this disagreement be resolved? Whose solution will be selected as the ‘ better’ one? In contrast, I choose to focus on ‘ conflict transformation’ suggesting that by creatively navigating the conversational landscape of differences and disagreements, we have the opportunity to create something new, at minimum we learn more about eachother than before. Ideally, we may find new possibilities that had not even been considered before. Conflict transformation is about creating deeper understandings. It requires perspective- taking.

instagram,"Update to my earlier post as the BBC retracted that statement in the image.

So much has been reported following the horrific terrorist attacks last weekend Saturday 7 October 2023 by Hamas that took the lives of so many innocent men, women, and children. 

Violence and murder is never justifiable. The images of dead children brings home the stark reminder of the scale of the loss of lives. 

We have to remember all the innocent victims of these attacks and to their friends and families who are grieving their loss or deeply worried about missing loved ones.

I am not going to pretend I am an expert in the long standing conflict in the region but I do believe in the hope for lasting peace and a two state solution where Palestinians and Israeli citizens can live. 

I recognise Israel’s right to defend herself, in line with international law and we have to call out the killing of innocent Palestinian civilians. It is estimated that the military response has left over 300,000 Palestinians displaced without food, shelter, and medical support.  It is important for the UK Government to work with the International Community to support a humanitarian response for essential supplies, to address the situation in Gaza.

We must distinguish Hamas terrorists from the Palestinian people. There must be humanitarian access to Gaza, for food, water, medicines and electricity.

There is ongoing reports of thousands of British Nationals stranded in Israel and Palestine.  Sadly, I have it confirmed that two Vauxhall constituents are stranded in Israel and I am working with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to try and bring them back safely to the UK.

The shocking rise in Antisemitism and Islamophobia is worrying and we all have a duty to call out all forms of hate and division. 

War and conflict is never the solution 😞",,67,"{'like_count': 62, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 4482}",Florence Eshalomi,,2023-10-14 13:11:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/46580049_502118793611263_1938503810825584640_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=UegKdlvwjNUAX87fB5x&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDXeq7bFnO1QdSnyxMw88n5i89rtbFk_YS1NhdaEv0gfg&oe=655A631F,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyYWRrzITi2/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390789039_1353793071875089_757683520252777852_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=trGfomZSqTUAX8xtGhq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAIsXw764k6Gm8AVLUlMtnqRM0Dfj5eeINmWphHewjpSg&oe=65588396

instagram,"Are you just beginning the journey to divorce a narcissist? Prior to stepping onto the battlefield with a Narcissist, it is imperative to know their playbook both forwards and backward. The behavior of narcissistic individuals is baffling but sadly, their tactics in the Family Court System often fool Judges, Commissioners, Attorneys, Minor’s Counsel, Social Workers, Therapists and even trained Evaluators. Narcissists are the masters of manipulation and projection and are known to launch stealth assaults that will leave their victims in an utter state of confusion and desperation. Victims are often left shattered and without a voice because they feel that no one could possibly believe or understand what they are silently enduring. 
In this one-hour course, Tina Swithin will provide you with an overview of divorcing a narcissist which includes the following topics:
* NPD 101 (knowing your opponent) 
* NPD traits that contribute to high-conflict divorce
* Hiring an attorney 
* Building your team 
* Strategy versus emotion
* Family court 101 (learning the system) 
* Organization 
* Standing firm in your truth 
* Communication
* Combating alienation claims 
* Custody evaluations

⁠
👉Israel’s military has announced a roughly six-hour window for Palestinians to continue fleeing south along specified routes inside of Gaza, as thousands vacate their homes following evacuation orders ahead of a possible Israel Defense Forces ground assault. ⁠
⁠
“Follow our instructions — move south of Wadi Gaza,” said IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht during a Saturday news briefing, suggesting residents who remain north of that geographic location may be faced with a possible Israeli offensive. ⁠
⁠
IDF officials also told the residents in northern regions they could continue to travel south on the territory’s main highways Saturday “without any harm” until 4 p.m. ⁠
⁠
The Israel Defense Forces confirmed early Friday that it had notified residents in Gaza City to leave for ""their own safety and protection"" after it vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters stormed through towns and villages in southern Israel last week, killing 1,300 Israelis, mainly civilians, and making off with scores of hostages. ⁠
⁠
""You will be able to return to Gaza City only when another announcement permitting it is made,"" IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said in a live-streamed briefing on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. ⁠

Rathika, 40, an associate professor from the Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College & Research Institute, Tiruchi, is stranded in Israel, amidst the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. She is on a two-month training programme on drip irrigation at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and had left for Israel on September 23, 2023, before the conflict broke out.

“My wife has been spending sleepless nights at Negev, which is close to Gaza,” said T. Ramesh, Rathika’s husband, also an associate professor, and Head of the Department of Agronomy at Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU). According to Ramesh, Rathika is currently hiding in an underground bunker, awaiting rescue, following the breaking out of the conflict in the region. “Whenever the sirens wail, she has to rush to the basement and take shelter in a bunker, where she stays for around 30 minutes to an hour, or sometimes until the sirens cease,” he said.

Do not allow yourself to lose your humanity in this moment. To all the people unfollowing me this week I send you love and healing. 

I pray that we can forge a world where our shared humanity is the foundation and the lives of our global siblings and all of our children are equal and valued.
 
Calls for peace are empty and hollow without calls for justice. The root of violence is dehumanization, oppression and injustice.
 
We need healing on a scale much larger than we may think is possible. A one sided narrative only creates further disinformation and division.
 
So much of the narrative that we see unfold in the mainstream media and on social media is very one sided with so many whataboutisms, lack of understanding and nuance of the historical context of this crises. 

Empty blanket statements help no one and only serve to uphold the paradigm of wyt supremacy and structures and systems of oppression. I have been sharing a lot about this in my stories. 

Adopting a decolonial mindset is pivotal when it comes to understanding the root causes of oppression. 

None of us are truly free until all of us are free. None of us can be well until all of us have access to being well. The Palestinians have not had this for 75 years.

instagram,"On July 1, 1863, the three days long Battle of Gettysburg began. One of the conflict's first casualties was Lancaster resident Major General John F. Reynolds. He was shot through the neck by a Confederate sharpshooter while leading his men into battle. Reynolds died instantly from the wound, becoming the highest-ranking soldier on either side killed at Gettysburg.
.
However, Reynolds' story doesn't end with his death. Shortly before the battle, Reynolds (a Protestant) had secretly engaged his longtime Catholic sweetheart, Catherine Mary Hewitt. After a discreet courtship, they planned to marry upon his return from Gettysburg.
.
This is where things get interesting. Some believe Kate's grief was so deep that Reynolds' spirit never found peace. As such, his ghost wanders the streets between the Fulton and his family home, looking to meet his fiancé just as he had promised he would more than 150 years ago. So if you feel a chill while walking near 42-44 West King Street and notice a tall, handsome, anachronistic dressed man, there's a good chance you just saw Reynolds' ghost.

instagram,"Hi friends,

Since many of you have asked, my first Sunday at Central Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) will be October 29th.  There are in-person worship services at 8:30 AM and 11 AM, and you can always catch the 11 AM on Facebook Live. 

I'm looking forward to starting a new chapter in a familiar place, and hope to see those of you who'd like to join us!

--The window in the picture is a focal point of Central's sanctuary. I've always loved the way it expresses a theology of presence and solidarity (""...Became Flesh and Dwells Among Us."") The panel in the lower right has been on my mind during this season of violence, war, and global conflict.--

And of course, for those of you wanting to know more, Central is MANY things:

1. A Founding Congregation of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)

2. A Justice-Seeking Open and Affirming Congregation. (See the Central welcome statement: www.centralchristianlex.org/who-we-are)
3. A Place dedicated to beautiful worship and community.

4. A Place where the table is open to all. And All means all.

Prince Faisal emphasized the urgent need to prevent more innocent civilians from falling victim to the ongoing cycle of violence. He stressed that Israel must abide by international humanitarian law and avoid any actions that contradict it, as such actions will only worsen the current crisis and increase the suffering in the region.

instagram,"The news cycle has been heavy this past week with natural disasters and conflict affecting children in so many places. 

While children in Australia are physically removed from these devastating circumstances, it can be difficult to control what they see and hear and the feelings it evokes. It's important to speak with your child about what's happening globally, not only about the facts (in an age-appropriate way) but also about what's being done to help children and families caught in crises.

instagram,"Beach reading before the rain starts.
.
In the spring of 1742, a Shawnee war party journeyed hundreds of miles to the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay to recruit allies for a war against the English colonists. The once-mighty but diminished Nanticokes, whose great-grandparents had greeted Captain John Smith with arrows, invited several other tribes—the Choptank, Assateague, Pocomoke, and Askecksy Indians—to meet at a place called Wimbesocom. A daring plan was proposed: With the help of hundreds of fierce northern warriors, the Eastern Shore tribes would carry out a surprise raid against their English neighbors and slaughter everyone-men, women, and children.
.
Meanwhile, French forces would land on the coast and help them drive the white man off the peninsula, splitting the English colonies.
.
If they succeeded, they would remake the destiny of North America.
.
If they failed, they might lose their lands forever.
.
1742 traces the history of the Nanticoke Indians and other Eastern Shore tribes from their first contact with English colonists through decades of bloody conflict and bitter concessions, revealing a simmering resistance which boiled over during what historian C. A. Weslager called ""the most important single event in Indian history on the Delmarva Peninsula.”

instagram,"Just finished reading this incredible book, and I could not recommend it enough! I’ve never posted a book review before, but this one was worth it. Read my brief thoughts below ⬇️

Yousef skillfully personifies the complexities of the region, offering readers an inside look at the workings and beliefs of the Hamas organization. His journey from being born into a culture of terrorism to actively pursuing peace is nothing short of extraordinary. This book is a must-read for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the ongoing complexities surrounding Palestine and Israel, as it sheds light on the human experiences behind the headlines.

Mosab Hassan Yousef's narrative is not just a captivating story but a testament to the potential for change and reconciliation in even the most entrenched conflicts. His firsthand account provides invaluable insights, making ""Son of Hamas"" a compelling and enlightening read.

instagram,"I can’t post normally as if our world isn’t in turmoil. We’re privileged to be safe at home, but my heart is in the east. I’m sick over the bloodshed of innocents, families destroyed by terrorism, and the vicious cycle of violence that continues on. 

In 2019, @dadavidcoe and i took this photo with the Ahava sculpture at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Ahava אהבה means ‘love’ in Hebrew, and that’s what I’m holding onto hardest, as I pray for those held hostage, for humanity, healing, and peace. 

I’m Jewish, and my best friend and sister of 20 years is Palestinian. Despite what headlines would have you believe, as usual, our feelings align and we are united. There is no debate that each human life is sacred, that Hamas is evil personified, that slaughter of civilians is monstrous, and that in wartime, nobody wins.  This is not the first time we will cry and commiserate over the suffering in Gaza, nor will it be the last. 
 
This century long conflict is being reduced to quick quips and hot takes, and I implore you to please, look beyond black-and-white propaganda to see the human suffering, the shades of grey. You can support Palestinian human rights while calling out the evil of Hamas. You can acknowledge Israel as the ancestral Jewish homeland while disagreeing with actions of its government. 

Violence only begets violence, and I feel so helpless. I’ll light extra Shabbat candles tonight, for all who cannot, and for hope, which flickers faintly even in these dark times.

instagram,"Neutrality is not an Option

Since the Israel-Palestine conflict has flared up, many on the broader Right have insisted that this is not their conflict. Apparently, we should remain indifferent to the ethnic cleansing and barbarity of the Israeli’s, the plight of the Palestinians is something to ignore.

Yet to avert your gaze from the scenes of the wounded children, dilapidated buildings and unmitigated terror which is ravaging Gaza, is to misunderstand what it means to be a nationalist. 

The Palestinians were in fact the first people to experience “The Great Replacement” when Zionist settlers began to illegally immigrate to Palestine. From the late 19th century starting with the Ottomans and through the British Mandate, successive governments attempted to regulate and limit Jewish migration to Palestine but with no avail. 

Aside from their test run on population replacement with the Palestinians, Zionist Israel is practically an open portal to hell. Israeli scientists are responsible for the COVID vaccines (Pfizer & Moderna) while Israel is home to Teva Pharmaceuticals, the world’s largest producer of trans hormones, hormone blockers and medication. Israel is also one of the world’s largest manufacturers of weaponry and military technology which they sell to bloodthirsty Muslim nations like Azerbaijan who in turn ethnically cleanse multiple millennia old Christian populations like the Armenians of Artsakh. 

When the evidence comes into full view, American & European nationalists must not remain neutral, as the Israeli’s certainly don’t. When Israeli & Jewish NGO’s like Isra-AID or HIAS organize migrant caravans into the West, are they being neutral? 

When Israeli “science” and “medicine” warps the minds of our youth and deconstructs the fundamental underpinnings of humanity itself, are the Israeli’s acting as honest brokers?

When Israel & the Jewish diaspora petition our governments to wage wars which have erased Christianity from its historic home in the Levant, was that just an accident?

instagram,"Enlightenment, in its simplest form, is about accepting reality as it is, without resistance. It’s about letting go of our preconceived notions, our judgments, our desires for how things should be. It’s about embracing the present moment, in all its beauty and imperfection.

Resistance creates conflict, tension, and suffering. It’s a barrier that keeps us from experiencing life fully, from seeing the truth clearly. When we resist what is, we create a divide between ourselves and reality. We become entangled in our thoughts, our fears, our illusions.

On the other hand, the absence of resistance brings peace, clarity, and freedom. It allows us to flow with life, rather than against it. It opens our eyes to the wonder of the present moment, to the wisdom inherent in each experience.

So, let’s strive for enlightenment. Let’s strive to let go of resistance, to accept what is. Let’s strive to live in the present, to embrace reality as it is. Because in the end, enlightenment is nothing more than the complete absence of resistance to what is.

Remember, the journey to enlightenment is not a destination, but a journey. It’s not about reaching a certain point, but about continuously growing, learning, and evolving. It’s about embracing humility, fostering empathy, and recognizing our interconnectedness. So, let’s embark on this journey, one step at a time, one breath at a time. Because in the end, we are not just individuals on separate paths, but parts of a larger whole, moving together towards enlightenment.

instagram,"People trapped in Gaza have nowhere safe to go to.

When people hear of shelters in a conflict zone, images of reinforced structures stocked with supplies come to mind. This is not the case in Gaza.

Families trapped in Gaza have no access to electricity, fuel, food or water and are enduring unimaginable death and destruction.

instagram,"I recalled the history we learned of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict. So many people died, mostly innocent civilians, that their numbers are not even concise. The total number of deaths was likely more than 150,000 but may have been more than 200,000. We were taught that this was necessary to save lives, a strange calculus to use when discussing the use of asymmetrical weaponry that would go on to cause long-term health consequences to those within the radii of the bombed cities. Many more innocent people were injured and traumatized, their lives forever broken by bombs dropped upon them for a war they did not choose to wage. Nevertheless, the loss of their lives was viewed as a ""necessary and less evil option"" in the math of war.

We will never know what would have happened if the people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki would have been spared of such horrific destruction and trauma. Those days are forever sealed in our history. Those who died - innocent men, women, children - were intentionally denied their right to life by a cold calculation devoid of empathy because an emporer they did not choose allied their country with the Axis powers and waged war against enemies the innocent people also did not choose.

I will never support the intentional killings of any innocent civilians, no matter where they live or who their leaders are. As someone whose government often violates what they deem to be ethical values, I know that leaders of people are far too often more concerned about their own power and ego than what is ethical and right. I do not wish to be judged by the actions of leaders that do not align with my values. I think most people feel this way. Let the leaders meet in war rooms to fight with one another, and leave the rest of us out of it so that we can live our lives. 

I will always be on the side of the innocent.

instagram,"Labour utterly condemns Hamas’s appalling terrorist attacks on Israel that led to such brutal loss of life, including of British citizens.

We stand in solidarity with Israel in these dark hours and urge that all hostages should be released.

We fully support Israel’s right to defend itself, rescue hostages and protect its civilians.

As we have said from the beginning, that right must be exercised in line with international law, and civilians must be protected.

The situation in Gaza is heart-breaking. Both Israelis and Palestinians are suffering terribly because of Hamas’s actions. I am deeply saddened by the loss of innocent life in Gaza.

There must be a clear distinction between Hamas terrorists and the Palestinian people. 

It is vital that there is continued humanitarian access to Gaza, and continued supplies of food, water, electricity and medicines.

The Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy MP and Shadow Cabinet Minister for International Development Lisa Nandy MP are in touch with the UK government, the UN and NGOs to discuss the best way to protect civilians, including humanitarian corridors within Gaza. None of us want civilians to suffer.

We must not allow these tragic events to divide our communities. The Community Safety Trust and the police have reported a steep increase in antisemitic incidents in recent days, including abuse and assaults. Tell Mama has also reported a tripling of cases to their services within the last six days, including reports of Islamophobic threats, abuse and assaults.

We denounce hate crime in the strongest terms. We expect to see a robust response to all incidents of hate associated with the conflict, and call on government to support these groups and to play their part in preventing an escalation of tensions.

Locally I have been in close contact with our police and others. We are proud of our diverse communities and I know many people will be feeling deeply affected, or may even be directly affected, by these events.

Community and faith organisations across the country are playing their part in efforts to bring down tensions and in bringing people back together.

In a long-standing conflict between Isreal and Palestine/Hamas , the elusive truth remains a casualty. For decades, these nations have engaged in relentless battles, marked by bombings, skirmishes, and unprovoked raids. Amid this chaos, the battle for truth intensifies as media outlets and governments manipulate news and reports, leaving the public struggling to discern fact from fiction.

Amid the fog of war, some undeniable facts emerge. Israel boasts state-of-the-art radars and Iron Dome security systems, yet these sophisticated defenses failed to detect an impending threat. Astonishingly, Egypt had issued warnings to Israel and the US three days prior, raising questions about the effectiveness of intelligence networks.

Adding to the intrigue, the international stage witnesses a curious contrast. While the US and UK boldly flex their military might with battleships in the sea, their response to the Ukrainian-Russian conflict pales in comparison.

instagram,"Israeli airstrikes continue on the 8th day in Gaza ⤵️ 

The conflict began last Saturday when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood against Israel, a multi-pronged surprise attack including a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel via land, sea, and air.

Hamas said the operation was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem and Israeli settlers’ growing violence against Palestinians.

The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets within the Gaza Strip.

Israel's response has extended into cutting water and electricity supplies to Gaza, further worsening the living conditions in an area that endured a crippling siege since 2007, as well as ordering over 1 million Gazans to evacuate their homes in the north and go to the south in less than 24 hours.

quick translation:

Caption - ""Rather than holler...""

"" *To young people who don't know what to say*

Try a quiet moment to study the history of that region.

Studying is neither Twitter nor slogans.

It's being able to absorb history and *contradiction*

Read novelists, historians, and journalists from *every angle*

Every sensible person wishes, I believe, that Palestine have its own state and that Israel be safe. 

Calling down hate upon one people or another will only bring about carnage everywhere.

Hamas rejoices in both Palestinian and Israeli deaths.

Without the help of the entire region, this conflict will never end.""

The size of the bison herd in Yellowstone and how to maintain that number has been a source of conversation, conflict, and collaboration over the decades. This August, the National Park Service released a 137 page draft of their Environmental Impact Statement for how to manage the shaggy creature within the park boundaries.

Nonetheless, many got their ears and knees ‘knee deep’ into it and fell off the performance table of their own life, even in the SOF community to pro athletes etc. 

Well this time around, there’s even more distractions and are going to be even more possible intimate threats, from a dynamical standpoint. So if anything that’s the time to kick in 5th gear and be more prepared, productive and healthy.

instagram,"Feeling ‘triggered’ will have us behaving in some less than ideal ways if we aren’t careful…

Conflict, and difficult conversations in general, have the tendency to get really emotionally charged and can often result in feeling triggered, overwhelmed, and scared. 

In these moments, many of us feel so desperate to get our point across… to feel seen, heard, and understood… that we might start to behave in ways that we think will keep us ‘safe’ vs. ways that are actually most effective for getting what we need.

There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the desire to feel seen, heard, and understood… however, there are certainly some methods that are more conducive to getting this need met than others. 

If effective and appropriate communication and conflict resolution were not taught nor role modeled during your upbringing, it can feel really foreign to try to do so now. 

However, just because it takes a lot of work and practice, doesn’t mean it isn’t achievable. 

Start by increasing self-awareness around your triggers, your maladaptive responses, and the methods that are most effective for helping you to regulate when feeling upset… these three areas of self-awareness are a great place to start when learning how to respond vs. react. ♥️

instagram,"Conflict and war can often bring with it prejudice and discrimination, whether against people or a country. 

When talking to your children, avoid labels like “bad people” or “evil” and instead use it as an opportunity to encourage compassion, such as for the children and families who have lost their homes, have no water or electricity.

Even when a conflict is happening in a distant country, it can fuel discrimination on our doorstep. Get curious and ask your children whether they experiencing or contributing to bullying. If they have called others names or joined in with bullying explore what is going on that led them to want to hurt someone this way. Hold back from punishing or losing it on your child, model what compassion and curiosity look like instead of 

Remind your child that everyone deserves to be safe at school and in society. We should each do our part to spread kindness and support each other, this is particularly important at times when the world is full of pain.

Check if your child would like to participate in taking positive action. Perhaps they could participate in a local fundraiser, join a petition or add some of their pocket money towards the Red Cross or other organisation helping on the ground. 

♥️The sense of doing something, no matter how small, can often bring great comfort.

“In recent years, activists for peace in the Middle East have adopted the hamsa hand. Because hamsa hand symbology is believed to predate most modern religions, those who actively support a peaceful resolution to the ongoing Israeli conflict believe that wearing the hamsa hand highlights not only the similarities of Judaism and Islam, but also the similarities of the origins of the religions.”

As Philip Jensen wrote in Apocalypse Again and Again, some of you are doves who oppose all war and violence. Others are more like hawks, looking for a fight/use of force to get their way. Others see war as an issue of timing. Some of you hold an “at last” we must now act, and finally, some sit on the fence not knowing what to think.

Give charity to those who hold a different attitude towards war than you. Yet please, above all else, pray for peace in our world. While we debate theories, others are living through hell on earth.

instagram,"Blurb 

Declared unfit for active service after the Great War, Richard Hansen feels rudderless and out of place. But when the unthinkable happens and the shadow of a new conflict looms, he is thrust into enemy territory once again for a final, covert mission.

Devastated and mourning her own catastrophic losses, his wife Emily is alone and adrift in a once-idyllic marriage grown cold and distant. When one day a surprise visitor comes calling she is faced with a choice that may grant her the very thing she has always longed for… or lead her into terrible danger.

As Europe goes to war a second time and Richard and Emily’s paths are wrenched apart, each must confront the ghosts of their own past, battling forces both seen and unseen as their lifelong love is tested to its limits - by duty, grief, time, and betrayal.

instagram,"Many people fail to make progress because they are unable to master their drives and instincts, specifically our need for food. Our nutrition is tied to with our emotional life and is ultimately the battle ground in which we strengthen the will. The person who is unable to deny themselves soon finds it difficult to endure other forms of discomfort such as conflict and stress.

However, the world hears this with infected ears. The world teaches that the goal is to be slim and in have a pleasing appearance. As with most things, the world takes something that is good and distorts it with subtle lies. A person does not necessarily have temperance if they are thin or have a six pack. Likewise, a person is not necessarily a glutton if they are overweight. The reason is that the overall health of a person involves many factors, such as hormones and DNA, and while there is a connection between health and virtue, it is not necessarily as direct as some would believe.

That being said, I think we are entering a new era in asceticism where we can take the genuine insights from the tradition and integrate them with contemporary understanding of nutrition.

The main distinction we need to make when understanding the history of Christian fasting and asceticism is between a caloric deficit and a simple diet…

I do believe in the power of prayer, I witnessed how prayer did help in my own experience, in many circumstances. I hope this can be of comfort to anyone suffering. 🙏🏼🕊️✨

“Lord, we confess that at times, we feel overwhelmed by the storm. But Today, we lift our eyes to you — the Maker of heaven and earth. And we ask for a miracle… let your peace fill Israel and Gaza. 
God, let violence cease in the region. Let there be no more bloodshed. We know your heart breaks for those killed and those left behind — for the orphaned child, the injured elderly, those abducted and families desperate for safety. Lord, speak into this crisis. 
We pray for those who have lost loved ones. Let your peace and love wash over them. Please protect and provide for those who have been abducted and bring them home safely. Let them be reunited with their loved ones — let them feel the comfort of their embrace.
God, we pray that you open doors that allow food, essentials and medical supplies to reach those in need. May first responders be able to rescue the injured, comfort the grieving and help rebuild many lives. 
God, we pray for your peace and reconciliation to overcome conflict. We ask that you give wisdom and discernment to our global leaders and those in positions of power who have the ability to impact the course of this war. Help us to be bold advocates and agents of peace in our own communities.
We pray for people scattered around the globe whose friends and family members have been caught in the crisis. We know you are with them. Help us to express your love to those affected. 
Lord, we raise Israel and Gaza to you, and pray for those suffering. We ask that you provide peace in this crisis, and protection and comfort for all those who have been impacted. 
We lift our prayer to you, Lord, hear us. “🙏🏼✨

instagram,"What is the responsibility of a newsroom in a time like this? This is the question we asked ourselves as the horrors of war streamed onto our televisions and social media feeds. 

We know that many expect us to pick a position; just as they do for every other entity in the 21st-century globalised world – from football clubs to fast food chains.

But nuance drowns in a sea of noise. 

The Mail & Guardian’s stance on the “Palestinian question” has always been unequivocal. As a publication born during the dying grip of apartheid, we support the Palestinian right to autonomy and denounce the creeping occupation of its land.

That does not mean we support the violence wrought by the firing of thousands of rockets by Hamas into Israel, or that country’s retaliatory bombing of Gaza. We condemn all violence inflicted on civilians in any conflict around the globe. 

We are acutely cautious, however, of playing into an asinine, binary view of the world.

გვიხარია, რომ ჩვენმა პროექტმა, #EU4Dialogue, ახალი იდეები და შთაგონება შესძინა ლალი ომაძეს, ენერგიულ და შრომისმოყვარე ქალს, რომელიც სოფელ ფხვენისში, ცხინვალის რეგიონის გამყოფი ხაზის სიახლოვეს ცხოვრობს.

ევროკავშირისა და UNDP-ის ერთობლივი პროგრამის #EU4Dialogue დახმარებით, შიდა ქართლის რეგიონში სოფლად მცხოვრები ქალები ახალ ცოდნასა და უნარებს იძენენ, სხვადასხვა სახის ტრენინგში ერთვებიან და თავის სამეწარმეო საქმიანობაში მეტ წარმატებას აღწევენ. 

ბევრი ასეთი პროექტი ხორციელდება ადგილობრივ არასამთავრო ორგანიზაციებთან, მათ შორის, ""მშვიდობის კვლევის ცენტრი თბილის""-თან თანამშრომლობით. 

#EU4Dialogue აქტიურად უჭერს მხარს ადგილობრივ სამოქალაქო ინიციატივებს, რომლებიც სოფლად მცხოვრები ქალებისა და ახალგაზრდების ხელშეწყობას ისახავს მიზნად. საქართველოს სხვადასხვა რეგიონში, ამ დახმარებით უკვე ასობით ადამიანმა ისარგებლა.

""I realized my potential! Now I'm considering growing a vineyard and expanding my business.""

We're thrilled that our #EU4Dialogue project inspires women, like Lali Omadze, a dynamic and determined resident of Pkhvenisi village, located near the Administrative Boundary Line with South Ossetia/Tskhinvali region.

EU4Dialogue empowers rural women in Shida Kartli and other conflict-affected regions, equipping them with knowledge and skills, offering diverse training opportunities, and helping them thrive as entrepreneurs. Many of these initiatives are in collaboration with local civil society organizations, such as the ""Peace Research Centre Tbilisi.""

Through EU4Dialogue, @euingeorgia and UNDP champion local civic endeavours that support rural women and youth, and benefit hundreds of people across Georgia.

instagram,"As part of the humanitarian efforts undertaken by the UAE to provide urgent assistance to the Palestinian people, Dubai and the rest of the emirates (soon) have launched a campaign to provide relief aid to the Palestinian people impacted by the war in the Gaza Strip, under the theme ‘Tarahum - for Gaza’.

The campaign will be inaugurated on Sunday, 15th October 2023, in Abu Dhabi, under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent at the Abu Dhabi Ports Hall in Mina Zayed from 9 am - 4 pm, and will be organized across the rest of the Emirates at a later date.
this campaign aims to mitigate the severity of the humanitarian conditions, and alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable groups, especially children, who constitute nearly half of the population of the Gaza Strip. More than one million children are affected by the current conflict, and the campaign will work towards providing children and mothers with basic needs, in addition to health supplies and general hygiene materials. 
The aid will be sent through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

أطلقت دولة الامارات العربية المتحدة حملة لإغاثة الاشقاء الفلسطينيين المتأثرين من الحرب في قطاع غزة، تحت شعار ""تراحم من أجل غزة"". 
تنطلق الحملة الاحد غداً في أبوظبي تحت إشراف هيئة الهلال الأحمر الاماراتي في قاعة موانئ ابوظبي في ميناء زايد من الساعة 9 صباحا – 4 عصرا، على ان يتم تنظيمها في باقي الإمارات لاحقاً.
 وتهدف هذه الحملة التضامن مع الأطفال الفلسطينيين والأسر المتأثرة من الحرب الدائرة والعمل على التخفيف من حدة الأوضاع الإنسانية، ورفع المعاناة عن الفئات الأكثر ضعفا وخاصة الأطفال الذين يشكلون ما يقرب من نصف سكان القطاع (ما يزيد على مليون طفل) من خلال توفير الاحتياجات الأساسية لهم ولامهاتهم إضافة إلى المستلزمات الصحية ومواد النظافة العامة.

To sit around the table with food to eat, water to drink, with those you love safe by your side is a gift. I am so grateful for dinners with some of mine. My prayers are with everyone missing a loved one right now. It is so easy to feel powerless in times like these but our compassion is our power. 

We all have a light inside of us and the power to re-ignite hope for someone who is hurting right now.

There are so many innocent people suffering around the world, their lives destroyed or disrupted by foreign invasions, conflict, natural disasters, and senseless hatred and violence.

May we keep in our minds that innocent people are not their governments as we keep praying for the suffering to end.

Your high-conflict ex isn't going to become easy to deal with suddenly. 

There's not going to be some terrible accident. 

AND

They're never going to stop counter-parenting whilst pretending to coparent.

You want peace and freedom? 

Stop waiting. 

It's time to get resourceful mumma 🛑 

Your time, energy, and finances have all been impacted negatively by your coparent. I get it.

Your children are internalising the chaos, setting them up for future struggles in relationships and self-esteem.

👉 SAVE this to see how you can:

✔️ Ditch the outdated rulebook
✔️ Level up with parallel parenting, and 
✔️ Become Unshakeable. 

Your coparent may be a lot of things but they should NOT have power over your freedom.

No more excuses 🔥

""Today, Iran conveyed a message to Israel through the United Nations, according to which if the IDF operation in Gaza continues, it will be forced to intervene, according to a diplomatic source privy to the details according to Walla news.

An Iranian response - whether directly, whether through the militias in Syria and Iraq or whether by providing backing for Ĥ*zɓ*ll*h's entry into the fighting, will turn the current crisis in Gaza into a regional war.

According to a diplomatic source, the Iranian Foreign Minister told the UN envoy that Iran is not interested in turning the conflict in Gaza into a regional war and wants to bring about the release of the kidnapped citizens. However, he emphasized that Iran has red lines and will be forced to respond if the IDF's operation in Gaza continues. The UN envoy delivered the words to the head of the National Assembly.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdullahian met today in Beirut with the UN Middle East Envoy Tor Vansland.

A Western diplomat unaware of the details noted that the Iranian foreign minister returned specifically from Damascus to Beirut once more to meet with the UN envoy. This was the first ever meeting between the UN envoy and an Iranian official.

The Iranian Foreign Minister said today in a briefing for reporters in Beirut after his meeting with Ĥ*zɓ*ll*h Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah that Israel must stop its war crimes immediately because it may be too late in a few hours.

The Iranian Foreign Minister said that Hezbollah had prepared several escalation scenarios that would cause an earthquake in Israel.

After the meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister, the UN envoy spoke with National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi and with other officials in the Israeli government and conveyed the message to them. There was no response from the Prime Minister's Office."" https://news.walla.co.il/item/3616135",,18,"{'like_count': 10, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 1505}",Mary Boberry,,2023-10-14 21:34:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/391384442_343912764798472_8257925496532348221_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ryBiTnadhJoAX-nLcQ-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD9yEROXo-zcm5QnIvoa1dgXCA8C-pAazua4-rKqDP39w&oe=655A18B5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZPxc9rip7/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/358170610_197996079911773_861795784850568007_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=U2Jy2pXY41kAX95y6Dl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCBvYV_NIkMP8WSGt_hh00LJ3k42FQ7DOAncTyW3PZSIA&oe=65422EA7

Falcon is a kid. He thinks he hears the call of magic, and the voice of one of the Great Spirits seems to whisper in his ears. He’s come to the urban jungle of Seattle to seek his calling.

Thrown together, veteran and novice, Sly and Falcon find themselves embroiled in a deadly confrontation between the world's most powerful corporations. And if it’s not stopped, this conflict could turn to all-out warfare, spilling out of the shadows and into the streets…

Hundreds of Thai Muslims attended Friday prayers at Pattani Central Mosque in Muang district of Pattani province on Friday (October 13).
.
The prayers on Friday included “Qunut Nazilah”, a supplication for Allah's protection from harm at times of calamity, aimed at sending moral support to Palestinians who are undergoing enormous suffering because of the war between the Hamas militant group and the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip since last week.
.
The mosque’s Imam, who led the prayers, told those present that they were lucky to be born in Pattani, the land with no war, and urged them to pray for other Muslim brothers and sisters for their safety and peace in the conflict-ridden region.

instagram,"The 2023 Global Hunger Index shows that far too many people go to bed hungry. Hunger remains serious or alarming in 43 countries, while progress in many countries has stagnated or even reversed due to conflict, climate change and the global pandemic.

But there are positives to take from the #GHI23. 

Despite the challenges facing the world, some countries—including Bangladesh, Chad, Djibouti, Lao PDR, Mozambique, Nepal, and Timor-Leste—have shown remarkable progress since 2015. Bangladesh has gone from a GHI score of 26.2 in 2015, to 19.0 this year. 

Concern Worldwide has been working in Bangladesh for 51 years, supporting people like Hosenare through programmes like Collective Responsibility, Action and Accountability for Improved Nutrition (CRAAIN).

Hosenare received training on nutrition, climate-smart agriculture techniques, water use, and sanitation and was provided with a goat and four ducks. Her participation helped her build up her small farm while enabling her family to withstand climate shocks such as typhoons and flooding. 

She said: “I feel empowered and have a dream of increasing my small farm. I received just one goat, and now I have three. I dream of having 10 or more to help me earn more and preserve my farm.”

instagram,"Look, I really don’t care what side of the current conflict you take. In fact, I think being on either side exclusively is deeply cringe. 

That said, can we stop it with the boomer evangelicalism about the who the chosen people are? The OT makes it extremely clear that to be a part of the nation but unfaithful is no better than being a pagan. Also, people from an non ethnic background are joined to God’s people (Phineas, Rahab, Ruth, etc.) through faithfulness and obedience. 

The NT is equally clear that those who reject Christ reject God. Every Gospel is unequivocal about this, and we see it play out in Acts of the Apostles. St. Paul gives the theological reasoning and explanation of what the Law was for, and who Israel was supposed to be, and who the current children of St. Abraham are. 

God desires faithfulness, not geopolitical standing. The point isn’t to castigate the Israelites, it’s to examine ourselves and see if we also are rejecting God by failing to keep His commandments.",,15,"{'like_count': 15, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 180}",Smoke and Memory,,2023-10-14 16:43:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/358820923_163682896719817_5150404658412341863_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=5_Py0OGGjecAX9Q9Fgg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCj7dYWVcrvr2chrZuZkkQJSxqEJgyWt7vMlU6n08o3LQ&oe=655B5CE5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyYujahsqhr/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391587807_344837277919586_1780418756597570067_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=iuyIKPuzCtkAX9VQ0Sh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDGVnUgInIBOYeZdfKsxE11-J_xlkBPmNFzklKDP3Z0GQ&oe=655A9C7B
