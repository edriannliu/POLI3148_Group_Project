facebook,"🚨 𝐁𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐊𝐈𝐍𝐆: Bayern statement on Noussair Mazraoui and his pro Palestine post… FC Bayern München had a detailed and clarifying conversation with Noussair Mazraoui this week. The reason for the debate was Mazraoui's Instagram posts in connection with the terror against Israel almost two weeks ago, which led to irritation and criticism. “Noussair Mazraoui has credibly assured us that, as a peace-loving person, he resolutely rejects terror and war. He regrets if his posts have caused irritation,” says Jan-Christian Dreesen, CEO of FC Bayern, and explains: “FC Bayern condemns Hamas’ attack on Israel.” - “In addition,” explains Noussair Mazraoui, “I condemn every kind of terrorism and every terrorist organization.” FC Bayern and Noussair Mazraoui resolutely oppose the transfer of the Middle East conflict and its violence to Germany, which is committed to peace. Hatred and violence of any kind have no place in Germany's political culture. FC Bayern stands on the side of the Jewish community in Germany and on the side of Israel; nothing justifies the murder of children and families. FC Bayern is convinced that football should develop its power of balancing between different cultures, especially in the most difficult moments. Noussair Mazraoui will remain in the FC Bayern squad, but is currently out due to an injury he sustained during an international match with the Moroccan national team.",,22438,"{'like_count': 16427, 'comment_count': 2006, 'num_users': 16077785}",Fabrizio Romano,,2023-10-20 09:53:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/347110386_993663875383747_583934797072922306_n.jpg?stp=c0.5.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=uAna8ATw69UAX93KeX8&_nc_oc=AQk2rCHjztzJxOcddrLEXGX3rPeu736OQrsOUvBC48VfyB9RTV0Uj71jjrHXipSTb8I&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAMfNepRd8V07wlKL-xq1YKtV0tjL2U_Ymv8SCyPj3hTQ&oe=655B6900,https://www.facebook.com/100057525006204/posts/927063452554480,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394257042_927055045888654_1605910063624224580_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=R-2IgpOyAdEAX89qHd4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCYIdVSSlV3jAln5-iOJXUo4ObrHnpgVcLdeHlkFet_YQ&oe=6559334F

Constructed in the 13th century during the tumultuous times of the Albigensian Crusade, the Chateau de Najac was not just a symbol of power but a guardian of a region rife with conflict. Its formidable stone walls, constructed to withstand sieges, rise majestically from the rocky terrain, each stone echoing centuries of history and power. As you approach the chateau, the very journey to its gates is an adventure through time, as you tread the very path that knights and noble ladies once walked, perhaps en route to or returning from the Crusade. Within the chateau's walls, the ambiance is nothing short of awe-inspiring. A tranquil courtyard, surrounded by well-preserved battlements, transports you back to the days when chivalry reigned supreme. The whispers of the wind and the echoing footsteps serve as a haunting reminder of all who have passed through these hallowed halls. Stepping into the chateau's interiors, you are enveloped by a sense of mystery and antiquity. Stone archways lead you into dimly lit chambers where the tapestries tell stories of valor and love, offering a glimpse into the courtly life of the Middle Ages. The great hall, with its vaulted ceilings and colossal hearth, exudes an aura of grandeur that only the noblest of feasts and gatherings could have filled. But it is from the highest tower of the Chateau de Najac that you are truly transported to another world. Ascend the winding staircase to be greeted by a panoramic vista that sweeps across the Aveyron landscape, just as it did when this fortress was both a stronghold and a refuge during its tumultuous history. In every corner of the Chateau de Najac, you can almost hear the echoes of battles won and lost, and the whispers of lovers who once sought refuge in its walls. This medieval masterpiece is more than a monument; it is a living, breathing testament to human history, offering a profound connection to the past that is both emotive and stirring. A visit to the Chateau de Najac is a journey through time, an encounter with the spirits of chivalry, and an opportunity to lose oneself in the enchanting story of France's medieval heritage.",,3646,"{'like_count': 3069, 'comment_count': 37, 'num_users': 64776}",Castles and Medieval times,,2023-10-20 03:19:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/396717962_10229550358450905_2473317658238888866_n.jpg?stp=c0.4.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=itUBmIfA7tYAX-ItQ7L&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBsHZZdh4bvtQPmCNGEnz7-3LUbb4iIc3giiRRJfGUSlQ&oe=655A32A3,https://www.facebook.com/groups/522570995968187/permalink/894521782106438,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394307535_10229509381066496_3621430933361219596_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4lCmNQdhcRUAX9T0FIF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC1U_-JN7MKnLIDI4h-xpCpMNAK7pZlW0etRJCuuxmO9g&oe=65403F79

facebook,"""The World is Too Much With Us"" by William Wordsworth: -> The poem is a sonnet, which means it has 14 lines and follows a specific rhyme scheme and structure. The rhyme scheme is ABBAABBA CDCDCD, which is typical of an Italian or Petrarchan sonnet. The poem is divided into two parts: an octave (the first eight lines) and a sestet (the last six lines). The octave presents the main problem or conflict, while the sestet offers a possible solution or resolution. -> The main problem or conflict that the speaker expresses in the octave is that people are too obsessed with worldly affairs and materialism, and they have lost their connection with nature. The speaker uses words such as ""getting and spending"", ""lay waste our powers"", ""given our hearts away"", and ""sordid boon"" to show his disdain for the greed and consumerism of modern society. He also uses words such as ""little"", ""see"", and ""ours"" to show how people have become blind and alienated from the beauty and value of nature. -> The possible solution or resolution that the speaker suggests in the sestet is that he would rather be a pagan who worships nature gods than a modern person who ignores nature. The speaker uses words such as ""rather"", ""might"", ""glimpses"", and ""less forlorn"" to show his preference and desire for a more natural and spiritual life. He also uses words such as ""Proteus"" and ""Triton"" to refer to ancient Greek sea gods who represent the power and mystery of nature. -> The poem reflects Wordsworth's views on the negative effects of the Industrial Revolution, which was a period of technological and mechanical innovation that transformed British society in the 18th and 19th centuries. Wordsworth was one of the leading figures of the Romantic movement, which emphasized the importance of emotion, imagination, individualism, and nature in art and literature. Wordsworth believed that nature was a source of inspiration, wisdom, and joy, and that people should respect and cherish it. He also criticized the urbanization, industrialization, and commercialization of society, which he thought corrupted human values and degraded natural environments. -> The poem uses various poetic devices to convey its message and mood. Some of these devices are: - Alliteration: the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words, such as ""world"", ""with"", ""waste"", ""winds"", etc. - Personification: the attribution of human qualities to non-human things, such as ""This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon"" or ""The winds that will be howling at all hours"". - Metaphor: a comparison between two unlike things without using like or as, such as ""we have given our hearts away"" or ""we are out of tune"". - Hyperbole: an exaggeration for emphasis or effect, such as ""the world is too much with us"" or ""it moves us not"". - Apostrophe: a direct address to someone or something that is absent or imaginary, such as ""Great God!"" or ""Proteus"" and ""Triton"". - Iambic pentameter: a rhythmic pattern of five pairs of unstressed and stressed syllables per line, such as ""The WORLD / is TOO / much WITH / us; LATE / and SOON"". ______________________________________________________ (Book: 100 Selected Poems https://amzn.to/3SdWrI6:=:https://www.amazon.com/dp/9387779246/ref=tsm_1_fb_lk) #ad #poetry#englishliterature #wordsworth",,3119,"{'like_count': 1740, 'comment_count': 99, 'num_users': 2573513}",English Literature,,2023-10-20 05:17:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/348350303_285870100447355_6450330863822110682_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GoA1g3-9SFwAX-O00en&_nc_oc=AQld2HTFG0hoA8TZ6zyCqORLz9r9suwCd7QDX2t-fX6bwpqCP05TPiC-Eod8Nd_4V5k&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB014Il_t7V0Hssmx936P6n4yhNDEu79ls6RVBrnHChaw&oe=655A7671,https://www.facebook.com/100077522237019/posts/359307386663333,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391661779_359305686663503_973425324463468509_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=M-xC3ZkJYmEAX-62u-2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD-gxyNBGalQxz1tS2lhF5Cr76P5tDp21Y6Wq_8GErzEw&oe=654F6055

facebook,"Big (& Tall) news…we have welcomed a baby giraffe to the Oakland Zoo family. Please say hello to Kendi! Yesterday morning, Kijiji giraffe gave birth to her first calf, Kendi (“loved one” in Swahili.) This amazing little female is approximately 150 lbs and 6.5 feet tall. Kijiji has already demonstrated her loving and protective nature by guiding her baby into the giraffe barn. A separate area has been set up by Keepers in the barn for the Kendi and mama giraffe to bond peacefully. Kendi is expected to remain behind the scenes with the mom for approximately two weeks for mama & calf to develop their relationship. “We’re so excited to have a new baby join the herd. With the expertise of our staff, we’re prepared to assist Kijiji as she enters this stage in life as a new mother” — Amy Phelps, Zoological Manager Kijiji and Kendi will serve as ambassadors, educating guests about their wild giraffe counterparts. By having giraffes at the Zoo, we hope to bring appreciation and awareness to the giraffe species, including the challenges they face in the wild. Oakland Zoo partners with The Reticulated Giraffe Project in Kenya, a conservation organization dedicated to working with local communities in Africa to help reduce human-wildlife conflict and habitat loss to preserve endangered wild giraffe populations. We’ll be sure to let you know how Kendi is doing, and when you can come see them in person. We’re also excited to share that once Kendi makes her public debut on habitat with her mother, we will have a live streaming GiraffeCam for guests and followers! Welcome to the world, little one!

facebook,"Book Title: THE RIVER BETWEEN Author: Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o Lesson: THE NEED FOR TRUE EDUCATION ♦️Intro 👉🏾In the novel, two villages ""Makuyu"" and ""Kameno"" are separated by a river called Honia. 👉🏾This split shows their inner division becoz ✅Village Kameno advocated for African traditions while ✅Village Makuyu accepts Christianity. 👉🏾In fact, the river is where these differences play out: it is where the Traditionalist perform their Circumcisions and the Church perform their Baptisms. 👉🏾So Wayaki , an African man in the novel, is instructed by his father to get an education at the mission school so that he can use it to unite the two villages BUT Wayaki fails to unite the two villages becoz he nolongers knows where to belong...... ♦️Interpretation of the Book 👉🏾 It's funny that the book was written in 1965 but Africa still finds herself in this situation. ☑️Village Kameno which advocates for African traditions represents Africans who still believe in our culture, norms and values that define us as a people. ☑️Village Makuyu which accepts Christianity represents Africans who uphold christian values and consider certain acts in African tradition as evil. ☑️Well, Wayaki who's educated to bring knowledge to his people but fails represents Africans who have been to school but along the way, they have embraced the Muzungu Culture yet still want to be true Africans. ♦️ Explanation or Life Lessons 👉🏾 Any African still finds him or herself in the above situations where our parents or grandparents want us to still pay attention to our culture so that we preserve it as our identity 👉🏾Any African still finds him or herself in situations where we have a conflict whether to go to the church (hospital) or traditional healers when we encounter problems (sickness). 👉🏾Even Upto now the education Africans get doesn't really bring change in their lives becoz 👉🏾 It is based more on theory and less practice so after one graduates, we don't know how to manifest the knowledge we receive into value that we can provide to our communities so that we are paid. ♦️So, we need to acquire an education that will interpret to both the Traditionalist and Church to see the good in both ideologies. 👉🏾A people without their culture lacks identity and a person without identity doesn't know what he or she intends to attain in life 👉🏾A person who ain't God fearing might end up leading an immoral life which can cause harm to oneself.

facebook,"ONLY FOR PASTORS!! 🚨 tag a pastor MINISTERIAL STRESS AND BURNOUT Some few days back, a Pastor was preaching in his church and people were really enjoying the sermon. Then suddenly he froze and had to be rushed to the hospital and died! Another Pastor went to a mountain, proposing to fast for 100 days. He started and on the 31st day of the dry fast, he collapsed, started shaking, could not speak and lost the use of his hands and legs. His sugar level was finished and he is still battling with his health till now. A Pastor was preaching vigorously and suddenly fell down from the pulpit and died there. And another Pastor went for a medical test. He is 50 years old, but the test result showed that his heart is that of an 80 year old! All these are not spiritual attacks, but results of stress, overwork and lack of work-life balance by ministers of the gospel. A. Scriptural Foundation – 1 Kings 19:1-4; 2 Kings 13:14-21 Being a minister is a 24/7 job. Being a Pastor is the toughest job in the whole world. And most ministers are workaholic and work-addict, which results in stress and burnout. Stress is a state/condition of tiredness, weariness, pain in the body, exhaustion, lack of sleep, rest, having emotional issues and obesity – yet you can’t stop, because there is much to do! Here are those things that stress ministers:- ▪ Church stagnation. ▪ Financial pressure. ▪ Pressure to perform. ▪ Crowded programmes. ▪ Elephant projects. ▪ Unrealistic expectations. ▪ Emotional worries. ▪ Problematic members. ▪ Troublesome associates. ▪ Church bills/remittances. ▪ Low attendance. ▪ Problems at the home front. ▪ Superiors’ pressures. ▪ Pulpit manners. Quite sad, that most modern Pastors and ministers are under tremendous stress as a result of these stress-inducing factors. Ministers that juggle all these together will definitely end up stressed and experience burnout. B. The Adverse Effects of Stress And Burnout – 1 Kings 19:1-4; 1 Samuel 13:8-14 Burnout leads to loss of interest, lack of emotion, loss of motivation and possible depression. ✓ Poor health​- stroke, high or low sugar levels. ✓ Family crisis​- separation, divorce and wayward children. ✓ Unresolved conflict​- anger, hurts and terrible words. ✓ Poor performance ​- emotional depletion. ✓ Financial loss ​- debts, losses and poor decision making. Getting angry, stressed up, hurts and becoming irrational are the outcome of stress and burnout. C. Ministry-Life Balance – Matthew 11:28-30 It is vitally important that ministers are able to strike the much needed balance between ministry and living. If truly His yoke is easy, why are ministers experiencing being heavy laden in ministry? It is as a result of lack of balance on our part! A balance minister must have; ▪ Emotional balance. ▪ Mental balance. ▪ Family balance. ▪ Spiritual balance. ▪ Social balance. ▪ Financial balance. ▪ Physical balance. ▪ Psychological balance. If you are not balanced in these areas, then you can’t minister successfully to others. Here are steps to achieve this balance: 1. Re-order your priorities right: God first, family second, ministry last. 2. Eat healthy foods in measures: living foods not dead foods; and not after 6-7pm. 3. Drink alkaline or living waters. 4. Train others and delegate your work. 5. Spend time with your spouse and children. 6. Have peace with God and possess the peace of God – Isaiah 26:34. 7. Negate toxic feelings, thoughts and words. 8. Take healthy breaks to refresh yourself. 9. Take time to seek and wait upon God. 10. Exercise – walk, ride bicycle or stretch. 11. Take time off – vacations, holidays and rest periods. 12. Learn to sleep 7-8 hours night sleep. Catch a nap in the day time. 13. Rest in the Lord to work through you – not you working for Him. It was Robert Murray Mchene who said, “God gave me a horse and a message, now I have killed the horse and could not deliver the message”. He said that on his death bed! He started ministry at 26 years and died at 29 years of age! What a loss! Pastors hear me… if you don’t learn to rest in time, you may have to Rest In Peace very soon!",,1261,"{'like_count': 651, 'comment_count': 184, 'num_users': 131284}",Isaiah Brian Sovi,,2023-10-20 12:20:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/320078842_637460941461143_1546575034984506805_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NeYEekJCIPgAX_CUXhD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBDcCLNC7KQ2ZlHwHgjOElEbUx5Kcc_Gz-WSUlRqDRKAw&oe=655AC685,https://www.facebook.com/100044342560192/posts/902021994619211,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394381740_901786884642722_3439099241485067813_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ugl3VNfGUPAAX_mODWS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDeq1azmxpxkySYS5gD8WQ8gNASz-7CPUHCAGEFMNErmA&oe=65521EE2

facebook,"“As the two regional organizations located astride the major sea gates and vital corridors of the world’s commerce and communications, it is imperative that we work together to promote peace, security and stability in both our regions,” President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. said as he urged fellow leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to uphold rules-based international order to ensure harmony to the rest of the world. The President made these remarks during the ASEAN-GCC Summit in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where he expressed the Philippines’ concern over the recent turmoil in some parts of the world, including the Israel and Gaza conflict. “We hope that all parties will exert their utmost efforts to deescalate the situation, stop all violence and engage in dialogue and diplomacy,” he conveyed, emphasizing the need to establish concrete areas of cooperation and complementary working relationships. Moreover, he welcomed the adoption of the ASEAN-GCC Framework of Cooperation 2024-2028 that will serve as guide for both regional blocs under the political-security, economic and socio-cultural pillars, adding that this document will chart the path forward with greater political will. “The Philippines looks forward to advancing our common interests, particularly on energy and food security, enhancement of logistics and supply chains, the digital economy, and the free and secure flow of goods, people and services that currently underpin an interdependent global economy,” the Chief Executive affirmed. “The Philippines remains strongly committed to support a meaningful partnership with GCC countries for peace in our regions and the prosperity of our peoples,” President Marcos Jr. concluded in his intervention.",,1212,"{'like_count': 690, 'comment_count': 40, 'num_users': 497545}",Radio Television Malacañang - RTVM,,2023-10-20 12:41:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242752604_232099998957363_5867204315811603150_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=H-sJzshk9aEAX9oeqHg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD9N0UXvpstwApCCx2JuKCG5sbf7DennaJLSiFG3yzXpQ&oe=655A41C8,https://www.facebook.com/100064720927568/posts/746932957474062,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/394466617_852464692988029_1580691620482833761_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=FUB9eRKAqZcAX-n30u_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDpa38GUlA2b8sl9JyucZmjtRE69adJ3eDMMz9SMl6MGw&oe=65380D94

facebook,"Look for the Helpers (Always) “When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.” Fred Rogers Our world is a scary place right now for many. The suffering in the Holy Land is sobering, distressing and depressing. It has been a complicated place with complex solutions for a long time. Misunderstanding, discord, injustice, violence, oppression, and hatred seem to be threatening, if not overtaking the more human, humane and spiritual values of justice, understanding, peace, reconciliation, and love. I’ve traveled there four times, studied in Jerusalem and throughout the land for two months, and led a pilgrimage, with plans to lead many more. Hearing the stories of the people of the land will transform you. Listening will obliterate your prejudices and soften your heart as well as strengthen your will to be part of the solution. Right now, no one seems to be in the mood to listen, to understand, to find a solution other than retribution and doing harm to one's enemy. But such violence is not only contrary to the core values of all religions, it simply makes things worse. What Jesus said is true: “Those who live by the sword (insert modern weapon of choice) will die by the sword.” Yet, every day more and more innocent victims are harmed, maimed or killed. What should we do, other than pray? I’d say Mr. Rogers’ advice is more wise than anything I’ve heard any political leader espouse lately: Look for the helpers. On every trip to the Holy Land, the biggest blessing has been meeting helpers, those folks who are working hard to bring people together and find real solutions to the conflict and discord. Although you won’t read about many of them in the news, regardless of your source, they are there. And they are still working on the right (and righteous things) against the odds. One helper whose legacy continues today is Henrietta Szold, founder of the Jewish Women’s Organization Hadassah. You may know that Hadassah Hospital just outside Jerusalem continues to serve as a model of healing and co-existence, “making broken lives whole and giving hope where there is none.” Another helper is Suhaila Tarazi, the Director of the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza. This hospital, I’m proud to say, is a ministry of my own religious tradition, the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem. It’s a small group of people with extraordinarily large hearts. They have helpers throughout the Middle East working to heal, educate, reconcile, and train – whatever it takes to help people become more whole – just what our loving God intends for ALL people. There are so many more helpers I could point to in the Holy Land – some are Christian, some are Jewish, some are Muslim. Some are ministries of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem but many others are not. The Parent’s Circle is one, in particular, that has inspired me for many years. These helpers give me hope when it’s so easy to have none. Look for the helpers. And when you find them, help them. In helping them, we are helping God, who is very proud of each of them I’m sure. Did I just sound like Mr. Rogers? If so, then I must be doing something right. William B. “Father Bill” Miller is an Episcopal priest and writer living in Round Top, Texas. He is the author of three inspirational books. He and his wife Sandy rescue dogs, pastor a church, and lead pilgrimages to the Holy Land. They try to support as many helpers as they can.",,1172,"{'like_count': 710, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 11548}",William Miller,,2023-10-20 21:46:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/157599614_156625519617612_5332798641744734220_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=2QkWRrtfS0wAX_tERnA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCeFE-Catf-8rkTfjEytvafz2uHuUM40WHq4mpYB21HHA&oe=657D4AD2,https://www.facebook.com/100058104938848/posts/729449769001848,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391645413_729449725668519_314803866241663470_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ri95Vg4hDMYAX8R936d&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAYle98Az5Wf3QWrn5xK82hgM82zuGIfFQFk9237RUTOg&oe=654F8C3D

In my brief remarks referring to the crisis in Gaza, I stated Timor-Leste alignment with the ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS’ STATEMENT ON THE RECENT ESCALATION OF ARMED CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST 20 OCTOBER 2023 1. We, the Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), are gravely concerned over the recent escalation of armed conflicts in the Middle East. We urge for the immediate end of violence to avoid further human casualties and call for the full respect of International Humanitarian Law. We call on all parties to create safe, rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian corridors. 2. We strongly condemn the acts of violence which have led to the deaths and injury of civilians, including ASEAN nationals. We reaffirm our support for a negotiated two-State solution that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side in peace and security consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. This will be the only viable path to resolving the root cause of the conflict. 3. We further call on all parties to protect and ensure safety and security to all civilians, including ASEAN nationals, and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. We re-emphasize our commitment to provide emergency assistance to ASEAN nationals, in accordance with the ASEAN Declaration on the Guidelines on Consular Assistance by ASEAN Member States’ Missions in Third Countries to Nationals of Other ASEAN Member State and the Guidelines for the Provision of Emergency Assistance by ASEAN Missions in Third Countries to Nationals of ASEAN Member Countries in Crisis Situations. 4. We urge the international community to support the peace process in order to ensure long lasting peace and stability in the region. 5.

facebook,"FOOD FOR THOUGHT- For a small amount of perspective at this moment, imagine you were born in 1900. When you are 14, World War I starts, and ends on your 18th birthday with 22 million people killed. Later in the year, a Spanish Flu epidemic hits the planet and runs until you are 20. Fifty million people die from it in those two years. Yes, 50 million. When you're 29, the Great Depression begins. Unemployment hits 25%, global GDP drops 27%. That runs until you are 33. The country nearly collapses along with the world economy. When you turn 39, World War II starts. You aren’t even over the hill yet. When you're 41, the United States is fully pulled into WWII. Between your 39th and 45th birthday, 75 million people perish in the war and the Holocaust kills six million. At 52, the Korean War starts and five million perish. At 64 the Vietnam War begins, and it doesn’t end for many years. Four million people die in that conflict. Approaching your 62nd birthday you have the Cuban Missile Crisis, a tipping point in the Cold War. Life on our planet, as we know it, could well have ended. Great leaders prevented that from happening. As you turn 75, the Vietnam War finally ends. Think of everyone on the planet born in 1900. How do you survive all of that? A kid in 1985 didn’t think their 85 year old grandparent understood how hard school was. Yet those grandparents (and now great grandparents) survived through everything listed above. Perspective is an amazing art. Let’s try and keep things in perspective. Let’s be smart, help each other out, and we will get through all of this.

facebook,"Amid the escalating violence in the Israel-Gaza conflict, the blame game on the international stage is intensifying. The recent U.S. veto of a UN resolution calling for a cease-fire illuminated America's stance, with the U.S. Ambassador delineating a clear line of blame towards Hamas for the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. In a detailed address, the U.S. Ambassador mourned the tragic loss of life from the explosion at the Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital in Gaza, expressing horror and sadness. Yet, the narrative swiftly pivoted to lay blame when the ambassador stated, 'Let's be clear. Hamas's own actions have brought this on — this severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Hamas has caused so much needless suffering, death, and destruction.' The U.S. viewpoint reiterating Israel's right to self-defense has drawn criticism from various quarters, pointing to the stark power disparity between Israel and Gaza, and the devastating toll on civilian life the conflict continues to take. The unfolding narrative of blame, critics argue, overshadows the humanitarian imperative to alleviate the suffering of those caught in the crossfire.",,910,"{'like_count': 135, 'comment_count': 339, 'num_users': 18121183}",NowThis,,2023-10-20 00:30:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/355356795_639771204853708_8635820077350552682_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=FRSfOtMtmIcAX8tGMnS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBLKD_eMEHnCBN5cb0-6v-Ac1IPAQERtWMblCA-wTAWhw&oe=655A41E6,https://www.facebook.com/100064625024524/posts/705224508308377,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393877253_1031555904626633_2668620587473295344_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=gNh1gzl_JlIAX8p6-gk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDLRLDAQuHZU0HROiBnxb31gyqPbqzbsD6f6RdFf9eoSw&oe=654467B4
facebook,"The recent conflict in Israel and Palestine is, for me, a stark reminder of the fragility of peaceful social and religious relationships, and how we should strive to keep politics separate from these as much as possible. I do not take the socioreligious harmony we have here for granted, so when I can, I try to do my very small part by participating in various religious festivals and celebrations. So I was honored last week to attend Zhun Ti Tang’s Nine Emperor Gods’ Ceremony, held at #Rivervale, in lieu of my colleague Chua Kheng Wee 蔡庆威 (who was traveling). The proceedings lasted a good few hours, during which I learned about the origins of the various practices, including the lighting of nine lamps (one for each deity), the invitation to visit from the water, and the prop that accompanies the sedan procession. I am neither Taoist nor Buddhist, the two groups that (in Singapore) celebrate the festival. Nevertheless, I believe that the respect we confer on others’ exercise of their faith—especially when they take the effort to invite you to partake in something so special to them—is more important than the need to strictly adhere to one’s own religious norms. It is for this reason that, when I visit a wake, I am willing to light incense; I believe, after all, that I am honoring those not only those that have passed, but also those who remain and are in mourning. My thanks to the organizers for the invitation, and I wish them and all devotees a meaningful period of prayer and reflection for the remainder of the festival.",,908,"{'like_count': 798, 'comment_count': 56, 'num_users': 90707}",Jamus Lim,,2023-10-20 00:18:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/211873206_321680306280566_5485224045707527505_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=oZ0-_knqybkAX810oZa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCrAFYcJAOG9F80aIam4YaTd6o5fMZYhrFQVwebCYsMzA&oe=657D3F1B,https://www.facebook.com/100053157969016/posts/850372763411315,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393755264_850372876744637_3834349049406727231_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=w0dUPd45VL4AX_75xKK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDibcdvmt1x5nPLLU2tz-N3rQ-vzpq9OoxacFTjcmEBEA&oe=65376969

facebook,"Oct 22, Sun 1st Reading: Isaiah 45:1, 4–6 Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and to loose the belts of kings, to open doors before him that gates may not be closed: For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I name you, though you do not know me. I am the Lord, and there is no other, besides me there is no God; I equip you, though you do not know me, that people may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is none besides me; I am the Lord, and there is no other. Psalm 96:1 and 3, 4–5,7–8, 9–10a, and c Response: Give the Lord glory and power. O sing a new song to the Lord; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Tell among the nations his glory, and his wonders among all the peoples. Response: Give the Lord glory and power. For the Lord is great and highly to be praised, to be feared above all gods. For the gods of the nations are naught. It was the Lord who made the heavens. Response: Give the Lord glory and power. Give the Lord, you families of peoples, give the Lord glory and power; give the Lord the glory of his name. Bring an offering and enter his courts. Response: Give the Lord glory and power. Worship the Lord in holy splendour. O tremble before him, all the earth. Say to the nations, “The Lord is king.” he will judge the peoples in fairness. Response: Give the Lord glory and power. 2nd Reading: 1 Thessalonians 1:1–5b Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labour of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. Acclamation: You shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life. Gospel: Matthew 22:15–21 At that time: The Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle Jesus in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone’s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” Reflection: Although the Pharisees are primarily a religious group, they are also political nationalists who resent paying taxes to the emperor and oppose all attempts by the Romans to interfere with the Jewish way of life. The Herodians, on the other hand, are a political group who support Herod Antipas and the Romans, and are open to making changes ordered by the Romans. These opposing camps, setting aside their ideological differences, conspire to discredit Jesus and if possible to eliminate Him, their common enemy. The different Christian communities today, divided on the basis of language, caste, race, beliefs and rites, can draw positive lessons from this. Since all Christians are united by the common thread of faith in Christ, they should strive, albeit their differences, to foster unity and cooperation among themselves because, as Pope Francis exhorts, “Unity is always higher than conflict.” @Sacred Heart of Jesus @Mother of Perpetual Help @Mother Teresa @Mother Mary @CHRIST JESUS @PRAYERS @Divine Mercy @St. Anthony of Padua @INFANT JESUS @Roman Catholic Church @Catholics @Jesus @Holy Rosary @Sacred Heart of Jesus @Holy Spirit https://www.instagram.com/invites/contact/?i=qu7lfnjvfs3n&utm_content=ml16jhg:=:https://instagram.com/ https://www.instagram.com/sacredheartofjesus_:=:https://www.instagram.com/sacredheartofjesus_/ https://youtube.com/channel/UCLs5i5cWiHJP6QMkk7g3_Ow:=:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLs5i5cWiHJP6QMkk7g3_Ow",,899,"{'like_count': 343, 'comment_count': 119, 'num_users': 135115}",Sacred Heart of Jesus,,2023-10-20 19:30:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/308840982_193104003094388_5766580828863679391_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=PhqZXtgWLiwAX8dIJxV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDwVqcDJ-faI1mIo6JHZCMuwh7NLeltnUZuqGn4mfZwKQ&oe=655B924F,https://www.facebook.com/100071843689567/posts/345033701234750,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391642673_344316681306452_1856915691507892737_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rvOLeJy5DJ4AX-q6mS6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDtvFUTN7kzLRMvvtyC6LrStpt95lOVlnF1rFp7yIjYeA&oe=65386862

To world leaders grant the wisdom to see beyond the boundaries of race, religion, and nation to that common humanity that makes us all your children and brothers and sisters to one another. To those who have taken up arms in anger or revenge or even in the cause of justice grant the grace of conversion to the path of peaceful dialogue and constructive collaboration. To the innocent who live in the shadow of war and terror, especially the frightened children, be a shelter and strength, their haven and hope. And to those who have already lost their lives as victims of human cruelty and chemical warfare, open wide your arms and enfold them all in the embrace of your compassion, healing, and everlasting life.

facebook,"ADEBIMPE 09 Written by @faith stories ✍️ DO NOT COPY OR REPOST WITHOUT MY CONSENT. Adebimpe spent two weeks at the hospital due to the illness. She was unable to do anything, it was Josiah and Mr Charles that do come often to check on her to the extent Josiah almost had a clash with Mr Charles because of how he do visit Adebimpe. The doctor gave her some medication to be taking while at home. The cause of what happened to her wasn’t detected because it looks strange. Her body looks so rough like chicken pox growth from the skin. But thankfully the treatment she was given helped her to regain strength. She was told not to stress herself in anyway in other not to make it worse, the doctor said it looks more like spiritual and it’s by God’s grace that she survived it. All along she definitely knew the de vil in her house that would have wanted her dea d. She has no other thoughts than Faridah. She’s the only one who has been having conflict with her in the house. She has no choice than to call her daughter and informed her about her circumstances. Adesewa didn’t hesitate before returning back home because of what her mother said. “My dear, please help me with that herbs.” She said to her daughter who sat at the chair opposite her. She gave her the herbs to drink and she thanked her. “Mother, what should I prepare for you?.” She asked her mother. “Don’t worry oko mí (my darling) I will let you know when I’m hungry and moreover I can’t even wait to bounce back to my normal self so that you can return to your school.” She said. “Noo na mother, your health is my first priority. If you’re well, my school is nothing to be worried about. My prayer is for you to get better.” She answered. She smiles and told her to come closer as she peck her forehead. “You are a darling and I love you so much.” She said smiling. “I love you more mother, you’re the best in The whole world!.” She answered and laughed. Someone knock at the door and Adesewa opened it for Nkechi to enter. “How are you feeling now mama sewa?.” She asked sitting on the chair. “I am fine oo mama Chinedu, thank you so much for your care and I’m really grateful.” “It’s okay (smiling) what are we family for if not to help each other.” She said. I brought this medication soup for you and I’m very sure it will help also.” “Thank you mama Chinedu may God bless you for me.” Adebimpe said. “Amen ooo ehn’ I even want to tell you something but I don’t want Adesewa to be here.” She said and Adebimpe order sewa to excuse them. “So, what is it?.” She asked wondering what she’s about to say. “You see something mama sewa, I have wanted to this ooo but I don’t know how you might react to it.” “Please say it. I might learn one or two things from it.” Adebimpe answered as she drink the soup she brought. “It Is about this thing that happened to you, because if by looking at things. Mama Rihannat behavior looks so glaring about what might be going on in this house. And you know how she has been behaving with us in this house.” She said trying to manipulate her mind to fight with faridah. “Thank you! I know, I know that she’s the one behind my predicament. Can’t you see how she feels less concerned about what happened to me? I have been wishing for my quick recovery so that I can deal with her very well. Just leave her ooo ….” “Ehn’ehn!.” Nkechi shouted. “She will tell me what I buy from her that she want to ki ll me before my time. She has forgotten God doesn’t prosper the handwork of the enemy, she thinks she can hunt me down Never! I say Never!! Mama Chinedu. I will deal with her ehn infact she will turn to air that can’t be seen again by the time I squeezed the hell out of her! .” “very good! I will support you mama sewa! I think that day will be her last day in this house. A senior wife that can’t respect herself instead of fighting her junior to the extent of casting spell ha! Mama sewa that’s just too much! If is me ehn I will break her into pieces, even if our husband tried to separate us, he will also be dealt with.” Nkechi said in annoyance. “Just don’t worry, at least I’m getting better already. Common to show concern, she didn’t . I know she might be plotting another way to get me, but my God is bigger than her. She will see!.” Adebimpe said aggressively, that one could even see her veins in line of her vibration. Nkechi told her to calm down but within her she was really happy that she is able to achieve what she wanted. “I hope you’re hearing from your boss? Mr charms or is it Charles.” Nkechi asked making Adebimpe to laugh. “It is Charles ooo marma Chinedu. Well, he called me this morning but I just lied to him that I’m already fine .” She answered. “Ehya!.” Nkechi said while wondering in her mind on why he would still be calling her when her husband has warned him to abstain from Adebimpe. And the man is nice oooo.” She said beaming. “Yes oo and he has been wonderful, I won’t lie.” Adebimpe said. “And he is married.” Nkechi asked smirking.” “Of (truncated)",,844,"{'like_count': 678, 'comment_count': 78, 'num_users': 90740}",Faith stories,,2023-10-20 06:28:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/401382500_307846265344811_7605000216979340158_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=KomzzRKIOYIAX_MnSQX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBTzYYr25qH3y_kBiaxD7W_N4YfB1gZDSukxqDRntlAeQ&oe=655A99BC,https://www.facebook.com/100083583182170/posts/295313663264738,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394190399_295313633264741_2166722625297229080_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IQJc_etowMcAX_5u5zC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDRAnolHerwWd-nniLJ0ntmjdcj2SF8x_XuayqWwyIzaA&oe=65384997
facebook,"Ik geloof dat ‘wereldvrede’ een taak is voor ons allemaal. Vrede is méér dan de afwezigheid van oorlog. Het is elkaar vinden waar verschil is. Het is liefde durven kiezen boven angst. Ieder mens draagt de kans op vrede in zich. Je kunt elk moment beginnen. Door vrede te sluiten met wie je zelf ten diepste bent. Door vrede te sluiten met je verleden en je systeem, je angsten en je pijn, je vergissingen en je verlangens. Door liefdevol te kijken, naar jezelf en anderen. Geen conflict toe te voegen waar het niet is. Te vergeven waar het wel is. Vrede betekent niet dat we allemaal hetzelfde moeten zijn; het betekent met liefde kijken naar het verschil. Ik geloof dat we dat kunnen. Misschien wel dat we het verplicht zijn aan onze kinderen om het in elk geval te proberen.

facebook,"This beautiful memory popped up today. A beautiful capture from our good friend Joshua Able Photographer. For those that don't know her this is Big T from the Lamar Canyon Pack. She was born in April of 2014, her Mother was our Beloved Queen 926F, and her Father 925M, who sacrificed his own life in a conflict with a rival Pack in 2015 to save his mate 926F, Big T, her siblings, and unborn pups that 926F was carrying. Big T is also the Granddaughter of our namesake The ""06"" Female and her Grandfather was our Silver King 755M. Big T got her nickname because of the big white triangle she had on her chest, just as her sister Little T because her white triangle was little. Some wolves aren't collared so photographers and wolf watchers give wolves nicknames so they can identify them when seen. In 2016 The Lamar Canyon Pack had a bad case of mange, some wolves in the pack with just a little bit, while others in the pack had it worse. Big T was one that had very bad mange, she had dispersed a few times from the Pack, and was never seen again. It's more than likely she died from the mange especially if she was alone, it takes a lot of strength and nutrition to heal from mange and would be hard for her to hunt. But we will never know what really happened to Big T. For me it's harder to not know what has happened to a wolf compared to actually knowing what happened to them. I hope wherever Big T's final resting place was that she is now at Peace. Thank you again Joshua Able, Photographer for this beautiful memory of Big T in Soda Butte Valley. She was a beautiful soul and she will be forever in my heart.. Legends Never Die... Goodnight and Sweet Dreams Everyone, see you all tomorrow in the Valley of Wolves, where Spirits run free and if you listen closely you can hear their Howls echo in the wind...💜💜💜 ~ Bev and The 06 Legacy Crew #HowlForLife #RelistWolves #RelistWolvesNow #BeAWolfWarrior",,805,"{'like_count': 439, 'comment_count': 50, 'num_users': 219711}",The 06 Legacy,,2023-10-20 02:21:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/333822428_117224084516465_9098582946725624998_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=JEl1AOTjTi0AX_P1m7e&_nc_oc=AQnpdmFLmcXWLsoHGFfz1J51NmNjzV-tdnfNAtXdjMI7RCjGl5VBYLApbny6y_vi9WA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCRSP8bn0h8oWjgDNe4DvwKMxkKsN1Gro0mSN5Rd1wvCg&oe=655B446D,https://www.facebook.com/100064862223748/posts/742886104550124,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394220487_742881267883941_243412354416599792_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=s7xZN1pp_LAAX_MKRkg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCj74fupsKHCY8o-1Kzb5gV3-83mF7inD-dW9rQEYSzcA&oe=65590DB0

facebook,"It's Wolf Awareness Week and what a special memory to share with you today. Every Wolf has a story and this is the story of a Wolf They Called Uncle Mottled.. When I think of this wolf, it makes my heart smile, he was one of those wolves that made his way into your heart and forever stayed in it. Mottled was from the Prospect Peak Pack, he and his 3 brothers were involved in the death of Lamar Canyon Pack Alpha Male 925M, and came calling on 926F one day. 926F had major decisions to make, she either raises her pups and unborn pups alone or she tries to recruit these males that came calling. 926F faced these Males head on and started wagging her tail to show her friendly side, it worked, she won these males over and accepted them into her Pack. Twin became her Alpha male and Mottled became the Beta. Mottled took his Beta position very seriously. The six eleven month old pups left the pack for some time on a walk about through the park, 926F had per pups with the help of the Males. Five pups were born and became the Legacy Five Pups. Mottled treated those pups as if they were his very own, he played with them, protected them, feed them and sang his songs to them, he became Uncle Mottled. On several occasions Uncle Mottled proved his loyalty to 926F and the pups. When the Mollie Pack came into Lamar territory Uncle Mottled sprung into action to protect the pups, he was chased by the Mollie Alpha Female leading her away from the pups, he got several bites but he was ok and returned to the Pack. Another time the Wolf Project was out in the red helicopter collaring wolves, they saw Uncle Mottled and I can still remember the video I saw at the time, the helicopter was chasing him but Uncle Mottled was having none of that and he ran so fast away from the chopper, he ran toward the pups to make sure they were ok while his brothers Dark Black and the Alpha Twin got collared. Uncle Mottled went into Alpha mode, the Beta's of the Pack will do this until the Alpha Male returns. Uncle Mottled escaped getting collared that day. Uncle Mottled sang many songs and one of his songs was ""don't cross the road there's monsters on it"", it was a song Uncle Mottled sang a lot, he did not like the roads, the cars or the people. When the rest of the pack would cross the roads and Uncle Mottled wasn't sure about crossing he would sing his song, and Alpha Male Twin would come and get Uncle Mottled and cross the road with him, the pups also learned Uncle Mottled's songs. During 2016 The Lamar Canyon Pack went through many hardships and losses, it was really a rough year. One day the Junction Butte Pack came calling on the Lamar's and all hell broke lose. The Lamar Canyon Pack was separated and Uncle Mottled put his life in jeopardy to save the pups. That was the last time Uncle Mottled was ever seen. The next day the Wolf Project hiked up to where the conflict happened but no sign of Uncle Mottled anywhere. It is presumed that Uncle Mottled died that day sacrificing his life to save the pups he loved so much. I have always thought in my heart that Uncle Mottled was still alive somewhere, they never found his body, he just disappeared and in the Wolf World anything is possible. Uncle Mottled will always have a special place in my heart, he loved his Lamar family so much and they all loved him. At first I didn't know if I would even like these Males considering that they were responsible for 925M's death, but to love wolves and to be a Voice and Advocate for them you have to take the good with the bad, I realized that 925M was trying to protect his family and Uncle Mottled and his brothers were trying to protect their territory, they each did what wolves are suppose to do. Uncle Mottled was a Beautiful Soul and will always be loved and missed.

facebook,"An estimated 5,000 worshippers gathered at Parry Park Lakemba earlier this afternoon to offer their Jumu'ah prayer for the people of Palestine. The event was put together by the LMA in collaboration with a number of other masjids and religious organisations in light of the recent conflict in Gaza. The LMA took the almost unprecedented step of moving Jumu’ah from our iconic Lakemba Mosque to nearby Parry Park to cater for the anticipated huge crowd and our expectations were well and truly met. Lakemba Mosque Imam Sheikh Yahya Safi (Arabic) and Sheikh Wesam Charkawi (English) delivered the khutbahs and spoke passionately about the oppression being suffered by our Palestinian brothers and sisters at the hands of the tyrants. Their words were eloquently supported by our other speakers Abraham Zoabi, Sheikh Ahmed Abdo and Siddiq Buckley. A sincere thank you to our community for their attendance today and for their exceptional generosity as a substantial amount was raised by our charity arm Feed The World.

They are hardly in agreement. The brain contradicts the heart and the heart, in turn, negates the brain. One works on rational and the other is guided by emotions. All our decisions are guided by either of the two. We must know which to use and when. Wisdom helps. And this wisdom is gained at the lotus feet of Sai. When we trust fully, Sai helps us take the right decisions at the right time. Just follow your instincts that are ignited by Sai. He will never let us go wrong.

facebook,"Here are 8 powerful lessons from the book Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don't Know 1.We have a default to truth. This means that we assume that the people we are talking to are honest. This is a good thing in general, but it can make us vulnerable to deception. 2.We are bad at detecting liars. Studies have shown that people are only about 50/50 at detecting whether someone is lying. This is because it is very difficult to tell whether someone is lying based on their body language or facial expressions. 3.We are susceptible to confirmation bias. This means that we tend to seek out and interpret information in a way that confirms our existing beliefs. This can make it difficult to have objective conversations with people who have different beliefs than us. 4.We are prone to misattribution of blame. This means that we tend to blame people for things that are beyond their control. For example, if a police officer shoots an unarmed person, we may blame the police officer for being racist or trigger-happy. However, it is important to remember that people are often acting in ways that they believe are necessary, even if those actions are harmful. 5.We are susceptible to the coupling effect. This means that we tend to judge a person's actions based on our understanding of their character. For example, if we believe that someone is a good person, we are more likely to excuse their bad behavior. 6.We are bad at understanding people from different cultures. This is because we tend to project our own cultural values and assumptions onto others. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. 7.We are susceptible to the power of belief. This means that our beliefs can have a powerful impact on our behavior. For example, if we believe that we are going to fail at a task, we are more likely to fail. 8.We need to be humble about our ability to understand strangers. We should always be open to the possibility that we are wrong about someone, and we should be willing to listen to their perspective. These are just a few of the many powerful lessons that can be learned from Malcolm Gladwell's book Talking to Strangers. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to better understand the challenges and opportunities of interacting with strangers.

facebook,"Hi there (name deleted). Thanks for your comment on our post which, for the record, had no direct or indirect link to the Middle East conflict. At all. We weren't aware that world leaders were waiting to hear the opinion of a medium-sized, political-satire FB page on the other side of the planet. But for what it's worth, sure why not, here’s our view. Hamas should probably set the Israeli kids free. And Israel should stop bombing Palestine, occupying land, destroying homes, and killing innocent citizens. The UK, Europe and others should stop selling weapons to both sides. The Russians, US and Chinese should stop having proxy wars in the Middle East, and Africa and the Pacific ….) Politicians should stop using tragic, complicated conflict in the Middle East to score cheap, cynical, political points with domestic audiences. Media companies should stop platforming extremists with extreme views to fuel discord and drive online engagement. And while we are here: • unless you're in the top 1%, capitalism kind of sucks • there is one, top-to-bottom, worldwide conspiracy, it’s called misogyny - ask any woman • we all need to stop digging up and burning shit because it’s literally killing us. Hope that helps, Thanks again for asking. ^ [sArCaSm FoNt] One of Britain’s greatest ever funny folk, Peter Cook described political satire as being a bit like those 'wonderful Berlin cabarets which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the Second World War'.",,501,"{'like_count': 303, 'comment_count': 56, 'num_users': 91357}",PrimeChinister,,2023-10-20 01:10:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/395484074_891023025716704_9161760556734060220_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=9RfIIhe-xfEAX8DE4Ug&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC6YMmf5CWyGHTwZc-shZhvnFStkU959nfCFU0auQbv1g&oe=655B7308,https://www.facebook.com/100044270447759/posts/886836519468688,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393827897_886835332802140_7458029421601196656_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NV0k23JUmJQAX95zcxY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD_yUlDP7sZ7HgP3wZBUCSd9aDsyB4yGEXOxiW5RYCVvA&oe=65547BEF
facebook,"Until this week, Josh Paul wasn’t well known beyond diplomatic and military circles. He’d worked at the State Department for more than 11 years, focusing heavily on the issue of arms transfers to other countries. He’d watched as the U.S. sent weapons to many troublesome regimes, but he thought his input helped keep the system from thoughtless overreach. The U.S. rush to arm Israel in its battle against Hamas militants was a breaking point for Paul. The 45-year-old made waves when he quit his job in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and posted a resignation letter that he said resonated with many inside the State Department. In it, he condemned the Hamas attack as a “monstrosity” but wrote that he believes Israel’s military response will only lead to more and greater suffering. We interviewed Paul, who studied the Israeli-Palestinian conflict academically – he wrote his master’s thesis on Israeli counterterrorism and civil rights. He has also lived in the West Bank. In a conversation with @politicomag, Paul laid out why he thinks the U.S. approach to this war is wrongheaded and why Israel should pursue options beyond an invasion of the Gaza Strip. He even read some excerpts of the emails he sent to his former superiors.

facebook,"Buffalo Bill Cody and Sitting Bull (Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake). When people think of Buffalo Bill Cody, they often get caught up on two historical fallacies. The first is that Bill Cody was a horrific slaughterer of the American bison, otherwise known as the buffalo. The second is that his participation in the near-extermination event of the buffalo was driven by genocidal urges and federal dollars to deny Native American tribes their primary food source in hopes of eliminating them entirely. I see this interpretation of Cody's buffalo hunting days a lot, but I don't believe it is entirely accurate. William F. Cody hunted bison to feed the westward expansion of the railroad, but only for about 18 months. By the end of 1869, he worked full-time as a scout for the Army at Fort McPherson. During those 18 months, he earned a reputation as a great buffalo hunter, but he didn’t stand on a distant hill with a high-powered rifle and a looking glass, picking off docile creatures with no danger to himself. Bill Cody hunted the same way the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Pawnee did. He rode his horse towards a herd, separated the animal he would harvest, and ran alongside it until he could get the best shot possible. Cody killed a few animals at a time and brought them back to be used to feed the men working on expanding the railroad west. Despite what many think, he was never a hide hunter and never slaughtered buffalo indiscriminately for either the choice cuts (tongue and loin) or their hides. By 1873, when desperate economic times made hide hunting more attractive, Buffalo Bill and Texas Jack had left the prairies of Nebraska and the herds of buffalo that roamed it behind to become successful (and quite wealthy) actors. They would occasionally return west to hunt but were never again a significant factor in the decline of the bison. As part of his job as a scout, Buffalo Bill was involved with several altercations with Miniconjou, Lakota, Brule, Cheyenne, etc. Still, he never set out to murder Native Americans or to eliminate the bison, the staple of their diet, directly. That said, Bill Cody did kill multiple Native American men in conflict, and those incidents, especially his combat with and killing of Yellow Hair, were inflated and magnified in dime novels and on stage. He became a legendary ""Indian fighter"" more because of the legend than the reality. Cody, like the Native people he fought against, knew that when they went to war someone was going to kill and someone was going to be killed. Each man fought desperately to ensure that he was the former, and though they were enemies, each man held a measure of respect for his adversary. Likewise, Texas Jack was involved in conflicts with Sioux, Cheyenne, and Comanche warriors and developed a reputation as an ""Indian fighter"" despite having warm relations with the Pawnee tribe, joining them on their summer buffalo hunt in 1872, writing warmly about them in national publications, and being requested personally to join them by Pawnee head chief Pitaresaru (Chief of Men). Texas Jack also involved Cayuse native Donald McKay and his wife and daughter in his show well before Buffalo Bill ever brought Sioux into his Wild West shows. Whatever failing Cody exhibited in his younger life in regard to Native Americans must be contrasted with his later life. His inclusion of Lakota in his Wild West show, including Sitting Bull himself, allowed them to travel, but more importantly, to maintain and display their ceremonial dances and customs at a time when they were prevented by the United States government and Army from holding their religious ceremonies on the reservations. Cody paid the Native men and women in his show the same as he did the white cowboys, treated them fairly, kept families together, and was regarded as a warm friend by a great many of the Lakota that traveled with him. Over time, Buffalo Bill Cody became a stalwart advocate for Native peoples and their rights. In the same way, Cody’s inclusion of the bison in his Wild West shows made sure that spectators at the shows were endeared to the animals. Over time, they became a symbol of not just the Wild West, but of America writ large. Because the hundreds of thousands of people who saw the bison in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West now cared about the animals, they supported conservation movements that brought them back from the brink of extinction. The man who earned his name as a buffalo hunter became one of the primary forces in their survival. Cody publicly blamed most of the trouble between white men and Native tribes on the white men. He said that: ""In nine cases out of ten where there is trouble between white men and Indians, it will be found that the white man is responsible Indians expect a man to keep his word. They can't understand how a man can lie."" Dr. George Kingsley, who hunted with Cody and Omohundro, wrote that “[Buffalo Bill and Texas Jack] have a sympathy and a tenderness toward the Indians infinitely (truncated)",,478,"{'like_count': 419, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 46005}",Native American Blood,,2023-10-20 15:25:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/362898878_585264263814919_4065340533119404895_n.jpg?stp=c21.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y98iMy_z_FwAX-HBPab&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCekx28anPnUAd1bS5uK3Ij6jW3aSjnuoaXjRaxxQ2A3Q&oe=655BB098,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1378608446282758/permalink/1554069062070028,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394516572_1736452480154096_3520094454957656051_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GYf2TdmA6jIAX_PRdlM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC0gMX1bogE_9B3hX3lPZfWti8arJi8q5fV_v2ndnr7Yw&oe=65386FA3

facebook,"In interpersonal relations, a proxy conflict refers to a situation where two individuals or groups are involved in a conflict that is not directly related to the issue at hand but is instead influenced or fueled by external factors or hidden agendas. In other words, it is a conflict that is fought indirectly through someone else or through unrelated issues. Here's an example to illustrate this concept: Let's say there are two coworkers, Alice and Bob, who have a strained relationship. The root cause of their conflict might be a disagreement over a work-related project. However, rather than addressing the project issue directly, Alice and Bob start using proxy tactics. They may involve other colleagues, spread rumors, or manipulate situations to gain support or undermine each other's reputation. In this case, the conflict between Alice and Bob becomes a proxy conflict because it is being fought through third parties or by diverting attention to unrelated matters. The actual disagreements and tensions are displaced onto others, creating a web of indirect conflicts. Proxy conflicts often arise due to underlying dynamics such as power struggles, personal insecurities, or past grievances. Individuals may use proxy tactics to save face, manipulate perceptions, or avoid direct confrontation. However, these tactics can create further misunderstandings, escalate tensions, and hinder the resolution of the original conflict. Recognizing a proxy conflict is important in order to address the core issues and find constructive ways to resolve the conflict. By identifying the hidden agendas, understanding the underlying emotions, and encouraging open communication, individuals can work towards resolving conflicts more effectively and promoting healthier interpersonal relationships.",,468,"{'like_count': 239, 'comment_count': 32, 'num_users': 336911}",Conscious Lee,,2023-10-20 00:23:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/320765454_721161212702424_731028478629252023_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eB-Tb3tmhRUAX-bx7tW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAr_m3_sUGycG_MFgaXssJs1YvE9i6S62HDHxnpTZvjRQ&oe=655A1658,https://www.facebook.com/100063746558947/posts/831986298936248,

FRANCOIS TÔ THỊ ÁNH (DÒNG ĐỨC BÀ: CONGRÉGATION NOTRE DAME - C.N.D)** > Nữ tu dòng Đức Bà - Sơ Tô Thị Ánh là nữ Tiến sĩ trị liệu tâm lý đầu tiên của Việt Nam. Bà là một học trò của Carl Rogers – người sáng lập trường phái trị liệu nhân vị trọng tâm (Person-Centered Psychotherapy). Dưới sự tự do học thuật ở miền Nam trước năm 1975, bà Tô Thị Ánh du học tại Đại học United States International, Mỹ và tốt nghiệp tiến sĩ vào năm 1972 với luận án tiến sĩ “Eastern and Western Cultural Values, Conflict or Harmony?” (To, 1972) do đích thân Giáo sư Carl Rogers hướng dẫn. Bà được xem là người đi tiên phong và đặt nền tảng vững chắc cho ngành Tâm lý Trị liệu tại Sài Gòn từ trước năm 1975, sau năm 1975 Sơ vẫn được tham gia giảng dạy tại Khoa Công tác Xã hội, đại học Mở TP. HCM. Sinh viên tâm lý học ở Việt Nam ít ai chưa từng đọc qua tác phẩm kinh điển “Tiến trình thành nhân” của Carl Rogers với tựa tiếng anh là “On becoming a person”. Người dịch tác phẩm đó sang tiếng Việt một cách sâu sắc vào năm 1992 là bà Tô Thị Ánh. Bà cũng là đồng dịch giả một tác phẩm khác có tựa “Sa mạc nở hoa” với tác phẩm gốc là “Dibs in Search of Self” của tác giả Virginia Axline, đây là một trong những tác phẩm kinh điển về tâm lý trị liệu trẻ em. ## **2. TS. SR. MARIA THECLA TRẦN THỊ GIỒNG (DÒNG ĐỨC BÀ: CONGRÉGATION NOTRE DAME - C.N.D)** > Bà Trần Thị Giồng là một nữ tu Công Giáo dòng Đức Bà và cũng là một tiến sĩ tham vấn và trị liệu tâm lý với hoạt động nghề nghiệp rất ""lặng lẽ"" ở Việt Nam, bà hoàn thành luận án tiến sĩ tại Đại học De La Salle từ năm 1993 và đã tham gia giảng dạy tại các trường đại học ở Việt Nam, cũng như một số các chương trình đào tạo thần học liên dòng cho các tu sĩ nam nữ trong hơn 20 năm (Joachim, 2015). Dưới sứ vụ tôn giáo, Sơ Giồng từng là Sơ giám tỉnh của dòng Đức Bà (C.N.D) tại Việt Nam. Sơ Giồng là một trong những nữ tu Công giáo đầu tiên được chính quyền ""cho phép"" đi du học trở lại vào cuối những năm 1980 sau khi Việt Nam vừa chấm dứt chiến tranh. Sơ Giồng là người hiếm hoi sau năm 1975 du học ngành tâm lý học nhưng không phải ở Liên Xô như những người khác được nhà nước chỉ định. Vì vậy sau giải phóng, bà là một trong những nhân vật đầu tiên quay trở lại tiếp cận tâm lý học hiện đại - như miền nam Việt Nam đã từng làm trước năm 1975. Năm 1991 bà tốt nghiệp thạc sĩ với luận văn ""Accompanied and unaccompanied adolescent Vietnamese refugees in Palawan: their problems, self concept and security level"" (Giong, 1991); cho tới năm 1993, bà tốt nghiệp tiến sĩ với luận án ""The effects of spiritual-psychological synthesis on anxiety, depression, and mental health of Vietnamese refugees."" (Giong, 1993); Thời điểm này ở Việt Nam,Tâm lý học Mác-xít đang chiếm một vị trí độc tôn (Sirikantraporn & Nguyen, 2020). ## **3. TS. SR. TERESA TRÌ THỊ MINH THÚY (DÒNG MẾN THÁNH GIÁ THỦ THIÊM - MTGTT)** > Tiến sĩ Trì Thị Minh Thúy hiện đang là giảng viên các chương trình cao học tại Khoa tâm lý học, Đại học Khoa học xã hội và Nhân văn, Đại học Quốc gia TP.HCM.

facebook,"I bet you didn’t know that the number one group of people pushing to support Israel’s apartheid genocide are Christian Evangelical Zionists. This religious group FAR FAR FAR outweigh Jewish Zionists in their massive influence of American foreign policy that it’s truly frightening. “Although difficult to assess, the current proportion of Christian Zionists among the 100-130 million of American Evangelicals (the population of United States is 293 million) could be estimated around 20-25%. “ You almost hear nothing about them or their nefarious plan because you are driven by the media to focus on a vastly exaggerated Muslim threat when the real threat is right in the heart of the USA. It has been there since the creation of Israel in 1948 and will be until they force their biblical prophecy on the world to come to pass and this is truly frightening. Why is it frightening? Because this singlular group of Christian Evangelical Zionist nutjubs who number in the millions believe that they MUST support a greater Israel they spans fromthe Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates in Iraq so that Christ will return to earth and bring about the Rapture. The rapture meaning the END TIMES. https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/forcing-end-times-us-christian-zionism-and-israel https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/14/half-of-evangelicals-support-israel-because-they-believe-it-is-important-for-fulfilling-end-times-prophecy/ https://thegroundtruthproject.org/the-faces-of-the-end-of-days/ For anyone not familiar with this insanity. Millions of Christian Zionists are literally begging for the end of the world so that their insane biblical prophecy can come to pass. “The tenet of Christian Zionism is that God’s promise of the Holy Land to the Jews is eternal. It’s not just something in antiquity,” Oldmixon said. “When we talk about the Holy Land, God’s promise of the Holy Land, we’re talking about real estate on both sides of the Jordan River. So the sense of a greater Israel and expansionism is really important to this community. Jerusalem is just central to that. It’s viewed as a historical and biblical capital.” They believe with their entire being that they will be risen into heaven on the day of the return of Christ and the destruction of Israel in a world conflict is the catalyst. ~belenus.",,404,"{'like_count': 199, 'comment_count': 78, 'num_users': 110631}",Call for a revolution in Ireland,,2023-10-20 11:43:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352059699_783252266666248_511642838226710453_n.jpg?stp=c9.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CGSJrWbaIKQAX-bJkDi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBJWRsaEGOz8ywOmUJWNUYnttYxewg6Rf5o-V3lr5s8lg&oe=6559DA85,https://www.facebook.com/100064719667755/posts/730283542472295,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/384543088_193870703746720_2351583595698141703_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=W5fiGzNHpHkAX9k5XCE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBvpAcRuZqHvtJ6nTTXpyvX1LFF1H1p-YrlBlEUPCqsfw&oe=65557E7E

facebook,"🚨Ib_Sports_RETURNS. The weekend is back with MAJOR LEAGUES 📌 #Ado_big_big #Asuk_akepe #Leggo 🚨⚪️⚫️ Eddie Howe on Sandro Tonali: “He's handling himself really well. He's trained twice this week with us and he's very much available for selection”. “We feel as a football club to throw our arms round him and protect him to give him the love and support he needs”. 🚨🐝 EXCL: Steve Torpey leaving role as senior Academy coach at Manchester City to join Brentford as new Academy Director. Brentford have reached an agreement with Torpey, all set to be signed soon. 🚨🔴 FC Bayern official statement on Noussair Mazraoui and pro-Palestine repost. FC Bayern München had a detailed and clarifying conversation with Noussair Mazraoui this week. The reason for the debate was Mazraoui's Instagram posts in connection with the terror against Israel almost two weeks ago, which led to irritation and criticism. “Noussair Mazraoui has credibly assured us that, as a peace-loving person, he resolutely rejects terror and war. He regrets if his posts have caused irritation,” says Jan-Christian Dreesen, CEO of FC Bayern, and explains: “FC Bayern condemns Hamas’ attack on Israel.” - “In addition,” explains Noussair Mazraoui, “I condemn every kind of terrorism and every terrorist organization.” FC Bayern and Noussair Mazraoui resolutely oppose the transfer of the Middle East conflict and its violence to Germany, which is committed to peace. Hatred and violence of any kind have no place in Germany's political culture. FC Bayern stands on the side of the Jewish community in Germany and on the side of Israel; nothing justifies the murder of children and families. FC Bayern is convinced that football should develop its power of balancing between different cultures, especially in the most difficult moments. Noussair Mazraoui will remain in the FC Bayern squad, but is currently out due to an injury he sustained during an international match with the Moroccan national team. 🚨🔵 Official, confirmed. Kaoru Mitoma has signed new long term deal today at Brighton. The agreement will be valid until June 2027 🇯🇵 🚨 Manchester United feel that January exit for Jadon Sancho is now very likely. There's still no clarity with the coaching staff and United will be open to let him leave in 2024 as tense situation remains. Only way to fix it has always been for Sancho to apologize. 🇵🇹 Understand Al Nassr have decided for Cristiano Ronaldo jr to start training with U-15 squad despite being 13 year old. He will start training with the team this week and he's gonna wear number 7. 🔴 Mount: ""Of course I know the pressure that comes with no. 7 shirt... but I like it!"". ""I want to perform in it and it is a massive, massive club and an iconic number so it really means a lot to me"". ""I have been a fan of the likes of Beckham growing up as a kid"". 🔴 Mason Mount: ""I'm very happy about how I am now integrating in the team, understanding the way the managers wants to play. I am learning the players around me, how they play"". ""I want to improve my performances but I think that will come over time"", told Talksport. 🔴⚪️ Arteta: “I'm a terrible loser. I was really disappointed not to win the title when we had a big chance to do it”. “I put the blame on me and I had to think if I'm still the right person to take the club to different level”, Arteta told @MenInBlazers. 🇳🇱 Denzel Dumfries: “I’m discussing my new contract at Inter. We are negotiating and I’d love to stay”. “I feel at home at Inter”, Dutch RB has added. Inter have offered Dumfries new deal until June 2028. 🚨 Bournemouth & USMNT midfielder Tyler Adams will be out until February. Previous surgery in March was not good enough — he needed new one and he’s gonna be out for 4 months at least, as reported by @PaulTenorio. 🇺🇸 Club & NT hope for Tyler back in February/March. 🚨🇳🇬 Napoli president De Laurentiis on Osimhen: “We verbally agreed on new deal in August, then if things change on his side… life goes on”. “Victor’s contract expires in June 2025, there’s always time”. “Remember… I sold Koulibaly to Chelsea one year before end of his deal”. 🔵🌟 Rangers are set to offer Ross McCausland new contract to keep him at the club beyond summer 2024. McCausland has featured in the last two games and made a positive impression. 🚨🟡🔵 Cristiano Ronaldo Jr signs with Al-Nassr U13 team — here we go! The agreement has been signed as Cristiano’s son will start training in the next days. He will wear number 7. Cristiano once said: “My son tells me: dad, hold on a few more years, I want to play with you!”. 🇬🇭 Mohammed Kudus’ agent Jennifer Mendelewitsch: “There was no counter-offer. Chelsea did this to lots of players this summer”. “They did with very low offers knowing they wouldn't be accepted. The truth is that they were completely taken by the transfer of Caicedo”, told RMC. 🇬🇭 Mohammed Kudus's agent, Jennifer Mendelewitsch: “We agreed contract with Chelsea but deal didn't happen”. “Ludus talked (truncated)",,373,"{'like_count': 231, 'comment_count': 115, 'num_users': 37653}",Sports Sailor,,2023-10-20 10:38:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/325130056_1004114187643745_9015060847697908118_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=p_hl6zpwci4AX94vDhv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCt0emv_Gs6jBow8yEl1c309r9Bd3hTnJAJqGETFxdqWQ&oe=655B9577,https://www.facebook.com/100064329632056/posts/723529629801352,

facebook,"NATIVE AMERICANS – THE FIRST OWNERS OF AMERICA Native Americans, or the indigenous peoples of the Americas, are the pre-Columbian inhabitants of North and South America and their descendants. Those who live within the boundaries of the present-day United States are composed of numerous, distinct tribes, bands and ethnic groups, many of which survive as intact, sovereign nations. Most authorities agree that the first evidence of people inhabiting North America indicates that they migrated here from Eurasia over 13,000 years ago, most likely crossing along the Bering Land Bridge, which was in existence during the Ice Age. However, some historians believe that people had migrated into the Americas much earlier, up to 40,000 years ago. These early Paleo-Indians spread throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes. Application of the term “Indian” originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. However, there is considerable evidence in support of successful explorations which led to Norse settlement of Greenland, the L’Anse aux Meadows settlement in Newfoundland, and potentially others some 500 years prior to Columbus landing in the Bahamas. From the Native American aspect, many tribes’ oral histories indicate they have been living here since their genesis, as described by a wide range of creation myths. By the time European adventurers arrived in the 15th century, scholars estimate that more than 50 million people were already living in the Americas. Of these, some 10 million lived in the region that would later become the United States. As time passed, these migrants and their descendants pushed south and east, adapting as they went. With these new arrivals came centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies. Today, Native Americans account for about 1.5 percent of the United States population, many of whom continue to take pride in their ancestral traditions — still practicing the music, art, and ceremonies that took place many years ago.",,334,"{'like_count': 199, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 36894}",Indigenous Civilization,,2023-10-20 16:56:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/280392205_173470005049950_5636698025732859169_n.jpg?stp=c15.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=1-F2jDse9gEAX9mbsTL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDpiN8ep8ZIxnmGWvMiTStPqGE2dhtgd4RRBvEvtmLYPQ&oe=655B2073,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1154661182018058/permalink/1511747002976139,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394278152_6677530705629412_7965246070687413956_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=UY8UF2c-hm4AX-drUgN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDkSfI_kfw569fJIWfDpbx8C2cWblPLPjmyi5Z8IBqpEQ&oe=653FC6A3
facebook,"Tarot Card of the Day - Four of Swords Perfect draw for the weekend. The Four of Swords is telling you to rest before you take on the next challenge. You’ve reached an important first milestone, but you must recharge your energy before the next phase begins so you are refreshed and ready to go. Even if you are highly productive and driven, take time out from your busy schedule to restore your energy and heal your body and mind. Constant stress and tension will break even the hardest and most resilient of people, but brief periods of rest enable you to refresh your energy, concentration, and focus so that you are ready for the next challenge.

facebook,"The Holy Spirit is realistic about our failings. He gently points out our mistakes and sins, and helps us to change. At times He may powerfully convict us, but He never condemns us. This realism about the continual struggle of Christians against sin is presented forcefully in the New Testament. In Hebrews 3:13 the writer says: ""Exhort one another daily ... lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."" Again in Hebrews 12:1 the writer speaks about ""the sin which so easily ensnares us."" And in verse 4 he says, ""You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin."" Dealing with sin is a life-and-death struggle. It is not shameful to acknowledge that sin is still at work in our lives. On the contrary, our great danger lies in refusing to acknowledge it, which leaves us unprepared to resist temptations when they do come. If the Holy Spirit were to wait until we are perfect to take up His dwelling within us, it would be like a professor saying to his students, ""I'll start teaching you when you have passed your exams."" His students would respond, ""But professor, that's not what we need! We need you to start teaching us now, so we'll learn what we need to pass our exams."" It is now that we need the Holy Spirit, so that we may have His help available to us continually to overcome the power of evil and to attain to God's standard of holiness. One particular area of conflict in which we need the Holy Spirit's help is in dealing with demons. The Holy Spirit does not withhold His help if He discerns that there are demons within us. On the contrary, He sees our need more clearly than we do ourselves, and He empowers us to expel them. Because He has compassion on us, He is willing to take up His dwelling within us, and to work with us to establish Christ's victory over all the power of the enemy. Our progress depends on the degree to which we cooperate with the Holy Spirit within us. Let me emphasize once again: The Holy Spirit does not come to indwell us because we are already perfect. He comes to help us so that we may become perfect. Certainly the Holy Spirit will not help us in our struggle with demons if we intend to continue living in sin. But if we recognize our sins and sincerely repent, He will fight with us against the demons that enslave us. With His help we will be able to expel them and be set free. - Derek Prince ( They Shall Expel Demons ) - @JESUS SAVES TV",,324,"{'like_count': 194, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 222303}",JESUS SAVES TV,,2023-10-20 18:29:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/276309766_925558518136443_500920755604224264_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=-ze0EqteG8sAX--c3xw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCBzbHn_F5WywEnDFskYJuOnP18AEv5rN0f2-RFNsh5QA&oe=655ADF8E,https://www.facebook.com/100063837275839/posts/764567389014497,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394060497_764567059014530_6163369630220101192_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=uAJZgh0d318AX_d1ZA4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfClJnaCleITJi6qGpPwia987EvPssM887hfzvOOIS4_Ug&oe=65386FF9

facebook,"The escalating tensions in the Gaza Strip is worrying, and incidents in the recent days has shaken us. It’s the footages of the children that break me, to have their innocence and lives lost in mere moments. No man, woman or child should undergo such a tragedy, no matter what faith you believe in. The Singapore Muslim community has been holding mass prayers for peace in Gaza. The prayers started yesterday and will continue across the various mosques in Singapore over the weekend. Thousands have turned up, young and old. Tonight, I prayed shoulder-to-shoulder with several hundreds more in Masjid Sultan. We prayed for peace, and for this conflict to resolve peacefully. Many have written to me, asking what they can do to help beyond just watching the events unfurl online. This humanitarian crisis has impacted Singaporeans, regardless of race or religion. I'm heartened to know that the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF), in collaboration with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), is organising a fundraising appeal to provide aid in the form of health, relief and shelter for communities affected by the recent developments in Gaza. 'Rahmatan Lil Alamin' means to be a blessing to all. In this same spirit, I call upon fellow Singaporeans of all faiths and races to help raise funds for all in Gaza. Tonight, and the nights that follow, hug your loved ones a little longer. Many families in Gaza have lost their loved ones forever. I stand in solidarity for Peace and Aid for all in Gaza. #PeaceAidforall #Gaza",,322,"{'like_count': 216, 'comment_count': 25, 'num_users': 33906}",Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,,2023-10-20 13:22:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/393268147_870306744465118_3431925254106188576_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=K6wb_3grz4wAX8n5R-A&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAraBo5DdoFjsgnI-9W9sgz-CP6lnGDLHKVUzt8cVHgug&oe=655B4DF1,https://www.facebook.com/100044574003296/posts/870298434465949,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/392868896_728412829302937_531957474991841760_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=KzacalpzKyMAX8czVdm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA7RweGSo54vjAKAMmsQR2MT15EKNkDMK7xkxmnUQpbww&oe=655AD3B3

facebook,"Quick message for earth signs 🌷 Themes: difficult period of time, conflict, need to defend yourself, suspicious, happy ending, conflict resolution, personal growth There is discomfort within a personal relationship or home environment that’s made you create a wall around yourself and you feel like you’ve turned cold or isolated from others. You’re dealing with a person or people who are selfish, abrasive and have really poor communication skills. I feel like it may be hard to escape their energy because they feel like they are in close proximity to you, you maY HAVE to see them often. Keeping your distance and doing your own thing while avoiding any immature interactions from them is the best option for now. I feel like they’re experiencing their own karma and personal chaos right now so it’s like they’re taking it out on everyone else. The good news is that I am seeing a positive change in this person/situation and over time I am seeing this energy dissipating and being replaced with peace and joy. CLEANSING and PROTECTION is recommended right now! Cleanse/ protect yourself and your space. It doesn’t have to be an elaborate ritual, a simple sea salt soak in the tub will do. Just make sure that you pour some salt water from your bath onto the crown of your head, when you’re done.. use the regular shower while imagining the bad energy washing off of you, and draining into the drain. Protection is as simple and imagining yourself in a protective little bubble or surrounded by gold light. Intention and visualization is everything!

facebook,"HALO Sri Lanka was delighted to welcome Anne-Marie Trevelyan MP, Minister of Indo-Pacific, Ben Mellor, Director for India and Indian Ocean Directorate, and Andrew Patrick, British High Commissioner for Sri Lanka, from British High Commission Colombo at our location in Muhamalai. We shared the impact of our mechanical clearance efforts in Muhamalai—the largest and densest minefield in Sri Lanka. HALO began work here in 2012 and has successfully found and destroyed over 250,000 explosive devices, including almost 75,000 anti-personnel mines. Our visitors met Nadarsa Sugirthan and his family, who were forced to flee their village in 1996 due to fighting. When HALO began clearing the minefield that encompassed Sugirthan’s land, a total of 1,305 explosives were discovered, including 810 anti-personnel mines. In 2020, the Nadarsa family was able to return to their ancestral land after 24 years of displacement. They can now live and work without fear and are building a more secure future together. Jenisha, Sugirthan's wife, works on the land to rear poultry, which serves as an additional source of income for the family by selling eggs and meat. Thank you to Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office for supporting our work to clear mines and explosives, ensuring the safety of local families and enabling people who were displaced by conflict to return home.",,307,"{'like_count': 276, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 67700}",The HALO Trust,,2023-10-20 08:00:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/278578494_366462215528319_8777162072781068693_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ICpFsfWis6IAX96fdNE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBA2n6lBaW5yfJJrJwA8djSmSCb5gGkYxEDFXkvT9qx8g&oe=655AC03A,https://www.facebook.com/100064936290741/posts/732001992307671,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394583560_732001865641017_7611158489492960769_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cd3uFUJQMiIAX_gLnRZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBrTjRKhVyhc6U811zj6UhMQgdswxMetuKZlIX8VZEcaQ&oe=655A3009

facebook,"U.S. President Joe Biden says he believes the first trucks carrying aid to Gaza would come through the Rafah crossing from Egypt within the next two days. Israel continued to pummel the Gaza Strip overnight with airstrikes, amid warnings that Israeli forces could invade the Hamas-ruled territory at any time. The Israel Defense Forces posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: “During the night, fighter jets attacked over a hundred operational targets of the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, destroying tunnel shafts, munitions warehouses and dozens of operational headquarters.” Meanwhile, Israel is planning to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona. Authorities said Friday that the town’s residents will be placed in state-funded guest houses. The northern city is located near Israel’s border with Lebanon and has been subjected to numerous rocket and missile attacks from Palestinian militant groups. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak travels Friday to Egypt, his latest Middle Eastern destination, as the conflict continues to grow.

facebook,"FAQ: Are My Loved Ones in Heaven Still Angry with Me? Your loved one in Heaven wants you to know that they love and care about you. So many times, our loved ones pass unexpectedly, or we don’t get to speak to them before they passed, leaving you with the question: Are they mad at me? The answer is no, not at all; they love you. Please know that if you have had an unresolved conflict or a disagreement with someone that had passed, they hold no grudges, just unconditional love. When our loved ones pass and go to the other side, they are all loving and non-judgmental. You see, emotions such as anger and disappointment are emotions that we experience here in the physical world but leave us as we make our transition to Heaven.

facebook,"I’m half Palestinian. One of my best friends is half Jewish (top left) We both have relatives in the conflict zone. I care about the safety of his family. He cares about the safety of mine. Both of us were born in the United States and grew up with little opportunity to connect with this part of our heritage. I was adopted and only just a few years ago found out my biological father and that whole side of my family is Palestinian. It led to me meeting some of my blood relatives for the very first time. I think this conflict is difficult for both of us in the sense of identity. On one hand, we were not raised in the cultures of our people...and yet in recent years, we have embarked on our own separate journeys to connect with the culture and history of our ancestors. He would take a bullet for me and I would take a bullet for him. But we wonder how things would be if we were raised differently. Would we be able to get along during this time? Maybe in a different world, we might even see each other on opposite sides of a battlefield? The point of this post is not about “taking sides”. I see many people putting a spotlight on the violence and bloodshed that has taken place and continues to take place. I think the point is maybe hope?... hope of co-existing? It’s so hard to see all this death. There are aunties, uncles and even siblings I’ve never met yet who I worry I might never get a chance to meet. I won’t pretend to be an expert on the Middle East. But what I do know is this...when you take away the titles. “Palestinian” “Jewish”....that’s what me and Sam are. That’s a truth. But our other truth is that we consider each other brothers...not by blood...but by the love and respect we have for each other as HUMAN BEINGS…and I just feel like that’s getting lost in all of this.",,266,"{'like_count': 87, 'comment_count': 34, 'num_users': 12794}",Eddie Dowd,,2023-10-20 11:00:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/331139726_662788915532930_3404784627514153748_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=JiO_WM2oCXcAX92Cvu-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDFpYxdsxg-pLCFMMorde6k-QT1dXnochlCIRC6dJOAVw&oe=655B0928,https://www.facebook.com/100058081209167/posts/725576906055010,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392936708_725576856055015_972833769985095334_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xqNZcIWvmmMAX_YZqiu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD1YmbcYW5reTl5BdJcBvrYzBnzLcFXT1pmJGSKt_1evg&oe=6559A25F

facebook,"Graduation ceremony at Nehale lyaMpingana Barracks celebrates military excellence Staff Reporter THE Army Battle School at Nehale lyaMpingana Barracks was a scene of celebration and achievement on the 13th of October as it hosted a joint graduation ceremony for four significant military courses. These courses, the 11th Company Group Commanders Course, the 14th Platoon Commanders Course, the Platoon Sergeant Course, and the Section Commander's Course, aimed to equip students with essential knowledge in both Conventional Warfare and Low-Intensity Conflict Operations. The ceremony was officiated by Brigadier General Andreas Diyeve, the Deputy Army Commander, and he extended his heartfelt congratulations to the graduates for their outstanding performances throughout the demanding training. General Diyeve emphasized the vital role these programs play in developing a highly trained military force. In his address, the Deputy Army Commander stressed the cornerstone of success for all armed forces: training. He encouraged graduates at all levels and soldiers alike to cultivate a culture of continuous learning. He underlined the significance of prioritizing training to ensure that the defence force remains fully prepared to fulfil its national mandate in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Namibia. General Diyeve noted, ""It is, therefore, of paramount importance that all commanders and uniformed personnel prioritize training."" Expressing his gratitude, the General acknowledged the Course Officers, Instructors, and all supporting staff for their unwavering dedication and commitment to imparting valuable knowledge and innovations to the members. Their contributions played a pivotal role in the success of the graduates. Notably, the students who completed these courses came from all branches of the Namibian Defence Force (NDF): The Army, Air Force, and Namibian Navy.

facebook,"Războiul Israel-Palestina se complică și din pricina conflictului de opinie între Biden și Obama. Explicația detonării spitalului din Gaza! În această analiză îmi propun să vă explic abordarea majoritar pro-palestiniană din mass-media și societatea civilă din SUA, ce vine în mod surprinzător în contradicție cu poziționarea pro-Israel a Casei Albe, așa cum a fost exprimată prin penibila vizită a lui Biden la Tel Aviv. Din start vă reamintesc ipoteza demonstrată public că Barack Obama, fostul șef al lui Biden, controlează mare parte din puterea discretă americană, și așa vă puteți explica, spre exemplu, poziționările anti-Israel și Netanyahu ale universitarilor de la Harvard sau ale jurnaliștilor CNN, fiind de notorietate în SUA relația de adversitate pe care fostul președinte american o are cu Bibi Netanyahu. Vă relatez un episod elocvent la care am asistat în urmă cu vreo 11 ani, chiar la Washington. Organizasem o vizită pentru un grup de parlamentari români ce doreau să-și consolideze relații cu mediul de putere din SUA, iar printre evenimentele programate a fost și participarea la Congresul AIPAC (Comitetul de Afaceri Publice Americano-Israeliene), unde erau prezenți vreo 10000 de evrei americani. Era mare încordare în sală, pe care ghidul nostru, un influent evreu iubitor de România, mi-a explicat-o ca fiind cauzată de posibila ciocnire dintre Bibi Netanyahu, premier și atunci al Israelului, prezent la eveniment, și președintele SUA Barack Obama, ce fusese invitat să țină un discurs, dar nu era sigur că va veni, tocmai din pricina adversităților cu mult aplaudatul Bibi. Ei bine, Obama a venit, iar în momentul în care a pășit către prezidiu, ghidul nostru, într-un moment de emoție exagerată, ne-a zis să ne întoarcem cu spatele la tribună ca să-l sfidăm pe Obama, așa cum făcuseră deja mulți evrei din jurul nostru. Am blocat rapid inițiativa copilărească a ghidului nostru, și-am asistat astfel la întâlnirea glacială Obama-Bibi, apoi la discursul bun, dar slab aplaudat al președintelui SUA, la cel primit cu mare entuziasm al lui Netanyahu, apoi a venit pauza și am plecat. Luându-l deoparte ulterior pe evreul nostru ca să-i cer socoteală pentru prostia pe care o făcuse și să-l întreb care a fost cauza, după ce și-a cerut scuze mi-a explicat că Obama nu e unul de-al lor și că nu-l iubește pe Bibi, și nici Israelul, deoarece are origini musulmane, iar politica lui este una de adversitate cu evreii din Orientul Mijlociu, cauzată de modul în care aceștia tratează cauza palestiniană, deci merita cumva un asemenea tratament de sfidare. Dezvoltând subiectul mi-a arătat cum pe Obama îl cheamă și Hussein, nume dat de tatăl său de origine kenyană și religie musulmană, iar după moartea acestuia Barack a fost crescut de tatăl adoptiv, care era un indonezian tot de religie musulmană, deci așa se explică adversitatea lui Obama pentru Netanyahu și interesele Israelului în Orientul Mijlociu, respectiv dedicarea pentru cauza palestiniană. Am priceput astfel că prin această prismă îl privesc evreii pe Barack Hussein Obama! Judecând în acest fel exodul musulmanilor către țările UE (nu mai dezvolt aici și treaba relaționării deficitare SUA-Israel din perioada 2008-2016), inițiat în mandatele lui Obama, inspirat de strategiile lui Soros, prietenul lui Obama, exod înlesnit și motorizat de către fostul cancelar Angela Merkel, cel mai apropiat lider politic de fostul președinte american (așa cum a reieșit și din mărturisirile publice ale celor doi), vă puteți explica mai bine trecutul recent referitor la subiect. Revenind la vizita lui Biden în Israel, ce-a apărut ciudată, forțată, cu rezultate contestate puternic în mass-media și societatea civilă americane, vă reamintesc că aceasta a fost programată ca având și o componentă de întâlniri cu reprezentanții palestinienilor, ce-a fost anulată tocmai prin distrugerea spitalului din Gaza, sutele de morți, respectiv protestele violente ale palestinienilor. De-aici pricepem bine premeditarea, știți părerea mea că spitalul a fost bombardat din ordinul expres al lui Netanyahu, care în acest fel a reușit eliminarea din negocierile momentului a reprezentanților cauzei palestiniene. Cumva putem înțelege că partea din demersul american de dezamorsare a conflictului prin discuții și cu palestinienii, inspirată fiind de zona de putere din SUA controlată de Obama, fiind anulată în acest mod, va da naștere unui mare război politic intern în America, iar acesta s-a putut ghici din criticile dure ale majorității jurnaliștilor la adresa lui Biden și a Casei Albe, aceștia fiind tot cei ce sprijineau fără rezerve până mai ieri politicile SUA, inclusiv cele dezastruoase referitoare la războiul ucrainean. Ar mai fi multe de spus și speculat, e limpede că vorbim despre un mare conflict iscat la vârful puterii americane din pricina poziționării diferite legate de evreii și palestinienii din Orientul Mijlociu, o să dezvolt explicațiile în zilele următoare. Deocamdată e clar că Israelul și (truncated)",,252,"{'like_count': 209, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 106602}",Cozmin Gusa,,2023-10-20 07:16:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292566116_384763190310470_4569491754297603026_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IZksMKZV3cYAX_rpT-N&_nc_oc=AQm2DAiAJsvye8-SdPHesFAbZOXSRCQo7mATETTaqyIdCRxbGGYW1TrCF19o371Efe8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMtf72eW8X_9jFJt6lNXI5-ZrOH44XQ4MoBvz0dIA1-g&oe=655B243A,https://www.facebook.com/100063303756078/posts/649910883795698,

facebook,"Native Americans – The First Owners of America Native Americans, or the indigenous peoples of the Americas, are the pre-Columbian inhabitants of North and South America and their descendants. Those who live within the boundaries of the present-day United States are composed of numerous, distinct tribes, bands and ethnic groups, many of which survive as intact, sovereign nations. Most authorities agree that the first evidence of people inhabiting North America indicates that they migrated here from Eurasia over 13,000 years ago, most likely crossing along the Bering Land Bridge, which was in existence during the Ice Age. However, some historians believe that people had migrated into the Americas much earlier, up to 40,000 years ago. These early Paleo-Indians spread throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes. Application of the term “Indian” originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. However, there is considerable evidence in support of successful explorations which led to Norse settlement of Greenland, the L’Anse aux Meadows settlement in Newfoundland, and potentially others some 500 years prior to Columbus landing in the Bahamas. From the Native American aspect, many tribes’ oral histories indicate they have been living here since their genesis, as described by a wide range of creation myths. By the time European adventurers arrived in the 15th century, scholars estimate that more than 50 million people were already living in the Americas. Of these, some 10 million lived in the region that would later become the United States. As time passed, these migrants and their descendants pushed south and east, adapting as they went. With these new arrivals came centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies. Today, Native Americans account for about 1.5 percent of the United States population, many of whom continue to take pride in their ancestral traditions — still practicing the music, art, and ceremonies that took place many years ago.",,250,"{'like_count': 117, 'comment_count': 62, 'num_users': 18367}",🏹🍁🍂 Market Native American 🍁🍂🏹,,2023-10-20 16:39:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/341762039_1108448603880757_7936210045334173025_n.jpg?stp=c0.4.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=SCJ_MyhLVbMAX_yaPEk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAIRqtgMtXrvcHw8S4gAIg2PtzTIzE7DSL5qK43_PXb7Q&oe=655A2C0D,https://www.facebook.com/groups/614975313840418/permalink/707991007872181,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392952200_1106857610588419_3332555024732329822_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Im8Un3btuKkAX-GvdpL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBwnTYhx7LIP2fw2VMKIro2Z28s9tuXoezcd4t0dST_Qg&oe=65414C83

From Day one of that charade you called a cookathon, we could see the greed and pecuniary interest pushing you two; you all never had us fooled for one minute. Now that you need the help of same Nigerians you collaborated with your pastor to make mockery of a great feat one of us had achieved less than a month before your silliness was unveiled, please remember that (s)he that comes to equity must come with clean hands.

facebook,"A six-year-old was MURDERED by his neighbor… because he was Palestinian. The little boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, was killed by his 71-year-old landlord in Illinois. The landlord had been consuming right-wing media such as conservative talk radio and was ""heavily interested"" in the conflict in Israel. His wife described him getting increasingly paranoid, saying that he had withdrawn $1,000 from a bank “in case the U.S. grid went down,” and was anxious he would be attacked by Arab people. He channelled that Islamophobia into a heinous attack on his tenants, and now he has been charged with first-degree murder and two hate crimes. This man stabbed a little boy 26 TIMES. The boy’s mother is in serious condition. “This despicable hate crime is a shameful reminder of the destructive role Islamophobia plays in our society,” said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. Unfortunately, this is just a warning sign of what’s to come with increasing rhetoric that dehumanizes Palestinians. *************************** Independent creators rely on your support to create the content you want!

facebook,"It was a long journey last night and I’ve never come closer to missing a connecting flight but miraculously Laura and I and even our gear has reached Tbilisi! Playing tonight with new material and a whole new format geared towards the club 🖤 Images by @laxdoela from our performance in Munich. Also just want to add that these last few days have led to the sharpest uptick of really nasty messages in my DMs that I’ve ever seen. Standing up for human rights means standing up for humans EVERYWHERE to live in peace. My passion on this subject is derived from having visited Auschwitz at 15 and truly internalised the message ‘never again’. It is starkly clear to me that violence against civilians is never the conflict resolution technique that those in power think it is. Trauma remains in our bodies and hearts for generations, and the trauma in the eyes of every child in Gaza and Israel shatters my heart because I know it will remain with them forever. This is not an issue that should be considered controversial. Please take a moment to imagine that those of us taking a stand are doing so because we care about HUMANS and wish to stand on a side of history that allows us to sleep at night. That said, the messages of support have been even more plentiful. And tend to be from those with far more at stake in the conflict, Palestinians and Israelis alike. Many have expressed that they don’t feel like they can be outspoken for fear of consequences and that’s really alarming. So please, if you have a platform and a voice, and the only thing you’re afraid of is losing a few followers, don’t remain quiet.

facebook,"Prayer Chain Tonight: 8:00 PM EST 10-20-23 JG: Marching Orders : received, 3-6-23 Scripture Prayer: by Kim Ellison Marching Orders - EVERY NATION PLOTTING AGAINST MY NAYIONS WILL IMPLODE MARCHING ORDERS: God says: * to be encouraged; * open your heart to Me; and * get ready to receive all I have planned for you. I DECLARE IN JESUS’ NAME: * the enemy will mot control me or this world anymore; * my enemies are defeated, and their control and power has come to an end; * my hope is in the Lord (God will not let me down nor disappoint me); and * God is my deliverer. Proverbs 23:26 My son, give me your heart and let your eyes observe and delight in my ways, Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the thoughts and plans that I have for you, says the Lord, thoughts and plans for welfare and peace and not for evil, to give you hope in your final outcome. Colossians 2:15 (God) disarmed the principalities and powers that were ranged against us and made a bold display and public example of them, in triumphing over them in Him and in it ( the cross). Deuteronomy 28:7 The Lord shall cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before your face; they shall come out against you one way and flee you seven ways. Deuteronomy 31:6-8 6 Be strong, courageous, and firm; fear not nor be in terror before them, for it is the Lord your God Who goes with you; He will not fail you or forsake you. 7 And Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong, courageous, and firm, for you shall go with this people into the land which the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to possess it. 8 It is the Lord Who goes before you; He will (march) with you; He will not fail you or let you go or forsake you; (let there be no cowardice or flinching, but) fear not, neither become broken (in spirit—depressed, dismayed, and unnerved with alarm). Psalm 18:2-3 2 The Lord is my Rock, my Fortress, and my Deliverer; my God, my keen and firm Strength in Whom I will trust and take refuge, my Shield, and the Horn of my salvation, my High Tower. 3 I will call upon the Lord, Who is to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies. A Prayer for Healing and Divine Protection Based on Psalm 91 Heavenly Father, in Jesus’ Name, I thank you and praise you that you are my refuge and shelter from the storm. I thank you that you are always with me and will never leave nor forsake me. I thank you that you remain faithful. Help me to abide and stay close to you. You are my refuge, my fortress, and my protection from all the dangers of life. I lay down all anxiety, fear, and concern. I put my trust in you, O God Most High. Help me to live and rest in you in this hour and always. Deliver us O God and rescue us from the hand of the enemy. Let us not be afraid or overcome by sickness, disease, and deadly viruses, for you come to give us life and life more abundantly. It is you that heals all our sickness and disease. By your stripes, we have been healed. I stand on your promises O God, and I shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night or the pestilence and deadly diseases and viruses that stalk the world and our nation. I shall not be afraid of the disaster that strikes for I put my trust in you. Almighty God, the Creator of the entire universe. I stand on your promise that even if a 1,000 may fall at my side or 10,000 at my right hand, it shall not come near me. These evils shall not touch me. I put my hope and trust in you. You are my Lord, my Savior, and my God. You are my refuge and shelter from the storms of life. So, I declare now that no evil shall conquer me. No Plague shall come near my dwelling. I ask for your mighty angels to protect and watch over me, my family, my friends, my neighbors, my loved ones, my county, my state, the trafficked children, our rightful president, the whistleblowers, Israel, Hawaii, all nations in conflict, our veterans, those who are in leadership positions that stand for you, truth, honesty, and justice. I pray that you watch over our nation, O God. I pray for the hearts of the people to be turned back to you. Give us a heart of repentance O God. Help us make a new commitment to follow you with all our hearts. I pray that sickness, disease, and ungodly viruses be crushed under our feet in the mighty name of Jesus. Rescue us, O God, for we love you. Protect us, for we trust you. We call upon you in this hour. Hear our prayer, O God. Be with us in these troubled times. Let us show the love of God and be a blessing to those around us. I pray in the mighty and matchless Name of Jesus Christ. May we be covered in your precious blood.

facebook,"HMCS’ AFTERCARE PROGRAMME VISITS EX-OFFENDERS IN MAPHUNGWANE AND BOYANE Yesterday, the Correctional Services’ Rehabilitation, Reintegration and Aftercare programme visited three ex-inmates who were successfully reintegrated into their communities after being released from incarceration. They have since ventured into farming, through the skills they acquired whilst serving time at our centres. They have been praised by their communities as reformed individuals who make positive contributions towards the development of their communities and the economy. The ex-offenders expressed appreciation to the Commissioner General for allowing them to be part of the vocational programme that imparts skills to offenders in farming, building, welding, carpentry, plumbing and painting amongst other trades. HMCS’ vocational programmes are aimed at bridging the skills gap in order to enhance ex-offenders’ prospects of employability as well as making them self-sustainable post-incarceration. The ex-offenders also thanked their families and various people who have helped them to start their business. The Commissioner General LaMakhosini Phindile Dlamini said the introduction of vocational education and training as part of offender rehabilitation offers those in conflict with the law opportunities to learn new skills that would help sustain them after serving their sentences. She said this would also increase the likelihood of successful reintegration into their communities and help reduce the risk of recidivism.",,227,"{'like_count': 174, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 7678}",His Majesty's Correctional Services,,2023-10-20 11:43:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/277174433_336794838496423_2615296307540901552_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=AEo6FZb-BF4AX9dWZmW&_nc_oc=AQl0cm7tj-F9rcB__Gce8zn3wlXWVYPew-KOPV7r-nodBCDzj4NcRl5lBd0_ghZI7Z8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDyB67hTitGbDKN3hPjs2ANg52jSC04mJIYmAa5Y-w2KQ&oe=655A1FF8,https://www.facebook.com/100064977270263/posts/704323965076840,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394382111_704322758410294_2126833174855002968_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8_cfNMcH4J0AX9Yb_4v&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmx1KWsViQaKeTqfzPz1Ql7OWYDcq2tQTKYC9MaqWRGw&oe=6537C619

facebook,"[Israel/Gaza] Several eminent Jewish jurists have written a moving piece on the Hamas attack on Israel, and the Israeli response which is ongoing. It is a clear moral statement. ----- Financial Times (www.ft.com:=:https://www.ft.com/) The laws of war must guide Israel’s response to Hamas atrocity We write as Jews, many of us with family and friends directly affected by the tragedy that has befallen Israel. Like so many others, the vile crimes perpetrated by Hamas in Israel have shaken us to our core. We also write in our capacity as lawyers. We do so because, instilled with our Jewish values, we believe that law, and the adherence to the rule of law, provide an invaluable guide to begin to make sense of what we are witnessing and to provide a path to govern responses to it. In these darkest of days, we write to emphasise the importance of international law as a guide to all. Three points bear emphasis. First, the despicable actions of Hamas are not simply a moral outrage but an egregious violation of all norms of international law. The murder of hundreds of civilians in cold blood, and the range of other atrocities committed are, without doubt, crimes against humanity. They are also war crimes, indeed they amount to the most grave form of breaches of the Geneva Conventions. So too, the taking of hostages — it will surprise no one that grabbing terrified young children, holding them in captivity and using them as pawns in a gruesome form of negotiation is a gross violation of all applicable legal standards. To be clear, there are no possible defences to these crimes — whatever the context, there is no room for legal, let alone moral, equivocation when it comes to (for example) the slaughter of hundreds of young people enjoying a party. Second, Israel has a clear right in international law to respond in self-defence, indeed like all states it has a duty to defend its citizens. Its international borders have been breached by a paramilitary force and its civilians brutally murdered and subjected to severe atrocities. It also has a clear right to seek justice for the crimes that have been committed on its soil, not simply against those captured by Israeli forces but against the Hamas organisation itself and those who enable its military operations. Third, just as international law provides the means for categorising and criminalising the barbaric acts of Hamas, so too does it provide a framework for governing how Israel must respond. Any nation, conducting any armed conflict, no matter what the provocation, is bound in law to comply with all the “laws of war”. The laws of war are not pacifist. Rather, they are the opposite — they are an admission that there are occasions when war is necessary. They are designed to ensure that when war must be conducted, there are limits on what harm can be done to other human beings. As the leading Israeli lawyer Michael Sfard describes it, they represent humanity’s renunciation of the pacifist idea of a complete prohibition on the use of force in exchange for rules protecting basic humanity. These laws apply irrespective of the level of outrageous conduct of an enemy and no exceptions to those rules can be derived from the level of suffering caused by Hamas’s actions. There are some aspects of Israel’s response that already cause significant concern. International law forbids sieges of civilian populations. Gaza is home to some 2mn fellow human beings (almost half of whom are children) and it would be a grave violation of international law to hold them under siege and while doing so deprive them of basic necessities such as food and water. To be clear, collective punishment is prohibited by the laws of war. Equally, international law requires combatants to ensure minimum destruction to civilian life and infrastructure. An intent to cause indiscriminate damage, rather than behaving in a precise manner to minimise damage would, if established, constitute a grave violation of international law. In the conduct of any military campaign, politicians and commanders alike must be careful to ensure that their words do not imply to their troops that the laws of war can be disregarded, nor employ language whose effect is to dehumanise a civilian population. In these early days when emotions are so understandably raw, many might be reluctant to remind Israel of its international law obligations, considering to do so insensitive or inappropriate. However, we disagree. In these times of pain and terror the notion that there are laws that we must all live by is challenging but essential. Jewish history teaches us that we cannot give up on them.

facebook,"In remarks at a press conference with his German counterpart, Ayman Safadi said the war would have ""catastrophic repercussions"" and urged ""protecting the region from the danger of its expansion"". ""All the indications are that the worst is coming.. The catastrophe will have painful consequences in coming periods,"" Safadi said, adding that diplomatic efforts were not yielding any results in ending the conflict. Fears of a widening war also cast a shadow on a meeting between Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Thursday in Cairo. In a statement after the meeting, the two leaders said they rejected forcibly displacing Palestinians and that Israel was ""imposing collective punishment"" on the inhabitants of Gaza by bombing civilians after the Hamas attack. The conflict has stirred long-standing fears in Jordan, home to a large population of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, that a wider conflagration would give Israel the chance to implement a transfer policy to expel Palestinians en masse from the West Bank. Jordan, which shares a border with the West Bank, absorbed the bulk of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of their homes when Israel was created. | via Reuters",,213,"{'like_count': 71, 'comment_count': 27, 'num_users': 8782726}",Philippine Star,,2023-10-20 07:32:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/341858556_918415572727450_374717831366242673_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CecJtIgqe6QAX9kyAEL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDQlbN_xjai8pwVgUMXBU-S86hAA8foALC9kDrR1e8QGA&oe=655AF380,https://www.facebook.com/100064616655120/posts/723690536461495,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393724508_723690493128166_2453637902460641470_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=VvRNyxqmSGAAX-_e8mS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBUxCY8YJX9l1Wj3v73zF1BkTcmkEbwsEdWP6LlRPO14A&oe=6537DB3C

Ako po ay 18 yrs old na, first yr college sa kursong marketing management. Maayos ang aking pag aaral kahit nagbboyfriend ako, 1yr and 7 months na kmi, sya yung tipo ng lalake na kung magmahal ay todo kumbaga 'B4LIW' sakin lg daw sya naging ganon, and ako lang din kasi ang tumagal sa kanya kaya siguro ganon na lang sya magmahal sakin. Same kaming nag aaral pero sa hirap ng buhay ng pamilya nya nakatigil sya, kaya high school pa lang sya ngayon dahil ilang taon syang tumigil sa pag aaral para lang mas piliin magtrabaho para may makain ang pamilya nya, sya yung tipo ng tao na mas uunahin ang iba bago ang sarili. So yung conflict dito sa loob at tagal ng relasyon namin dumadating kami sa point na pag maghihiwalay, at sasabihin nya sa akin na mag ssuicid3 sya, kaya imbes na makikipag hiwalay ako hindi na lang. Paulit ulit ang sinario nmin na ganon, kaya habang tumatagal nafefell out of love ako sa mga ganon nyang pananalita sakin, lalo na pag may kasalanan sya or may matindi kaming pag aaway gusto nya mapagbibigyan yung gusto nya, kaya di ko alam kung tama paba to. Enopen ko nman sa knya na ayoko ng ganon, kaya sana pakinggan at erespeto nya rin yung desisyon ko. pede po ba hihingi ng advice ano ba ang dapat kong gawin para ma solve ko ang suliranin ko/namin sa relasyon namin, sobrang hirap na rin po kase ako parang pinipilit ko na lang na mag stay sa kanya, pero wala nakong nararamdaman haha, nakakagawa na po kasi sya ng mga bagay na nakakaturn off sakin tulad ng paninigarilyo na pinaka ayoko sa lahat which is alam nya yon. Pahingi naman ng advice ano dapat kung gawin ipagpapatuloy ko pa ba o ititigil ko na? 'at lalayo na lang ako salamat po.

Israel has bombarded the enclave in retaliation, worsening conditions for the 2.3 million people living there under a blockade by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007.

facebook,"My October Newsletter has been released this week: Dear Friends, Cultural Creatives and Seekers Everywhere, War does not determine who is right, it determines who is left ~ On September 11, 2001, before the smoke from the collapsed Twin Towers had even cleared, the world’s leaders came knocking on the White House door. They were seeking George Bush’s support to create a global coalition that once and for all would strive to eliminate planetary terrorism. Unfortunately, Bush declined the invitation so that he could attack Iraq and end a family feud by eliminating Saddam Hussein, who was not even involved in the attack on the twin towers. The world is currently trying to come to terms with the inhumane atrocities carried out by both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Around the globe, citizens are rallying in a concerted effort to bring an end to the barbaric nature of planetary violence and war in today’s modern world. On the horizon, I see a second opportunity is now arising wherein global civilization is once again coalescing and demanding an end to war. War, violence, and division only perpetuate a cycle of suffering. We must now begin to emphasize that it is not our differences, but our common humanity that must come to the forefront. Through nurturing compassion and empathy, we will come to recognize the notion that the well-being of one is intrinsically linked to the well-being of all. This is the first step towards healing the world. In times of crisis, we come together to support one another, regardless of our backgrounds. This ability to unite must extend beyond moments of crisis to become a way of life. It is my fervent hope that we can create a world where differences are celebrated, where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and understanding, and where the power of our shared humanity prevails. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a painful reminder of the work that lies ahead, but it is not an insurmountable challenge. Let us commit to educating ourselves about the complexities of this issue, to supporting peace initiatives, and to spreading the message of unity. By doing so, we can honor our shared humanity and work toward a future where conflicts no longer define our world.

facebook,"Beste N-VA,

Bart De Wever, jullie voorzitter, heeft het recht om Israël ""de kant van het licht"" te noemen. Fysiek misselijk word ik van die uitspraken, maar hij heeft het recht om ze te doen. 

Ook hebben jullie het recht om tot vervelens toe in de media te komen klagen over 'woke' en 'cancel culture', ookal zijn er weinig mensen wiens meningen zo dominant aanwezig zijn in het maatschappelijke debat als die van jullie. 

Het probleem, beste N-VA, is dat jullie graag ook het recht zouden willen hebben om jullie mening te uiten zonder tegengesproken te worden. Wel, dat recht heb je in een goed functionerende democratie nu eenmaal nooit. 

In een goed functionerende democratie heb je te maken met kritische middenveldsorganisaties. En goede democraten gaan die niet intimideren omdat ze een andere mening aan bod laten komen dan de hunne. 

Dus ja, die screening voelt best wel intimiderend aan. Maar neen, wij gaan absoluut niet stoppen met wijzen op de oorlogsmisdaden van Israël. 

Natuurlijk kiezen wij kant in dit conflict. Dat is, zoals steeds, de kant van de mensenrechten en het internationaal recht. Iemand moet het doen, beste N-VA, want op jullie kunnen we daarvoor jammer genoeg niet rekenen.

Groeten,

facebook,"Today Daisy was spayed. It was necessary, but a scary experience for her, as she wss fearful and snappy. But it is done now, very tired. Hopefully feeling better soon. Thank you all for your kind and supportive words and for the knowledge that so many of you have. Most rescues in my area do not take dogs like this, or don’t give them time in rescue before adoption. Medical dogs attract donations, and these dogs do not, so I think it’s financial and about the time needed for these dogs. The time involved makes it hard to rescue many fearful dogs. It is nearly impossible to find any fosters who would do this for a fearful dog, so I encourage any of you that are able to offer your patience and knowledge, to foster a fearful dog, even if it’s once every other year. It also takes extra effort to place a fearful dog, and I have to disappoint more people to do it well. My only rehab fosters eventually adopted two fearful dogs from me, over several years. So their home is full up. And they took dogs that would have been hard or impossible to place. Now she is cuddling and giving kisses: a very fast turnaround, after sleeping for the better part of three days, and still sleeping a lot. It does appear that her home may have involved domestic conflict. Though she loves Dave and happily sits on his lap, if he approaches me in a way that seems like he’s leaning over me or reaches towards me, she growls. It does not fit with my experience of resource guarding. Any tips? My book should be here any day! Update: she’s decided to join us in the same room! I have a new dog in my home non-profit rescue that is very fearful, cannot be touched or will try to nip. She is a 4.5 pound Pomeranian mix, unspayed. She was rehomed twice in the past two and a half weeks. I do have experience rehabilitating fearful/abused dogs but I know there’s much more to learn. I am not touching or looking directly at her. The last home was an apt. with children who tried to touch her and pick her up. She was very nippy by the time they surrendered her to me. The previous home allegedly had her since 8 weeks old. They said that they were rehoming because her owner went away to college. However I’ve since learned that this dog was very fearful and nippy at the vets, with the first owners. Both rehomings took place via Craigslist. I have had her just 48 plus hours. She has a drag line on and I can take her out to potty, but she otherwise chooses to stay in the crate and looks very fearful. She will actively try to nip if any effort is made to exchange her drag line for a longer one. I've just purchased the Do No Harm Book! Hasn't yet arrived.

facebook,"IN RESPONSE to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, a total of 77 Zambians, including 72 students and five other individuals, have been successfully evacuated and returned to Zambia. https://www.facebook.com/100064560977290/posts/728973465931346/ Currently, there are 172 Zambians living in Israel, with 143 being students and the remainder consisting of diplomats and other residents. The conflict in the Gaza Strip has resulted in the loss of approximately 3,000 lives. Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Stanley Kakubo has Parliament that no Zambian has been killed in the conflict. Mr Kakubo said the Ministry is still in talks with the embassy there to ensure the welfare and safety of those who have chosen to stay back in the conflict zone. The Minister was responding to a question raised by Pambashe Member of Parliament, Ronald Chitotela regarding the conflict in the Gaza Strip. ""I would like to highlight that Government has facilitated the voluntary, temporary relocation of all Zambians who have expressed a desire to return to our homeland for the time being. So far number totalling to 77 Zambians arrived safely in Lusaka as of October 18th, 2023, these include 72 students and five others. For those who have chosen to remain in Israel, be rest assured that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation will maintain close collaboration with the Embassy and the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and stands ready to take any necessary actions that will ensure their continued welfare and safety,"" he said. Mr Kakubo said President Hakainde Hichilema has reiterated the importance of Peace, Security and Stability and it is in this vein that Zambia reaffirms its commitment to ensuring peace, stability and security. “The loss of lives in both Israel and the Gaza Strip is regrettable and we wish to extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to all the affected individuals and families. Madam Speaker, the international response to these unsettling developments has been resolute. The Chair of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) issued a strong condemnation of the violence, urging all parties to exercise restraint to prevent further escalation, understanding that such an outcome would undermine the extensive global efforts for peace and security in the Middle East,” he said.

facebook,"An estimated 5,000 worshippers gathered at Parry Park Lakemba earlier this afternoon to offer their Jumu'ah prayer for the people of Palestine. The event was put together by the LMA in collaboration with a number of other masjids and religious organisations in light of the recent conflict in Gaza. The LMA took the almost unprecedented step of moving Jumu’ah from our iconic Lakemba Mosque to nearby Parry Park to cater for the anticipated huge crowd and our expectations were well and truly met. Lakemba Mosque Imam Sheikh Yahya Safi (Arabic) and Sheikh Wesam Charkawi (English) delivered the khutbahs and spoke passionately about the oppression being suffered by our Palestinian brothers and sisters at the hands of the tyrants. Their words were eloquently supported by our other speakers Abraham Zoabi, Sheikh Ahmed Abdo and Siddiq Buckley. A sincere thank you to our community for their attendance today and for their exceptional generosity as a substantial amount was raised by our charity arm Feed The World.

I didn't take much of anything; most of my clothes were bought with Chima's money–those ones, I didn't take. The jewellery and shoes too were left behind. I figured that if I was leaving, I should at least leave with some chunk of my dignity intact. When I pulled my little box out to the living room, Chima was surprised. ""You didn't take everything?"" He asked. I scoffed. ""Are you desperately trying to get rid of me and every bit of memory of me?"" I shot back. He sat back, uneasy, then scratched his greying beards. ""That's not what I meant, Celine. You have ten times more stuff than what you're taking so I'm just surprised you didn't take more."" I dipped my head. Maybe it was too late to try and be nice or something, but I still went with my instincts. ""Chima, thank you, but those things are yours. Keep them or better yet, burn them once I'm gone!"" He was silent for a long while, and that treatment made me feel foolish. Here I was hoping he'd change his mind. But to hell with that. I wasn't going to force him to keep me around. My lies were catching up with me, and I had to bear the consequences. But the past seven years hurt! I gave everything to this union. He was older than I was by maybe two times, but I still stayed with him. Yeah, at first it was for the money, but later his dedication and care had won me over completely. ""I'll go now!"" I said. ""Wait!"" He said, and I turned to face him. ""Where does your mother live?"" I took a deep breath. I'd informed him that I'd go visit her, but I had no idea why he was asking. Regardless, I told him the village and the house location. ""You want to visit?"" I asked. ""Maybe. I don't know."" Chima's cold treatment said it all. I left. After leaving, I didn't go to the village immediately. No, I stopped by to see my hired mother. When the woman saw me alight from the keke, she smiled and came out to greet me. ""Ah, you didn't come with chief? Where are the bags of rice and wrappers?"" She asked in one breath. God, I was enraged. This woman didn't even feel any pity for exploiting me! But then again, could I complain? I gave her the power to exploit me, so I had to either endure her or put a stop to it. Right then, I knew exactly which option I was ticking. ""There are no bags of rice or any more money! I came to tell you that your services are no longer needed, madam!"" She paused for a while, then laughed. ""You don't mean it!"" ""Oh, I mean every single word!"" I said, squeezing the words out through my gritted teeth. The woman studied me for a while, then shrugged. ""But you can't just ask me to stop being your mother. Chief will find out and you will be finished. It's better to pay me and keep me happy. A happy mother-in-law is a happy family!"" I glared at the woman for her audacious words. I felt like slapping her so hard that she'd run and hide in the sands! If only she knew that at that moment, I had nothing to lose! ""Just stay away. You will no longer get any money or benefits. Don't ever come near me again!"" I turned to leave, but she called me back and poured every colourful threat she knew. ""I'll tell Chima. You will be sorry. He will know what a lying idiot you are!"" I ignored her and left. My next stop was the village. I was nervous. Ten years of absence wasn't a joke. When I arrived, my little sister hissed and went inside. I couldn't blame her much. She looked so thin and underfed that her bones were showing through. I swallowed the guilt and went in. My mother saw me and fell on her knees. When I saw this, my heart skipped. Just like ten years ago when I'd fallen on my knees before her. But this time, there was no anger. Not from me nor from her. .... Chima. I was still wallowing in my internal conflict when the doorbell rang. I didn't feel like meeting anyone–and I wasn't expecting anyone. I felt that maybe Celine had come back! I rushed to the door and opened, but instead of Celine, I saw her fake mother standing there with a deep scowl on her face. She went on to tell me all the lies Celine had been telling. The only thing she didn't know was that I already knew. As she talked, I realised one crucial fact. Celine really did love me. Why then would she go to lengths of lying just to keep me with her? When has she exploited me for money or favours aside from the times she asked for a new phone and hand bag? When? I smiled at the woman for waking me up. ""Thank you!"" I said and pushed her out. I changed, grabbed my car keys and left the house. It was time I dumped my judgemental character.

facebook,"Vice President Sara Duterte on Thursday urged Filipinos to call for a ceasefire as war rages in the Middle East. Duterte, who's also the education secretary, said Filipinos should not take sides because everyone loses in a war, especially children. ""Ako ay nananawagan sa aking kapwa Pilipino na ipahayag ang isang tigil putukan at dalhin ang usapin ng kapayapaan sa mesa,"" she said in a video posted on Facebook. ""Ating ipanawagan ang pagkakaisa ng mga partido upang maglabas ng kolektibong pananawagan para sa pangmatagalang kapayapaan,"" she added. The vice president said the war inflicts harm not only those Filipinos living in affected areas but also their families left in the Philippines who are relying on them for financial support. She also warned of possible hardships caused by the unrest including food security. Duterte did not specifically mention Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas – who have been fighting in Gaza for several days already. As of Thursday, the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed that at least four Filipinos have died in the escalating conflict. | via CNN Philippines #PanayNews",,187,"{'like_count': 31, 'comment_count': 35, 'num_users': 607933}",Panay News,,2023-10-20 04:00:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339339715_586746643515779_5344540185653088573_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3RSm9W2ACpoAX8AJECw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCLildwcnqYdB5lh_xr4TUvlCsOZkM3bFXkNoIhFhqo5w&oe=6559BAA8,https://www.facebook.com/100064468400964/posts/717283770430563,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394267186_717283717097235_1351589260736214066_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ui-n0LX_efAAX-0tYLh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD9NyuEBAFJLQHO1WwKNFkrLV5d1agvXxaYwKvRlxf_YA&oe=6537FE18

facebook,"FEATURE FRIDAY Post 3 of 3 Tee O'Fallon Author I just had a new book release on Monday – Above ’N’ Beyond, the seventh and final book in my Federal K-9 series. For this one, I took a really deep dive into conflict and emotional wounds that drive characters to do what they do, make the decisions they make. It added so many layers to the story. That’s why I think this is one of the best books I’ve ever written. There’s so much juicy angst and meat to Jamie’s and Bella’s fears, hopes and dreams, and especially, their character arcs. Here’s the back cover blurb to whet your appetite. I do hope you’ll check out this book! Deep secrets. Deadly truths. Getting locked up had been easy. But for K-9 Sergeant Jamie Pataglio, going undercover at a maximum-security prison—and infiltrating the Mancusco crime family—was the hard part. Now, six months later, Jamie’s been accepted as one of the mob’s own, and he’s walking out of the gates as a free man…and stepping into the criminal underworld. There’s only one small, gorgeous problem: Bella Bianco. The Italian bistro used to be Bella’s pride and joy. Now it’s become a nightmare, where her violent family uses her restaurant as its criminal home base. Guilty by association. She needs to find a way out, and fast. The last thing Bella needs is an attraction to their newest “associate”—even if every moment alone with him leaves her breathless. It’s almost enough to make her reconsider her “no mobsters” policy… They can’t trust each other. But if either of them ever wants to break free of their circumstances, they don’t have a choice. They’ll have to take down her family. And if anyone finds out they’re working together…they’re both dead. https://teeofallon.com/above-n-beyond/ Have a great weekend, everyone!",,185,"{'like_count': 119, 'comment_count': 45, 'num_users': 357607}",Lori Foster,,2023-10-20 21:00:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/399269451_894330975382295_8312848521480525350_n.jpg?stp=c28.31.526.527a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=a2R-2sTqAaoAX-IaqP3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBkmoQTa9oBq0YjbuqOM9IaCLWxLKA0V5jGORuznDeABg&oe=6559F28E,https://www.facebook.com/100044162032777/posts/883436826471710,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393694931_883435079805218_6305694641436246765_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=VYAy6cIZeRwAX_-8tTU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAqzVSKGHP7CAjzFNivmNumuOsaY8RH-YI0dXGKD6Mi7w&oe=65449B33

Israel continued to pummel the Gaza Strip overnight with airstrikes, amid warnings that Israeli forces could invade the Hamas-ruled territory at any time. The Israel Defense Forces posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: “During the night, fighter jets attacked over a hundred operational targets of the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, destroying tunnel shafts, munitions warehouses and dozens of operational headquarters.” Meanwhile, Israel is planning to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona. Authorities said Friday that the town’s residents will be placed in state-funded guest houses. The northern city is located near Israel’s border with Lebanon and has been subjected to numerous rocket and missile attacks from Palestinian militant groups. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak travels Friday to Egypt, his latest Middle Eastern destination, as the conflict continues to grow.

facebook,"The black bear has risen in stature to one of our state’s most valued animals – by wildlife watchers and hunters alike. Maine’s expansive northern, eastern, and western forest supports the largest population of black bears in the eastern United States, and MDIFW’s black bear monitoring program is one of the most extensive and longest-running programs of its type in the U.S. Our bear management program strives to balance biological and social needs and uses long-term monitoring of black bears, harvest data, and conflict data to inform management decisions. Maine’s 10-year big game management plan includes goals, objectives, and a series of management strategies designed to ensure continued enjoyment of black bears without too many conflicts in backyards and neighborhoods.

facebook,"Kaže jedan mainstream medij, ""U Iraku se trenutno nalaze 2500 američkih vojnika te još 900 u susjednoj Siriji, u sklopu misije čiji je cilj pomoći lokalnim snagama u borbi protiv Islamske države, koja je 2014. zauzela dijelove teritorija obje zemlje"". Skidanjem vela propagande s ove evaluacije, ona bi otprilike zvučala ovako; Američki je ratni stroj pod danas prokazano lažnim rezonom 2003. započeo brutalan rat u Iraku, koji je rezultirao humanitarnom katastrofom i radikalizacijom domaćeg stanovništva spram zapada. Ta je radikalizacija u idejnom smislu uvelike pripomogla kasnijem nastanku terorističke Islamske države, koja je pak u praksi nastala kao posljedica CIA-ove tzv. Timber Sycamore inicijative - planskim financiranjem, naoružavanjem i treniranjem pobunjeničkih snaga ponajprije u Siriji. Sirijski građanski rat, koji je tu zemlju doveo od relativno funkcionalne države do niza ruševina, sukreirao je pak migrantsku krizu 2015., čije posljedice zapad u velikoj mjeri ponovno osjeća i danas. Nakon svih tih dokazano katastrofalnih, anti-humanih, destabilizirajućih i ratno-manijakalnih poteza, američki establišment svoje građane i dalje drži na istom tom teritoriju, kako bi ""pomagali"" s krizama koje je njihovo vodstvo samo kreiralo. Spomenute su posljedice sada nanovo zapaljene produbljivanjem izraelsko-palestinskog sukoba, koje je započelo tako što je pod iznimno sumnjivim okolnostima teroristička organizacija Hamas uspjela padobranima probiti najneprobojniju državnu (izraelsku) granicu na svijetu, a američki je establišment pred UN-om javno odbio rezoluciju o prekidu vatre, dok se istovremeno kiti perjem mirotvorca na teritoriju kojeg je, kako se vidi iz gore navedenog, kontinuirano napadao, potpirivao i destabilizirao ovisno o svojim geopolitičkim interesima. Jedini period relativnog mira na svim navedenim teritorijima trajao je za vrijeme mandata anti-establišmentskog Trumpa, kojeg je isti taj establišment, pripomognut mainstream medijima, sustavno prikazivao kao luđaka pod čijom ćemo ludosti pasti u treći svjetski rat. Inače, a propos posljednje izraelske krize, valja se prisjetiti i javne izjave iz 80-ih godina aktualnog predsjednika Bidena, koji je tada rekao da bi SAD trebao izmisliti Izrael zbog svojih interesa na Bliskom istoku kada on ne bi postojao. *** Dok mainstream mediji nastavljaju poslušnički kreirati realnost podobnu sistemu, svatko bi se na ovakvim primjerima trebao prisjetiti koliko je svijet zapravo drukčiji od onoga što nam svakodnevna sistemska propaganda servira.",,173,"{'like_count': 129, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 2891}",Sapere Aude,,2023-10-20 11:45:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/291468737_157523230161096_8624451078301626242_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=JralE2IPPf4AX9xvRZR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC4fXFY7NE-ud0s2i0c-dfH6eCIBMgK5Y81OG0kZ8Fc-Q&oe=655AC05C,https://www.facebook.com/100077028956470/posts/334305825813713,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393976308_334305029147126_8797150441478651775_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7DxHZMee2mUAX_iNllk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAakHxOBV2S3O9W0OlljfoeqXsleBxNb73iiivlVH_DfQ&oe=65380EB9

facebook,"A few months after The Treaty is put before the Dáil to vote on, an election in June 1922 is put before the Irish people. Here are some results and impartial analysis: In June 1922 an Irish general election was held for the Irish population. Sinn Fein were campaigning as Pro-Treaty (Collins side) and Anti-Treaty (De Valera’s side). Here are the results. (I’ve seen discrepancies of 2-300 votes in various history books). SF Pro-Treaty: Popular vote - 239,193 38.1% 58 seats SF Anti-Treaty: Popular vote - 135,864 21.8% 36 seats Many had voted for other parties. Labour made huge gains nearly on a par with the anti-Treaty side. This also showed signs of a general population growing tired of conflict after 1916 and the 1919-21 War of Independence. Labour Party Popular vote: 132,565 21.3% 17 seats Interestingly Labour, Farmers Party, Businessmen’s Party and Independents all supported the Treaty and secured 247,080 votes, more than both SF Pro-Treaty and Anti-Treaty 75% of the Irish electorate were in favor of The Treaty just before the Irish Civil War 1922-23 was to break out. Also non Sinn Fein parties (pro or anti-Treaty) had support from over 40% of the Irish electorate. Of the 22 seats in Dublin spread over 5 constituencies only 1 of 6 anti-Treaty Sinn Fein candidates had won. Margaret Pearse mother of Patrick Pearse, Kathleen Clarke, widow of Tom Clarke and Constance Markievicz all lost their seats. Margaret Pearse failed to be elected because of the lack of second preference votes. Another interesting point is that Sinn Fein anti-Treaty had taken part in an election in line with Article 11 of The Treaty even though it was seen as partitionist in nature. Article 11 had limited the election to only 26 counties excluding Northern Ireland. Within 12 days the Irish Civil War would break out when the Pro-Treaty government bombarded the Four Courts.",,170,"{'like_count': 136, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 34723}",Easter Rising Stories,,2023-10-20 16:16:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/324589998_1374664513334965_9063822707818881612_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=e5kUisHleS8AX8QjjWL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA_2FuQAxGH_ufVMdPQr798OmrkjeTWnFhSdxDy_9o3rA&oe=655B1EE6,https://www.facebook.com/100064738900976/posts/719269326907691,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392931708_719269370241020_8351644006361420822_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=b2W1dVOEZAkAX-97t4b&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBMXRZppvhx4vNgshv9eR6taErN3r5EdlJ218ZBWGlDTw&oe=6537E4A7

facebook,"Facts about Israel and Palestine: 1. Palestinians living in Israel enjoy more rights than Palestinians in the Gaza . This includes women's rights, property ownership, political participation,voting rights, access to abortions and civil rights protections including affirmative action. 2. Israel is a diverse country, not an ""ethnostate."" Jews make up approximately 70% of the population, Arabs about 20%, with the remaining composed of various ethnicities. 3. Palestinian"" does not represent a single ethnicity. Palestine was historically a territory, not a nation-state, consisting of diverse ethnic groups, including Jewish people. 4. The Israeli government is not monolithic; it consists of a politically diverse parliament (Knesset) with different ethnicities and political parties. Socialistic parties have held office. 5. Prior to the establishment of Israel, Palestine was not a recognized state; it was a sparsely populated territory inhabited by both Jews and Arabs, with a total population of under 2 million. This includes Holocaust survivors. 6. Since the establishment of Israel, the population of Gaza and the Palestinian territories has grown significantly and ranks 13th in the world. 7. Israel withdrew its military from Gaza in 2005, after which Hamas suspended elections and ruled with strict enforcement of Islamic law. 8. The United Nations, which created the legal framework for addressing genocide, does not classify the Israel-Palestine conflict as genocide or ethnic cleansing 9. Early Jewish settlers were not ""colonists""; they were refugees , Holocaust survivors and migrants fleeing persecution. 10. The estimated population of early Israel was about 800,000, including both Jews and Arabs. 11. There is no “free Palestine “ with Hamas in control 12. Israel has policies that require critical examination, especially concerning human rights issues in Gaza. However, as mentioned earlier, Israel's political landscape is not monolithic. There are diverse viewpoints, including both right-wing and left-wing perspectives, on civil rights and foreign policy, as seen in other industrialized nations. And like other democratic nations , these divisions produce mixed results , some good , others bad , and never ideal. Criticizing Israeli policies and holding the government accountable for its actions is not inherently antisemitic, but reducing jewish Israelis to a singular entity and calling for the complete destruction of the state absolutely is",,168,"{'like_count': 38, 'comment_count': 102, 'num_users': 37279}",The Skeptical Libertarian,,2023-10-20 13:59:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/398838729_736169978551289_1852483446584680854_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=1awI8ritefYAX9ZFLMF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAB7Pu8A1cAUSAWi8iCupbTaaqTxFo7qIsl_LUtXbCD7g&oe=655B8835,https://www.facebook.com/100064748794261/posts/726898722811748,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394496475_726897082811912_3735534332164882147_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4qxLH8U-vO0AX_Ys0K5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCY2pGQwD0AS204nW8ZwqE8OhYOuNU9PjEqlwt1ud-bSA&oe=6559F7BB

facebook,"The World Health Organization said Thursday that five trucks full of medical supplies are ready at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, with hopes that the aid could be delivered to Palestinian hospitals as early as Friday. ""Our trucks are loaded and ready to go,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. The delivery of aid would be the first since Israel imposed a complete blockade on the Gaza Strip, following the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that killed over 1,400 Israelis. Health authorities in the Gaza Strip said Thursday that at least 3,785 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli bombardment since the latest conflict erupted. While aid continues to build up on the Egyptian side of the crossing, Egypt is not allowing Palestinians to cross from Gaza into the Egyptian Sinai peninsula. Following a meeting on Wednesday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said such an exodus of people from Gaza would jeopardize Palestinian aspirations of statehood. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced from their land in past conflicts with Israel, with many settling in Egypt and other neighboring states. Many refugees have never been allowed to return — and the regions fear the wider implications of Palestinians being forced to flee Gaza, said analyst Chris Doyle, director of the London-based Council for Arab-British Understanding. https://www.voanews.com/a/egypt-wary-of-opening-gaza-border-to-palestinian-refugees/7318041.html",,165,"{'like_count': 97, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 13090753}",Voice of America,,2023-10-20 06:30:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352992991_178766095145684_5027481947854717491_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=18ZZdScV7x8AX_v3UtK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA-0oRGDfzOgJKAktJbxD6u7JzyNcJUAbbN0bpHjZ8-Q&oe=655A6AC2,https://www.facebook.com/100064458353336/posts/715557287269543,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394511251_715556543936284_104700205495841098_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=PtqevUtDL5cAX8gX9Zo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDLh40ZM00SyB6UhHRvsWrQRPijg6dnYbEcu-UHMgihNA&oe=6537F2AA

Adebimpe spent two weeks at the hospital due to the illness. She was unable to do anything, it was Josiah and Mr Charles that do come often to check on her to the extent Josiah almost had a clash with Mr Charles because of how he do visit Adebimpe. The doctor gave her some medication to be taking while at home. The cause of what happened to her wasn’t detected because it looks strange. Her body looks so rough like chicken pox growth from the skin. But thankfully the treatment she was given helped her to regain  strength. She was told not to stress herself in anyway in other not to make it worse, the doctor said it looks more like spiritual and it’s by God’s grace that she survived it. All along she definitely knew the de vil in her house that would have wanted her dea d. She has no other thoughts than Faridah. She’s the only one who has been having conflict with her in the house. She has no choice than to call her daughter and informed her about her circumstances. Adesewa didn’t hesitate before returning back home because of  what her mother said. 

“My dear, please help me with that herbs.” She said to her daughter who sat at the chair opposite her. She gave her the herbs to drink and she thanked her. 

“Mother, what should I prepare for you?.” She asked her mother.

“Don’t worry oko mí (my darling) I will let you know when I’m hungry and moreover I can’t even wait to bounce back to my normal self so that you can return to your school.” She said.

“Noo na mother, your health is my first priority. If you’re well, my school is nothing to be worried about. My prayer is for you to get better.” She answered.

She smiles and told her to come closer as she peck her forehead.

“You are a darling and I love you so much.” She said smiling.

“I love you more mother, you’re the best in The whole world!.” She answered and laughed.

Someone knock at the door and Adesewa opened it for Nkechi to enter.

“How are you feeling now mama sewa?.” She asked sitting on the chair.

“I am fine oo mama Chinedu, thank you so much for your care and I’m really grateful.”

“It’s okay (smiling) what are we family for if not to help each other.” She said. I brought this medication soup for you and I’m very sure it will help also.”

“Thank you mama Chinedu may God bless you for me.” Adebimpe said.

“Amen ooo ehn’ I even want to tell you something but I don’t want Adesewa to be here.” She said and Adebimpe order sewa to excuse them. 

“So, what is it?.” She asked wondering what she’s about to say.

“You see something mama sewa, I have wanted to this ooo but I don’t know how you might react to it.”

“Please say it. I might learn one or two things from it.” Adebimpe answered as she drink the soup she brought.

“It Is about this thing that happened to you, because if by looking at things. Mama Rihannat behavior looks so glaring about what might be going on in this house. And you know how she has been behaving with us in this house.” She said trying to manipulate her mind to fight with faridah.

“Thank you! I know, I know that she’s the one behind my predicament. Can’t you see how she feels less concerned about what happened to me? I have been wishing for my quick recovery so that I can deal with her very well. Just leave her ooo ….”

“Ehn’ehn!.” Nkechi shouted.

“She will tell me what I buy from her that she want to ki ll me before my time. She has forgotten God doesn’t prosper the handwork of the enemy, she thinks she can hunt me down Never! I say Never!! Mama Chinedu. I will deal with her ehn infact she will turn to air that  can’t be seen again by the time I squeezed the hell out of her! .”

“very good! I will support you mama sewa! I think that day will be her last day in this house. A senior wife that can’t respect herself instead of fighting her junior to the extent of casting spell ha! Mama sewa that’s just too much! If is me ehn I will break her into pieces, even if our husband tried to separate us, he will also be dealt with.” Nkechi said in annoyance.

“Just don’t worry, at least I’m getting better already. Common to show concern, she didn’t . I know she might be plotting another way to get me, but my God is bigger than her. She will see!.” Adebimpe said aggressively, that one could even see her veins in line of her vibration.

Nkechi told her to calm down but within her she was really happy that she is able to achieve what she wanted. 

“I hope you’re hearing from your boss? Mr charms or is it Charles.” Nkechi asked making Adebimpe to laugh.

“It is Charles ooo marma Chinedu. Well, he called me this morning but I just lied to him that I’m already fine .” She answered.

“Ehya!.” Nkechi said while wondering in her mind on why he would still be calling her when her husband has warned him to abstain from Adebimpe. And the man is nice oooo.” She said beaming.

“Yes oo and he has been wonderful, I won’t lie.” Adebimpe said.

“And he is (truncated)",,163,"{'like_count': 144, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 37670}",Faith stories backup page,,2023-10-20 12:14:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/335296188_507637391571491_7341205445125768015_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=vMB7W8UMX_gAX-izNy3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfApgpChisYom-Z8KoJ3rbpF1ulfciR2GRYzCbU-eok58g&oe=655A307C,https://www.facebook.com/100090499716402/posts/261649300195059,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394190399_295313633264741_2166722625297229080_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CIk1QDDYJLIAX9sIOwd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAMqEQ079Ky5tJcfvHu9W3krB-NUwwSFa8BKBPc0mT_og&oe=65384997

facebook,"Cloaked in stillness, the Poppy Man stands, A somber sentinel on hallowed ground. His presence evokes memories profound, Of valiant souls who gave their all, In a conflict that left the world enthralled. Near Banbury Cross, he takes his stand, A poignant reminder of those who fell, Their sacrifices etched upon our land. The poppy he bears, a symbol of rest, For those who now eternally rest. Linked to Armistice Day, that day of yore, When the guns fell silent, and hope was reborn, The poppy stands as a beacon, forevermore, A reminder of the price that was paid, For the freedoms we so often take for granted. As we pass by, let us pause and reflect, On the sacrifices made, and the lives that were wrecked. Let us honour their memory, with reverence and grace, And vow to never forget, the fallen of that fateful place. For in their silence, they speak volumes untold, Of courage and valor, of duty and pride. Let their stories inspire us, as we grow old, To cherish the peace, for which they died. So as you see the Poppy Man stand, Remember the fallen, and lend a helping hand. For in their memory, we must all strive, To build a world where peace will forever thrive. Pictured. The new installation next to Banbury Cross.

facebook,"Dear BSHAA, Thank you for your latest communication. I would like to commence by publicly stating my intentions of terminating my BSHAA membership. I would have like to have done so with immediate effect; however, prior to doing so I would need to ensure all BSHAA logos and associated acronyms are removed entirely from my website etc. I do not wish to be affiliated with a membership body like yourselves who hold little or no regard to the genuine concerns of it’s own membership and the health and safety of the general public. In direct response to your latest mailing, I can confirm that any comments made by myself are non-defamatory and non-libellous. They are based on facts. For example, some BSHAA accredited ear wax removal courses ARE training lay-people when it comes to ears (i.e. people with no previous ear experience or qualifications). In addition, there is a clear UNDECLARED conflict of interest, with certain individuals on the BSHAA Council affiliated with national high-street chains that actively train their receptionists to perform ear wax removal. Furthermore, one of the abovementioned individuals is a ‘Key Author’ on the proposed ‘Aural Care Register’ (ACR). All other statements of mine are opinions and redacted statements from various individuals. On the contrary, I am aware of certain BSHAA Council Members who have made defamatory and libellous comments about myself through direct messages sent to other members. These messages have been forwarded to me and which I now hold in my safe possession. It is great that you have finally provided a further definition of an Associate Wax Member to your membership. It is now clear that any individual who has successfully completed a BSHAA-accredited aural care (wax removal) course (and we know there are such courses who train quite literally anybody) and meet the requirements outlined for both initial and continuing registration is eligible to become an Associate Wax Member. This could therefore include beauticians, electricians, plumbers, tattooists and of course, receptionists at high-street hearing centres. With regards to the 3-month reflective post-training period and the current internal discussions you seem to be having about what it may include, you seem to be getting a bit ahead of yourselves I feel on this, don’t you think? I thought the ACR is still out for public consultation and if it is the will of the membership you won’t proceed with it? Interestingly, you make reference to the BSA Minimum Training Guidelines first drafted in August 2020 and which is due for review in August 2025. You may have missed a very important point when you did, in such that these minimal guidelines are for ‘Aural Care delivered by Hearing Health Care Professionals’. This is in bold and enlarged font on the front cover of the document. I don’t believe beauticians, electricians, plumbers, tattooists and of course receptionists at high-street hearing centres qualify as ‘Hearing Health Care Professionals’, do you? You claim that BSHAA’s development of the ACR is ‘entirely altruistic’ and BSHAA makes no profit from accrediting training courses. Would you say this is also true of some of the high-street companies that a couple of BSHAA Council Members are affiliated with, one also being a Key Author in the ACR document? I should also advise that some of the potentially hundreds of poorly trained people you eluded to in our sector have attended BSHAA accredited courses, with many being employed by the very same high-street companies that some BSHAA Council Members are affiliated with. All the public criticism that BSHAA have encountered in recent weeks is well deserved and justified. You have published a proposed ACR documentation for public consultation not clearly defining the term ‘Associate Wax Member’ and without providing members with all the poll and survey results (and have still yet to do so). I should add these results are now void because both members and the public up until now did not fully understand what an ‘Associate Wax Member’ meant. Instead of re-conducting (and independently at that) the members poll and both members and public surveys like any respectable membership body would in light of this newly provided critical piece of information, BSHAA are once again doubling-down on their position and pursing the ACR proposal. With regards to the further wider private representation BSHAA is seeking onto The National Dewax Access Group, could you advise who these representations are? They are not a particular BSHAA accredited private ear wax removal training course provider that train quite literally anybody such as receptionists at high-street hearing chains, are they? If so, this would be a CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST. Yes, I know... To conclude, please be aware that I shall be continuing to strongly oppose your ACR proposal even if not within BSHAA. I shall also continue to educate the public about the potential risks to their healthy and (truncated)",,160,"{'like_count': 104, 'comment_count': 19, 'num_users': 153290}",The Hear Clinic,,2023-10-20 17:19:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/378387437_697396875765018_2398950597627266490_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=AmVwflHGBQUAX8tMGHw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDlsbpMyYAC3oGlJFULLAH1q5OFULBork_DS3J_wVdmWQ&oe=655A919C,https://www.facebook.com/100064841342199/posts/719476043557101,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394567191_719475403557165_7885203244390533992_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=h2ADe_93ty4AX_7cGFV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCFhFuVHIXuS5Z0lRLlX735s2y1R9GUmlfK7cKy9fW5fQ&oe=654B77BE

facebook,"🎯 Sancho is prohibited from eating with or communicating with his Manchester United teammates after his suspension The winger trains separately at the Manchester United academy. The Daily Mail notes that the player has to lock his door when he changes because of rules stipulating that first-team players should not mix with academy players. Let us remember that in early September a conflict arose between Sancho and Manchester United head coach Erik ten Hag. The winger missed the match of the 4th round of the Premier League with Arsenal (1:3). After the game, Erik ten Hag explained this by saying that the 23-year-old Englishman had not impressed him in training.

facebook,"Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas has condemned the Philippine government’s expression of support to Israel amid the ongoing armed conflict over the Middle East as thousands of innocent Palestinians have been killed. In a statement on Thursday, Brosas said that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. should not have made an outright support for Israel’s actions, and similarly, should have refrained from calling Hamas militants a terrorist group. Last October 11, Marcos said the Philippines stands with Israel, which suffered an all-out attack from Hamas last October 7. “We strongly condemn President Marcos Jr.’s outright support to Israel at a time when thousands of Palestinians are being slaughtered and driven out of their land,” Brosas said. “Expressing sadness is not enough. While some world leaders express their condemnation against Israel’s actions, it is disheartening to see the Philippine government offering ‘moral support’ to apartheid Israel and declaring Hamas as a terrorist organization,” she added. While it was Hamas that brought the fight to Israel through an aerial, land, and sea attack, the militant group soon found itself hammered after Israeli forces fought back though missile strikes. Estimates from the United Nations (UN) show that the death toll due to the conflict is already around 4,300 — of which 1,300 are Israeli nationals and the remaining 3,000 are Palestinians. Israel has also faced scrutiny for the way it fought back, as it was accused of indiscriminately bombing structures in Gaza, including hospitals where wounded Palestinians — including children, women, and the elderly — were being treated. “Israel should not be given preferential treatment or be considered above the law just because they are backed by notorious war-mongerer United States,” Brosas claimed. “These relentless acts of violence perpetrated by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are clear violations of international humanitarian law and must also be condemned by the international community,” she added. Aside from not extending a message of solidarity, Brosas also urged the Philippine government to file diplomatic protests against Israel to end the killing of civilians in Gaza, while reassessing the Philippines’ relationship with the Middle Eastern country. “Thousands of Palestinians are killed every day right before our eyes. It is time to reassess the Philippines’ relationship with Israel and take a principled stand against these grave human rights violations,” she noted. Earlier, Basilan Rep. Mujiv Hataman urged his fellow lawmakers from the House to join in calling for an end to hostilities between Israel and Hamas. Hataman said he intends to file a resolution calling for an immediate end to the horrific violence against innocent civilians, women, children and the elderly. This call from the lawmaker came just after the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) announced that a fourth Filipino had just died during the war between Israel and Hamas. Israel, believed to have one of the world’s best air defenses, was taken by surprise after Hamas launched an all-out assault including missile strikes from Gaza last October 7. Analysts believe that the attack heightened Middle East tensions again to levels unseen since the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War. Hamas has threatened to kill Israeli captives every time a civilian building is bombed by Israel’s forces. However, there have also been questions raised against Israel as it was accused of committing rights abuses themselves — like extrajudicial killings against innocent Palestines, who have been merely seeking independence from Israel. Hamas also questioned Israel’s indiscriminate missile strikes, which has targeted buildings housing innocent Palestinians. This week, a hospital in Gaza was hit by a blast which Israel and Hamas blamed at each other. | via Inquirer #PanayNews",,151,"{'like_count': 24, 'comment_count': 47, 'num_users': 607933}",Panay News,,2023-10-20 02:45:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339339715_586746643515779_5344540185653088573_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3RSm9W2ACpoAX8AJECw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCLildwcnqYdB5lh_xr4TUvlCsOZkM3bFXkNoIhFhqo5w&oe=6559BAA8,https://www.facebook.com/100064468400964/posts/717266270432313,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394287147_717266180432322_6512658240952738469_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=KZlsmiTZXPQAX-d607G&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBQNe44MIWUvpWmUgTBZkK4UrwXSjgIF0V-p5O-3PgVUQ&oe=655764D4

The mass oath-taking was held during a joint meeting of the Provincial Peace and Order Council and the Provincial Anti-Drug Abuse Council at the Ceremonial Hall in the New Capitol Building, Tagbilaran City, Bohol. Out of the 61 members, two (2) had previously served as Chairperson of HUMABOL (Hugpong Mag-uumang Bol-anon) and Old TTIFA (Talibon-Trinidad Integrated Farmers Association), both under the umbrella of the Kilusang Mambubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP). They took their oath before Bohol Governor Erico Aristotle Aumentado, with the collaborative efforts of the Provincial Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (PTF-ELCAC), the 47th Infantry Battalion, and the Bohol Police Provincial Office. LTC Magno M Mapalad III, the Commanding Officer of the 47IB, attended the event, along with PCol.

Coopting CTG-influenced Sectoral Front Organizations (SFOs) and rendering them ineffective redound to diminishing amount of financial and logistical resources the CTG receive from its Urban Operations to support its armed members operating in the Red Areas. ""These 61 individuals are mass supporters. They were part of People's Organizations in Bohol that are affiliated with the CTG. However, they were coopted and redirected onto the path of peace because they saw the sincerity of the government. A kind of government that is more than ready to embrace and provide them with opportunities that will help them rebuild their lives with the mainstream society. It is a fact that our efforts in putting an end to local armed conflict is futile without the support of the LGUs and the Province of Bohol have continually proven that,"" MGen Sison concluded. #𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 #𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿𝗔𝗿𝗺𝘆𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝘆 #𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗱 #𝗔𝗙𝗣𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗰𝗮𝗻𝗧𝗥𝗨𝗦𝗧 #𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗣𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗔𝗿𝗺𝘆 #𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗦𝗮𝗕𝗮𝘆𝗮𝗻 #𝗟𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱𝗯𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 #TerroristsWorstNightmare #𝗽𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗺𝘆𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝑭𝒐𝒓 𝒎𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒖𝒑𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒔, 𝒑𝒉𝒐𝒕𝒐𝒔 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒐𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆, 𝒔𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑭𝑶𝑳𝑳𝑶𝑾 𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒑𝒂𝒈𝒆!",,146,"{'like_count': 83, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 249742}",Philippine Army Spearhead Troopers,,2023-10-20 08:47:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/336888590_6256921364326531_6541009437006587378_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=N-E_NFSB56oAX_gezJr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD3F4aQK6_LppNkZ1rT7540U6iS4yH_k7ARdw5c_rmGSg&oe=655B7222,https://www.facebook.com/100064758784105/posts/718938280274792,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394257122_718938226941464_7075144220549829452_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=oM3ux-wcDrQAX-OF0YI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCL5jXsSwlp_mfYnnfXionQ1EHP_hwFvNm7v20qC5oimw&oe=653692C5

facebook,"HIGHER EVERYDAY SATURDAY OCTOBER 21, 2023 RESOLVING RIFTS MEMORY VERSE: “And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you” (Ephesians 4:32). TEXT: EPHESIANS 4:29-32 A Rift is described as serious disagreement that disrupts good relations. Harriet B. Braiker insists that, “Conflict can and should be handled constructively; when it is, relationships benefit. Conflict avoidance is ‘not’ the hallmark of a good relationship. On the contrary, it is a symptom of serious problems and of poor communication.” Conflict can arise everywhere and anywhere because all of us have our own interests, personalities, thought processes and reactions. As believers, it is wise to question the situation, analyze and resolve the problem with prayer, God’s Word and Spirit guidance rather than letting it linger. We can resolve conflicts by accommodating, collaborating, and making compromises. Our memory verse states that in times of rift, we need to forgive one another. We need to be kind and tenderhearted as disagreements are not resolved if each of the contending parties remains bitter and unforgiving. If you are a mediator, listen actively with empathy and avoid partiality, so that the outcome would be adjudged to be fair and just by all. Christians should endeavour to “… live peaceably with all men” (Romans 12:18). QUOTE: We need to forgive one another. CHALLENGE: Let conflict not rob you of your faith. PRAYER: Holy Father, help me to peacefully settle all my rifts with others. https://dailymanna.app",,140,"{'like_count': 114, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 409384}",Deeper Life Family Worldwide,,2023-10-20 21:41:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/120453422_120325283151955_5895498725484708112_n.jpg?stp=c14.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=8qhsUntfoDoAX9T1Em4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBtl4mtsfDEsaNwSoZ8lG6Bpy5v7XPXNdNPR778iFQKRg&oe=657D1489,https://www.facebook.com/groups/625050584517227/permalink/2161513917537545,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393781265_1263257821030752_2766314527331872869_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=C4EPe6SY_HIAX8xTjoq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAJ33UxBfSgvynCNsW1GyLVgvdKV_pRGdBcJsxQN2iPpA&oe=65374EED

She appears to us on Her tiger, looking completely serene and composed, dressed in a red silk sari and carrying various weapons and tools in her eight to eighteen arms. In the Hindu traditions Mata Durga is the Divine Mother Goddess who presides over the seasons of life, death, and birth. To many, She is simply DEVI, which means ‘Goddess’ and comes from the sanskrit ‘Deva’, which means ‘to shine’. She is the Great Mother who helps us removing the limitations and emotional and mental obscurations that prevent us from shining the Divine Light we all carry within our hearts. Durga, which means the invincible, unconquerable and unassailable one, is the name this powerful and courageous Goddess takes after Her defeat of the buffalo-headed demon Durgama. She teaches us that the divine light of truth and wisdom will always prevail over disorder and pain. The Devi Mahatmya is a dramatic narration of the different battles the Great Goddess fights to stop all that is threatening the balance and harmony between humans and nature. Its various chapters describe how only the Great Goddess can stop the asuras (demons) that are causing so much bloodshed, violence and destruction on the earth. The demons represent the afflicted ego qualities in humans and Devi confronts the demons of arrogance, pride, hypocrisy, greed, rage, discrimination, injustice and more. ଶ୍ରୀଦଶମହାବିଦ୍ୟାକବଚମ୍ ବିନିଯୋଗଃ - ଓଁ ଅସ୍ୟ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାକବଚସ୍ୟ ଶ୍ରୀସଦାଶିବ ଋଷିଃ ଉଷ୍ଣିକ୍ ଛନ୍ଦଃ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟା ଦେବତା ସର୍ବସିଦ୍ଧିପ୍ରାପ୍ତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ପାଠେ ବିନିଯୋଗଃ ॥ ଋଷ୍ୟାଦି ନ୍ୟାସଃ - ଶ୍ରୀସଦାଶିବଋଷୟେ ନମଃ ଶିରସୀ ଉଷ୍ଣିକ୍ ଛନ୍ଦସେ ନମଃ ମୁଖେ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାଦେବତାୟୈ ନମଃ ହୃଦି ସର୍ବସିଦ୍ଧିପ୍ରାପ୍ତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ପାଠେ ବିନିଯୋଗାୟ ନମଃ ॥ ମାନସପୁଜନମ୍ - ଓଁ ଲଂ ପୃଥ୍ୱୀତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ଗନ୍ଧଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ସମର୍ପୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ହଂ ଆକାଶତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ପୁଷ୍ପଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ସମର୍ପୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ଯଂ ବାୟୁତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ଧୂପଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ଆଘ୍ରାପୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ରଂ ଅଗ୍ନିତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ଦୀପଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ଦର୍ଶୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ବଂ ଜଳତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ନୈବେଦ୍ୟଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ନିବେଦୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ସଂ ସର୍ବତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ତାମ୍ବୂଳଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ନିବେଦୟାମି ନମଃ ॥ ଅଥ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାକବଚମ୍ । ଓଁ ପ୍ରାଚ୍ୟାଂ ରକ୍ଷତୁ ମେ ତାରା କାମରୂପନିବାସିନୀ । ଆଗ୍ନେୟ୍ୟାଂ ଷୋଡଶୀ ପାତୁ ଯାମ୍ୟାଂ ଧୂମାବତୀ (truncated)",,139,"{'like_count': 100, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 64298}",ନୀଳାଦ୍ରିନାଥ ଶ୍ରୀଜଗନ୍ନାଥ । Neeladrinath Shri Jagannath,,2023-10-20 15:24:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/358623960_849747990042552_191255908297743546_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=qdcoQ5eheCsAX-PSoQa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC7LZ1espGIohKaYBuWc3bt3rTPlZnBbwMpCdJ65uCUBA&oe=655A8C19,https://www.facebook.com/100050220771132/posts/910684123948938,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393017833_910684140615603_580423008651713231_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=y1nsP3XKZVgAX-Yutvl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAYhGibSRCDrnE9pQkSYv60Y8c9yBlBw-3s-k8XQhC_kA&oe=653862D0
facebook,"🚨STATEMENT OF FC BAYERN MUNICH REGARDING NOUSSAIR MAZRAOUI FC Bayern Munich held a detailed and clarifying conversation with Noussair Mazraoui this week. The reason for the discussion was Mazraoui's Instagram posts in connection with the terror against Israel almost two weeks ago, which led to irritation and criticism. ""Noussair Mazraoui has credibly assured us that as a peace-loving person he resolutely rejects terror and war and he never meant to cause any irritation with his posts"", said Jan-Christian Dreesen, CEO of FC Bayern explaining, ""FC Bayern condemns Hamas' attack on Israel"" - ""Furthermore, Noussair Mazraoui declares, ""I condemn all terrorism and terrorist organizations."" FC Bayern and Noussair Mazraoui strongly oppose the transfer of the Middle East conflict and its violence to Germany, which is committed to peace. Hate and violence of any kind have no place in the political culture of Germany. FC Bayern stands by Germany's Jewish community and by Israel's side; nothing justifies the murder of children and families. FC Bayern believes that football should unleash its power of reconciliation between different cultures, especially in the most difficult moments. Noussair Mazraoui will remain in the FC Bayern squad, but is out of action due to an injury he sustained.

facebook,"Malaysian cave paintings: ancient depictions of conflict and courage Researchers have made a significant discovery by dating the drawings found in Gua Sireh Cave in Sarawak, shedding light on a story of conflict. This limestone cave in western Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, is renowned for its charcoal drawings adorning its chambers, attracting numerous visitors. The drawings depict Indigenous resistance to frontier violence in the 1600s and 1800s CE. Radiocarbon dating of the drawings has revealed their age to be between 280 and 120 cal BP (CE 1670 to 1830), aligning with a period of escalating conflict as Malay elites, who controlled the region, imposed heavy tolls on Indigenous hill tribes, including the Bidayuh.

TITLE : THE SADDUCEES

SCRIPTURE REFERENCE : ACTS 5:17, ACTS 23:8, MARK 12:18-27

Beloved welcome to today's lesson. In our lesson today we shall be discussing something about the Sadducees.

The Sadduccees were the party of high priests, aristocratic families, and merchants. They were the wealthy elements of population and they belong to a Jewish priestly sect that flourished for about two centuries before the destruction of the second Temple of Jerusalem in 70CE.

Not much is known about the Sadduccees' origin and early history but their name may be derived from that of Zadok who was a high priest in the time of King David and King Solomon. Ezekiel later selected this family as worthy of being entrusted with control of the Temple, and Zadokites formed the Temple hierarchy down to the 2nd Century BCE.

The Sadducees came under the influence of Hellenism, tended to have good relations with the Roman rulers of Palestine, and generally represented the conservative view within Judaism. While their rivals, the Pharisees, claimed the authority of piety and learning, the Sadducees claimed that of birth and social/economic position.

During the long period of the two parties' struggle which lasted until the Roman's destruction of Jerusalem in 70CE, the Sadducees dominated the Temple and it's Priesthood.

The Sadducees and Pharisees were in constant conflict with each other, not only over numerous details of ritual and the Law but most importantly over the content and extent of God's revelation to the Jewish people. 

The Sadducees refused to go beyond the written Torah ( first five books of the Old Testament) and thus, unlike the Pharisees, denied the immortality of the soul, bodily resurrection after death and according to the Acts Of The Apostles (23:8), the existence of angelic spirits.

Though the Sadducees were conservative in religious matters, their wealth, their haughty bearing and their willingness to compromise with the Roman rulers aroused the hatred of the common people. Their lives and political authority were so intimately bound up with the Temple worship that after Roman legions destroyed the Temple, the Sadducees ceased to exist as a group, and mention of them quickly disappeared from history.

Beloved this brings us to the end of today's lesson. We shall continue with our discussion in our next lesson.

God Richly Bless You All For Your Time In JESUS'NAME. Amen.

facebook,"When The Holy Spirit Comes As The Comforter, October 20
But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me. John 15:26. CTr 300.1
It is not right for us to devote time, brain, bone, and muscle to gathering in the things of earth and drop eternity out of our reckoning, but we should gather sheaves for the Master’s garner.... The Lord wants us to expand, to grow like the seed introduced into the soil—first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.... CTr 300.2
Some have asked, What shall I do to receive the Holy Ghost? Ask God to search your hearts as with a lighted candle. Do nothing for selfish gratification. Suppose that Christ’s professed followers were representatives of Christ in our earth; would not worldlings see this and take knowledge of such that they had learned of Jesus? Will not such be a power? We want the religion of Christ. This will bring forth the fruits of love, joy, and peace. The desire of the Master is not for a scanty supply, but to bear it in abundance. CTr 300.3
John 15:17-21 points to the opposition between Christ and the world, and to the persecution inflicted upon Christ and His followers.... We want to know Christ, whom to know aright is life eternal. In John 15 He points to trials, to conflicts. He asks if you can endure the conflict; then He points to eternal realities and shows you the thousands of angels sent to be ministers to those who are heirs of salvation. Though He shows the armies arrayed against you, yet He tells you that you need not be discouraged, for the Captain of the Lord’s host is with you, as with the Lord’s people in Joshua’s time.... What we want is to know how to fight the battle. The victory is not in the minister or the layperson, but in the Captain of the Lord’s host who fights the battle for us.... CTr 300.4
We fight not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places, and God is with us. CTr 300.5
We are not to consider that the smartness of men and women will bring success. People may have all the learning possible for a human being to comprehend, and yet they may be alone; without Christ they can do nothing. Do you walk humbly before Him? Have you a cherishing of inward sins, heartburnings against anyone? Are you seeking God with all your heart? We can bear to be separated from everything else but the Spirit of God. We want the inspiration of the cross, making us to fall helpless, and the Lord will lift us up.—Manuscript 27, 1891.

facebook,"Embark on a journey through the intriguing history of tank design, from the experimental days of World War I to the formidable war machines of World War II. In the early stages of tank warfare during WWI, these steel behemoths were experimental, often unreliable, and had limited mobility. Nonetheless, the experiences of this era laid the groundwork for groundbreaking innovations. As we advanced into WWII, tanks became swifter, heavily armoured, and better equipped for both offensive and defensive roles.

facebook,"VOA's Celia Mendoza reports from Re'im, Israel, as tensions in the region escalate. Israel continued to pummel the Gaza Strip overnight with airstrikes, amid warnings that Israeli forces could invade the Hamas-ruled territory at any time. The Israel Defense Forces posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: “During the night, fighter jets attacked over a hundred operational targets of the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, destroying tunnel shafts, munitions warehouses and dozens of operational headquarters.” Meanwhile, Israel is planning to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona. Authorities said Friday that the town’s residents will be placed in state-funded guest houses. The northern city is near Israel’s border with Lebanon and has been subjected to numerous rocket and missile attacks from Palestinian militant groups. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak travels Friday to Egypt, his latest Middle Eastern destination, as the conflict continues to grow. Sunak has already met with Israeli leaders and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. https://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-convoy-into-gaza-delayed/7319008.html",,125,"{'like_count': 47, 'comment_count': 31, 'num_users': 13090753}",Voice of America,,2023-10-20 20:00:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352992991_178766095145684_5027481947854717491_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=18ZZdScV7x8AX_v3UtK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA-0oRGDfzOgJKAktJbxD6u7JzyNcJUAbbN0bpHjZ8-Q&oe=655A6AC2,https://www.facebook.com/100064458353336/posts/715980967227175,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393498096_734599191832920_7765406145087594418_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=B5EXFELD8k8AX-5w7YI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC9hfVZiEQvm5aH7NO-YdJssPoXIj43vS2ztMwskQmfPg&oe=653818EC

facebook,"On 20th October 1496, the second daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile married Philip, Duke of Burgundy. The marriage was part of a double treaty. The bride’s brother, Juan, Prince of the Asturias (Crown Prince) was married to the groom’s sister, Marguerite of Austria. At the time of the marriage, Juana, as well as a brother, had an older sister living, so it was not anticipated that she would bring anything to the marriage other than her dowry. Philip, Duke of Burgundy since the death of his mother, Mary, when he was a small child, was the son of the Emperor Maximilian, and was likely to be Emperor himself in due course. The marriage, passionate at first, descended into utter misery, as Philip’s philandering enraged his wife, and her reaction, seen as hysterical and unseemly, become the talk of Europe. Both the siblings ahead of Juana in the succession died, leaving her as Queen of Castile in 1504. Philip tried to dominate the government of Castile, and came into conflict with Juana’s father, Ferdinand, who did not want to cede control. Philip died suddenly, and Juana spent most of the rest of her life held under restraint, first by her father, then her son, the Emperor Charles. There is an excellent book on Juana and her sister Katharine, by Julia Fox, read our review here. http://bit.ly/18urEhn:=:https://tudortimes.co.uk/books/book-reviews/sister-queens Pic shows altarpiece in Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Belgium.",,122,"{'like_count': 95, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 40904}",Tudor Times,,2023-10-20 07:00:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352002963_1429766097781902_8532214015450717758_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=REObFeuCJx0AX9Uh2s_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCBnyPD8__gteewkn-ksQdYKZBt5evC3q1W5cLTD2MHhA&oe=6559FAEA,https://www.facebook.com/100064642124158/posts/716410710523660,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/383951179_706766474821417_4177896583858855712_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fZIwlL_JMY8AX83fOYM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCUlvEoLfrtiTfdrbYu083NNR1GmUrxDmVVGZm8mkG2zw&oe=6559F929

Hij beloofde hen dat Frankrijk er alles aan zou doen ""om hun veilige terugkeer naar Frankrijk te garanderen"". Hij herinnerde hen aan zijn steun in de context van ""deze vreselijke beproeving en zijn vastberadenheid om meedogenloos te strijden tegen alle vormen van terrorisme"". Tijdens een discussie met jongeren toonde Macron zich uiterst bezorgd voor de import van terreurdaden in Frankrijk en voor een risico op ""verdeeldheid"" . Na de aanslag in Arras heerst inmiddels de noodtoestand in Frankrijk. Hij zei dat het conflict tussen Israël en Hamas een ""splijtzwam"" kan zijn in Frankrijk.""We zijn allemaal Fransen, we mogen dit conflict niet importeren"". Hij wees er ook op dat Frankrijk ""de grootste Joodse gemeenschap"" in Europa heeft. ""We hebben een enorm aantal jongeren uit het Midden-Oosten, Noord-Afrika en Afrika. We hebben ook veel jongeren met een moslimgeloof"". Op de vraag of hij naar Israël zou reizen, stelde Macron dat hij dat zou doen ""wanneer het zinvol is"".

facebook,"Tonight, President Biden is expected to announce billions of dollars in funding for Israel, after announcing millions of dollars in relief funding for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. When will the two parties that control this country learn? For nearly one hundred years, Israel and her neighbors have been at war. Hardly a day goes by that there is not some kind of violence, or conflict, in the Gaza Strip. And we fund both sides. Now we are paying to bomb and destroy and paying to build it back up. It’s time to stop funding war, and start funding peace. My heart aches for those killed in Israel. I have two daughters who regularly go to concerts, and I couldn’t bear to lose either of them in the way those in Israel have lost their loved ones. But we cannot make a problem better by doing what has made it worse over and over again. From Syria to Iraq to Libya to Afghanistan, the American record of choosing sides in a war is dismal– for civilians on either side, for our service members, and for our citizens here at home. Many of my fellow Libertarians would argue that we should spend nothing, and they may be right, as doing so may cause more harm than good. However, if we are to take taxpayer dollars from hard working Americans and send it to a foreign conflict it should be directed towards peace instead of war. Funding one or both sides of a conflict directly is pouring fuel on an already raging fire. Our billions, and our military might, should be used to support peace either directly, as we did with the Camp David Accords, or through a neutral country like Switzerland, who has remained neutral in two world wars. Our billions should be a bounty for peace instead of bombs. I am on the side of less wars. I am on the side of less death. And I believe funding warring governments has never led to either.",,117,"{'like_count': 70, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 42447}",Lars for President,,2023-10-20 00:09:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/371037883_628974226040834_6579465448633157005_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=F3F7HjSTxO8AX9sPU43&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBzD1hn57pSudcacAaQM2_IPSZTO91FUkfu7MiTfI_UPg&oe=655B4589,https://www.facebook.com/100067847866675/posts/655550600049863,

instagram,"A message to my non-Arab friends, 

I hope you know that everything we’re posting is for you. I am not posting for my Arab friends. This is not news to us. We grew up with this conversation in our homes. We grew up with the pain of our Palestinian friends who could not seem to get in or out of their own country. We grew up with the constant dehumanization of Arabs and vilification of Muslims. This is not news to us. 

When Palestinians are taking time to make videos in English while the world around them falls apart, I hope you realize that it’s for YOU. When we constantly share videos of the genocide, it’s so that YOU can start seeing Palestinians as more than just numbers on a news report. When we share videos of our protests, we’re trying to get the reality across to YOU. 

This genocide is funded by your governments with your own tax payer dollars. It is perpetuated by the propaganda that you are consuming. Your countries are what control the media that is silencing the Palestinian people. The plethora of information being posted is for you, it’s us trying to share with you the reality we’ve known for years. 

This is not a conflict and this is not a war. This is a genocide. Don’t be complicit. Don’t blindly stand on the wrong side of history.

instagram,"I’ve found it hard to express the collective trauma, depression, rage, grief and helplessness that myself and so many Sudanese people wrestle with on the daily since April 15, 2023. 

I find it hard just BEING of the diaspora, because I’m privileged enough to be spared the most horrid realities of the conflict that’s engulfed my motherland, while so many suffer an unjust fate. 

I find it hard to look at these pictures, they remind me of a lifetime’s worth of stories and lessons my parents,  as well as the local community, imparted on me. Stories of our traditions, our heritage, our lineage, and our pride lays here in the lands of our forefathers. The sacrifices our elders made to give us a chance at a better life, the selfless  acts my parents undertook to insure I would always know where I’m from and the lands to which I must return. To understand that we’ve been granted a more bountiful life but all those roads lead home. To aid, to uplift, to use what powers Allah has granted us for the betterment of our people. 

Today,  I feel like I’ve failed. This same house whose roof we stand upon is no longer ours. It was stormed by rebel militia and taken over, with our family expelled from the premises. The home my father grew up in lays in rubble after an army air strike. 

I find it heartbreaking  to see my parents and our elders in this way. Lost, disconnected, depressed. The country they’ve served a lifetime uplifting is now one which they cannot even return to. These homes that have bound us to the land for generations have been uprooted and decimated all in the name of war criminals vying for power, funded and supported by various foreign nations with their own interests. 

Fuck the politics of it all, I find it hard just to pickup the phone and hear the next horror story. With many of my friends and family amongst the 7 million displaced, and close to 10,000 dead, with no end in sight.

instagram,"Israel is finalising the closure of Al Jazeera over its coverage of the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which it says is helping Hamas.

The Qatar-based network is the biggest Arabic language news outlet providing televised and online updates on the situation in Gaza, within Israel and in other occupied Palestinian territories.

On Friday, a number of Israeli media outlets, including i24 News and Times of Israel, said that the Israeli government had approved “emergency regulations” that would shutter broadcasters that are deemed to be acting against the “security of the state”.

The Times of Israel quoted Israeli Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi who said Israel was at war on “land, in the air, at sea, and on the public diplomacy front”.

Before the ban on the network is enacted, it will need approval from Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who is expected to sign the regulation.

Although floated as temporary, the ban can be renewed at 30-day intervals.

The move against Al Jazeera comes amid a wider crackdown on opposing views within Israel.

Karhi has also proposed targeting any journalist, including Israelis, who are deemed to be “harming national morale”.

Journalists and other citizens could have their homes searched, property seized and could be placed under arrest for speech the government deems undesirable.

On the international front, Israeli public diplomacy accounts have condemned media outlets for getting their news from “terrorist organisations”.

Al Jazeera has a vast operation within Gaza, which will likely continue to broadcast out of the besieged territory.

The network has a frosty relationship with Israel despite being one of the first in the region to interview Israeli figures on-air.

In 2022, Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot dead by an Israeli soldier while reporting in Jenin.

The network most recently condemned Israel for a missile attack on a group of journalists in Lebanon, which included its own reporters.",,19806,"{'like_count': 19075, 'comment_count': 731, 'num_users': 1157344}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-20 13:37:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15258686_1293569957329919_8094586152507408384_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CJDb2hU5us0AX_v4NHq&_nc_oc=AQmhTNx9JSMKJ7ByPW-gAGlyTUGiK1GB9OxZLYVv7ZLpS0ddjuukWkjI1QowiM0WwAw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDM7VWUIVa31bFMO0RjUyWcPwhVRpDGdNt6sYzg3bsFBw&oe=655A8754,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyn2B3DIZDD/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393584484_1032979924607650_6555893118122335391_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=WA2YoD8UelUAX8z_Jrx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAYfc8PfaAr6S6glKW0ZTnXrX_4qW92BZ8tN_2jtDs9Bw&oe=654D345E
instagram,"The dark truth about Neo Palestinian nationalism 

Let’s talk about the birth of the 
Neo Palestinians and their Nazi past 🎤 

Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a key figure in Palestinian Arab nationalism during the 20th century, sparked controversy with his association with Adolf Hitler during World War II. 🌟

🕌 Serving as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, he held influential positions in the local Arab community. Before the RE establishment of israel, he turned to Nazi Germany for support in furthering his nationalist objectives.

🤝 His friendship with Hitler is a topic of historical debate. He visited Nazi Germany, meeting high-ranking officials, including Hitler himself. His aim was to gain German assistance in opposing British and Jewish interests in the Middle East. While not formally a known as a Nazi, he sympathized with their anti-Semitic views and shared their opposition to Jewish immigration to the British mandate of Palestine.

Part of his Nazi Collaboration was Preaching translated Nazi Antisemitism Ideology into Arabic and Radio Broadcasting Incitement to Violence Against Jews and Recruiting Muslim men to Service the Nazi Military to the Entire Arab Speaking world. 

He was responsible for successfully teaching the Arab world to adopt their own brand of Nazi Antisemitism : Labelled AntiZionism 

🗣️ This association has drawn widespread criticism and continues to be a contentious subject in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Some view Al-Husseini as a collaborator with Nazi ideology, while others stress his pursuit of Palestinian nationalist goals. Nevertheless, his connection with Hitler remains a significant aspect of their dark past

instagram,"World News:
Two American hostages - a mother and her daughter - were released from Gaza by the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing.

The group's spokesman, Abu Ubaida, announced the release of the US citizens on Friday, stating it was done ""for humanitarian reasons, and to prove to the American people and the world that the claims made by Biden and his fascist administration are false and baseless."" Ubaida noted that Qatar made this release possible. 

In a statement, an IDF Spokesman said, ""Hamas presents itself to the world at this hour as one who releases hostages for humanitarian reasons, but in reality, we are talking about a murderous terror group, which at this hour is holding babies, children, women, and elderly captive.""

According to Israeli officials, the two Americans released by Hamas are 59-year-old Judith Ra'anan and her 18-year-old daughter, Nathalie. They both are from the suburbs of Chicago and were abducted by Hamas while visiting their grandmother in the town of Nahal Oz near the Gaza Strip. 

According to Israeli officials, the attack on Nahal Oz resulted in 130 out of the 471 Israeli civilians living in the city being shot or taken hostage. 

This development comes as the death toll from the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues to rise. According to Israeli officials, 1,400 people, including civilians and foreigners, died after Hamas launched attacks on October 7. Officials in Gaza have reported that over 4,000 people have died due to Israeli airstrikes, a significant number of them being women and children.",,19043,"{'like_count': 17707, 'comment_count': 1336, 'num_users': 966663}","Real News, Not Bullshit",,2023-10-20 20:42:22,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/210871732_2297447983890016_8350712253230690398_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nBbjySDBVlQAX87JSho&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBk14T-MaDPBNwPwWX3loRBZR46eror1wY2VFxIvbBxVg&oe=6559C8F0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyomocwPS8l/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394085964_1378851053054921_2503356245837000106_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=FaDpsMEEP4cAX9Qj1Fq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfApzETTS8cCkQMFz7fApUsMJM87KjalStqqa3yDqRV8pA&oe=65486BD6

instagram,"London’s Metropolitan Police on Friday said they will not be arresting anyone chanting a popular slogan used by Palestinian activists during demonstrations.

The slogan in question, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, is commonly heard at solidarity marches and refers to the area of historic Palestine between the River Tiberias and the Mediterranean Sea.

Pro-Israel groups claim it is antisemitic because it is an implicit call for the destruction of Israel, a charge rejected by Palestinian activists.

The police force’s guidance comes ahead of what are expected to be large demonstrations in support of Palestinians on Saturday.

Passions have been running high in the UK as the conflict in Gaza rages on. Palestinian activists have previously expressed concerns about the criminalisation of political expression and free speech when it comes to criticising Israel.

Earlier in October, British Home Secretary Suella Braverman advised police forces across the country to look into the possibility of whether the waving of Palestinian flags amounted to a criminal offence.

“Behaviours that are legitimate in some circumstances, for example, the waving of a Palestinian flag, may not be legitimate such as when intended to glorify acts of terrorism,” she wrote in a letter to police chiefs.

As things stand, under British law, expressions of support for proscribed groups, such as Hamas or Hezbollah, can lead to arrest with the possibility of fines and prison sentences for those convicted of an offence.

The civil rights group Liberty has condemned what it calls the government’s attack on “the ability to stand up for what we believe in is our fundamental right”.

“Recent government responses to protests relating to Israel and Palestine are an attack on that right, and an attempt to erode the way we can make our voices heard,” the group said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter.",,13461,"{'like_count': 13318, 'comment_count': 143, 'num_users': 1157344}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-20 21:55:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15258686_1293569957329919_8094586152507408384_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CJDb2hU5us0AX_v4NHq&_nc_oc=AQmhTNx9JSMKJ7ByPW-gAGlyTUGiK1GB9OxZLYVv7ZLpS0ddjuukWkjI1QowiM0WwAw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDM7VWUIVa31bFMO0RjUyWcPwhVRpDGdNt6sYzg3bsFBw&oe=655A8754,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyou_zVIPyN/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393545352_384712227310654_4226584844075551520_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=RzQPewtU9YcAX-1yEpa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAUqp_6N2eQuXfcVp8wFN4shKIcK17HWwZPhjvvcdkxWg&oe=65397641
instagram,"🚨 𝐁𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐊𝐈𝐍𝐆: Bayern statement on Noussair Mazraoui and his pro Palestine post…

FC Bayern München had a detailed and clarifying conversation with Noussair Mazraoui this week. The reason for the debate was Mazraoui's Instagram posts in connection with the terror against Israel almost two weeks ago, which led to irritation and criticism. 

 “Noussair Mazraoui has credibly assured us that, as a peace-loving person, he resolutely rejects terror and war. He regrets if his posts have caused irritation,” says Jan-Christian Dreesen, CEO of FC Bayern, and explains: “FC Bayern condemns Hamas’ attack on Israel.” - “In addition,” explains Noussair Mazraoui, “I condemn every kind of terrorism and every terrorist organization.” 

FC Bayern and Noussair Mazraoui resolutely oppose the transfer of the Middle East conflict and its violence to Germany, which is committed to peace. Hatred and violence of any kind have no place in Germany's political culture. 

FC Bayern stands on the side of the Jewish community in Germany and on the side of Israel; nothing justifies the murder of children and families.   

FC Bayern is convinced that football should develop its power of balancing between different cultures, especially in the most difficult moments. Noussair Mazraoui will remain in the FC Bayern squad, but is currently out due to an injury he sustained during an international match with the Moroccan national team.",,12465,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 2465, 'num_users': 1975861}",𝐋𝐈𝐕𝐄 HERE WE GO 🚨,,2023-10-20 09:33:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/365925662_601738975410369_3552070512077960770_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ISuSj2dMq_gAX8BbQv3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD8rXVxk-Y1Sq3Ng5bZzPifXGcRLZbNTQeIhEp14cFDVQ&oe=655A8D1E,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynaCnasA9a/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393719222_646866040848458_6130840247903317948_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SAlquKdiucgAX_XDp_D&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBxQK8f2cQyJNUqFbOzZ0zENIPlzloxjJLasd-1MVE65g&oe=6537A47C
instagram,"(warning: distressing) 

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of Congress' few Muslim members, shared with NBC News a tranche of death threats she says she's received amid the Israel-Gaza war. 

While Omar strongly denounced the Hamas attack that sparked the current conflict, her ongoing criticism of the U.S.'s involvement with Israel has made her subject to Islamophobia and targeted threats, with individuals falsely equating her concern about Palestinians with support for Hamas, NBC News reported on Oct 20.

One of the threatening voicemails shared with NBC News called Omar a ‘terrorist Muslim.’ Another message alleged that she and her children were being surveilled by a vigilante group that had shared their addresses with rapists. The message also claimed the group had hacked into Omar’s accounts and were planning to poison her family. In a third voicemail, an alleged member of a militant group said, ‘I can’t wait ‘til our group sees you one day and I can rip your f*cking rag off your head... I hope the Israelis kill every f*cking one of you.’

Setting the stage for these threats was the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump. He often targeted Omar and other 'Squad' members, including Palestinian American Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), by urging them to 'go back' to the countries 'from which they came.' Other Republican representatives, such as Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, have labeled them the 'Jihad Squad,' while Marjorie Taylor Greene referred to them as the 'Hamas caucus.'

In a statement, Omar said, ‘It directly endangered my life and that of my family, as well as subjected my staff to traumatic verbal abuse simply for doing their jobs. More importantly, it threatens the millions of American Muslims. This toxic language and imagery has real-world consequences. House Republican leaders stay silent as their party unleashes these toxic attacks and refuse to hold extremists in their ranks accountable. Since assuming office, two men have pleaded guilty to threatening to kill me. This is very real. I fear for my children and have to speak to them about remaining vigilant because you just never know.’

instagram,"A 50-year-old Indian-origin doctor working at a hospital in Bahrain was arrested on Thursday, October 19, for anti-Palestine posts on social media.

Dr Sunil J Rao, a specialist in internal medicine at Royal Bahrain Hospital, was terminated immediately before his arrest.

In a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, Rao supported Israel amid its conflict with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

“IsraelFightsBack will do a scorched earth attack, plenty will be killed, displaced, Hamas will be destroyed (rightly so), then what? If I may ask? #Israel #Gaza #IsraelPalestineConflict. Occupy under military force? one of the posts reads.

Rao was arrested by the Anti-Cyber Crimes Directorate of the General Directorate of Anti-Corruption and Economic and Electronic Security for violations of civil peace and social stability that could affect society’s security and safety.

In a statement, Royal Bahrain Hospital said, “It has come to our attention that Dr Sunil Rao who is working as a Specialist in Internal Medicine has posted tweets on social media that are offensive to our society.”

It added, “We would like to confirm that his tweets and ideology are personal and do not reflect the opinion and values of the hospital.”

“This is a violation of our code of conduct and we have taken the necessary legal actions and his service has been terminated with immediate effect.”

Before the hospital’s response, Rao took to X and wrote, “I profoundly regret my words & actions.”

He added, “I would like to apologized about the statement that I posted on this platform. It was insensitive in the context of the current event. As a doctor all lives matter. I respect this country its people and its religion deeply as I have been here for past 10 years.”

Dr Sunil J Rao, who hails from the Indian state of Karnataka, is a graduate of Andhra Medical College in Visakhapatnam, India and completed his MD from Kasturba Medical College in Mangaluru, Karnataka.

instagram,"The population of the Gaza Strip is 2.2 million.

The narrow slice of land covering 140 square miles — roughly the size of Las Vegas — is one of the most densely populated places on earth.

Two-thirds of the Palestinians living in Gaza are refugees or their descendants from the 1948 war, and most of the population is Muslim. There is also a small native Palestinian Christian population.

Since 2007, Gaza has been under a strict land and sea blockade by Israel that prevents civilians, along with goods like food and medicine, from easily moving across the border, contributing to harsh economic conditions and high poverty levels.

Culturally, education has remained a top priority. More than 95% of children aged 6-12 in Gaza attend school, and most graduate from high school. Additionally, 57% of students at the Islamic University of Gaza are female.

The drive for attaining education is part cultural, part pride, and it all goes back to the 1948 displacement, says Maha Nassar, an associate professor in the School of Middle Eastern and North African Studies at the University of Arizona.

Many Palestinians simply don't get the chance to grow old — dying in their early adulthood either in conflicts or due to a struggling healthcare system — which drags the averages down.

The 16-year blockade has hampered fast access to medical care and caused shortages of essential supplies like gauze and I.V. bags, says Yara Asi — an assistant professor of global health management and informatics at the University of Central Florida, and the author of the upcoming book, How War Kills.

""They're constantly dealing with short-term health issues, and those that need chronic care either don't get it or have to leave.""

“My definition of love has evolved over the years. Earlier, it used to be about passion and excitement. Now, it’s more about understanding, support, and a deep emotional connection,” she adds, “I do believe in soulmates, but I’m not sure about love at first sight. I think it’s possible to have a strong connection with someone right away, but true love often develops and deepens over time.”

instagram,"Hell on Earth, 1968

The Vietnam War changed the traditional American attitudes to war, as war became more televised and the average citizen witnessed the true horrors and challenging circumstances of a conflict zone. Soldiers became more vocal in their opinions on war and the army. Designing their lighters was one of these ways of self-expression. 

Lighters were popular as army food rations had a daily pack of cigarettes (usually four cigarettes per pack). Marijuana also grew in the wild in Vietnam. Many US troops (over 50 per cent) smoked Marijuana at least once to deal with the stress, trauma, and pain of fighting a jungle war they were unprepared for.

Lighters symbolised temporary peace, addiction, and the psychological traumas that the Vietnam War caused many soldiers.

The voting age during this time in America was 21, while the age to enlist (or get drafted) was 18. In 1971, President Nixon passed the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18. 

These lighters show the attitudes that many of the US soldiers had towards politics, serving in Vietnam, and their opinions on killing and death, and what it took to be a man, thousands of miles away from home, in the green inferno that was the Vietnam War.

instagram,"Nearly two weeks after the deadliest conflict between Israel and Palestine in recent memory broke out, killing thousands of civilians on both sides, Indian PM Modi spoke to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and assured him that New Delhi will continue to send humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people.

PM Modi also conveyed his condolences over the deaths of around 500 civilians in an explosion at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Palestinian authorities blamed Israeli air strikes for the explosion at the hospital, while Israel said it was caused by a misfired rocket launched from Gaza by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

PM also shared with Abbas India's ""deep concern"" over terrorism, violence, and the deteriorating security situation in the region.

""Spoke to the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Conveyed my condolences at the loss of civilian lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza,"" Modi said on X.

""We will continue to send humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people. Shared our deep concern at the terrorism, violence and deteriorating security situation in the region,"" he said. ""Reiterated India's long-standing principled position on the Israel-Palestine issue,"" the prime minister added.

Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that in the telephonic conversation with Abbas, PM Modi reaffirmed India's unwavering support for peace based on international law and expressed his solidarity with the Palestinian people during these trying times.

He emphasised the importance of returning to negotiations and dialogues to achieve a lasting peace in the region, it said. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi has said that India's position concerning the Palestine issue has been ""longstanding and consistent"".

""India has always advocated the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent & viable state of Palestine living within secure and recognised borders side by side at peace with Israel. That position remains the same,"" he said.

According to the MEA, India's support for the Palestinian cause is integral to the nation's foreign policy.",,6794,"{'like_count': 6709, 'comment_count': 85, 'num_users': 783490}",Indiatimes,,2023-10-20 05:52:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/370572795_289657980337985_3572264800135278624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=L3zIpLG0fIYAX9vxNfY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAFMA5_YaL8ry2cr4nUwUFbJ7y6wn8sLSjnNDA_oBUPiA&oe=655ADEE1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynA0NuISxe/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/393978065_660791029491827_5798543238099396828_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=W8UfBWUMnkUAX8oc3mZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAoxu2qKJSbu3QFJDdoMfwjB0RUMjayCS2lKV7SomhqqA&oe=653B876C

The Edans were killed during the deadly infiltration by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip while two of their children hid in a closet. Roy Edan, who was a photojournalist, documented the infiltration before he was shot. Their 3-year-old daughter, Abigail, remains unaccounted for. 
 
Israel has vowed to wipe out the Hamas Islamist group that rules Gaza, after its gunmen burst through the barrier fence surrounding the enclave on Oct. 7 and rampaged through Israeli towns and kibbutzes, killing 1,400 people, mainly civilians.
 
At least 4,137 Palestinians have been killed and 13,000 wounded in Gaza in Israeli strikes since Oct. 7, the Palestinian health ministry said.

instagram,"So many people are looking for ‘peace' in others while neglecting to live peaceful lives to foster peaceful relationships 🤔

There are many problems with this, first things first: this tendency to rely on others for “inner peace”

This idea that peace can be found in another person leads to codependency. You should not be emotionally reliant on someone to be your “peace” in order for you to be happy, this will inevitably strain the relationship and create more conflict (the same conflict that you’re trying to avoid)

Many desire peace until they're asked to take responsibility for their actions that cause chaos

At times, someone may avoid a relationship with you because you hold them accountable and express your feelings, which they interpret as 'stress.' 

They then seek someone new who is ‘stress-free' to evade introspection. This behavior results in a pattern of shallow connections, as they prioritize avoiding conflict over building genuine intimacy.

They often enjoy the initial infatuation stage with someone new but shy away from the deeper, more intimate aspects of a relationship. This infatuation can be thrilling, but sustaining a meaningful connection requires going beyond surface-level attraction and doing some of the hard work

True intimacy is built on trust, vulnerability, and open communication, and it's only in these deeper layers of a relationship that lasting peace and fulfillment can be found.

If you’re tired of finding yourself in relationships like this and you're ready to break free from these patterns and discover the path to deeper, more fulfilling relationships, I have three slots open for 1:1 coaching. Click the link in bio to apply or DM “I’m ready” so I can support you ❤️

“I had a dream that the president of the EU Council, the Parliament and the Commission would all be standing holding Palestinian flags on Wednesday morning, and holding a minute of silence in solidarity with the Palestinians massacred at the hospital, and over the past decades,” he told Al Jazeera. “But I was very disturbed when I woke up, realising it was just a dream. And it will only remain a dream.”⁠

He called on #EU leaders to show solidarity with the Palestinians who were killed in the conflict and condemned the bombing of al-Ahli Arab Hospital.⁠

instagram,"Meta has apologised after for adding “terrorist” into the profile bios of some Instagram users describing themselves as Palestinian.  In a blog post, Meta said it fixed a “problem” faced by some Instagram users, with the word “Palestinian” written in English on their profile, the Palestinian flag emoji and the word “alhamdulillah” written in Arabic.  When auto-translated to English the phrase read: “Praise be to god, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom.” A TikTok user posted about the issue, noting that different combinations still translated to “terrorist”. @khanman1996 said in his posts he was not Palestinian himself but had tested the error out after being told about it by an unnamed Palestinian friend.

instagram,"There are many collective shadows that we are being asked to illuminate and transmute at the moment. 

And this is one of them.

This is most likely one of the hardest the look at and Illuminate.

Over the last few days I sat with all the ways I have done that.

I've explored the ways I have done things that deep down I knew would hurt someone else, yet I still did it.

Underneath, there was often helplessness, powerlessness, deep hurt, fear and despair that I was running away from.

I've had to look at my own capacity for evil. And this is something I work on keeping in check regularly, especially in heightened times.

There is an energetic bigger game that is at play.

In order to anchor peace on the planet, we need to look at and integrate the consciousness that would be responsible for total destruction. We are asked to do that right now.

If you think of evil as a spirit that gives us the false impression that we have power over someone else's life... That is what I am talking about. 

Artificial power, that is disconnected from our true source of power. Our inner divinity.

We get to transcend that consciousness and all the ways we rationalize using that.

This consciousness is at the core of the conflict we are witnessing in the middle east at the moment, if not all wars.

It uses our pain and despair to hijack our capacity for discernment, wisdom and love.

My prayer is that we get to a place where honoring other people's sovereignty as much as we honor our own becomes common sense. That's the space where peace exists.

instagram,"The recent conflict in Israel and Palestine is, for me, a stark reminder of the fragility of peaceful social and religious relationships, and how we should strive to keep politics separate from these as much as possible. I do not take the socioreligious harmony we have here for granted, so when I can, I try to do my very small part by participating in various religious festivals and celebrations.

So I was honored last week to attend Zhun Ti Tang’s Nine Emperor Gods’ Ceremony, held at #Rivervale, in lieu of my colleague @chuakhengwee (who was traveling). The proceedings lasted a good few hours, during which I learned about the origins of the various practices, including the lighting of nine lamps (one for each deity), the invitation to visit from the water, and the prop that accompanies the sedan procession.

I am neither Taoist nor Buddhist, the two groups that (in Singapore) celebrate the festival. Nevertheless, I believe that the respect we confer on others’ exercise of their faith—especially when they take the effort to invite you to partake in something so special to them—is more important than the need to strictly adhere to one’s own religious norms. It is for this reason that, when I visit a wake, I am willing to light incense; I believe, after all, that I am honoring those not only those that have passed, but also those who remain and are in mourning.

My thanks to the organizers for the invitation, and I wish them and all devotees a meaningful period of prayer and reflection for the remainder of the festival.",,4416,"{'like_count': 4256, 'comment_count': 160, 'num_users': 114427}",Jamus Lim,,2023-10-20 00:16:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/105938629_193747838688815_5910566610092748338_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=hhzXgqjBK6sAX81X0AA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBGu3qJjSyL5dlmJpoa1fVhF6LWC-QMHFKCez88qGb5zw&oe=655A41D3,https://www.instagram.com/p/CymaV5jvoAU/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393576014_3566394913616540_7534313973429657482_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=e3OllEmIfosAX9IsWYG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAEhXwoumEE3A3V0ayZSBkqX2D6Q1y1pWNUak_kMhlL3g&oe=655A6950

instagram,"It’s increasing difficult to find words in this cesspool of misinformation and hate to capture the sustained horror of this week, but I will try to my best to bear witness to:

Forensic evidence and first hand accounts proving more than 80% of the 1400 civilians massacred in Israel were tortured to death in ways we have not seen since the Holocaust -children and parents slowly tortured and killed before each others eyes. We are the only people who have to give the international community a tour of our morgues; 

Statements shared and published by those who were silent after October 7th, but are now compelled to speak out since it’s not Jewish life and children that have to be centered. This sudden compassion for humanity has also led to overnight meme-based PhDs on the Israel/Palestine conflict . To be clear, folks who outright justify torture as resistance are not even worth crying over- the history books will come for them;

Non-Jews continuing to share fringe Jewish voices of token organizations who justify their own people’s murders for followers and “good Jew” gold stars;

Genocidal professors at our country’s most prestigious universities segregating Jews in their classrooms and relishing in the success of their bloodthirsty freedom fighters…their impressionable students following their lead. 

The hate-filled murder of 6 year old Wadea Al Fayoum that brought me to my knees. 

The unfolding of the one of the greatest blood libels in recent memory following Islamic Jihad’s bombing of Al-Ahli hospital; 

Demands for a ceasefire that do not include the release of more than 200 hostages or freeing the the people of Gaza from Hamas. 

There is just too much to grieve. 

On this Friday October 20th, 2023 —day 14 since our world changed forever, the Jews are tired. We are worn down by layer upon layer of enduring antisemitism that is as deep and inter-generational as our trauma. 

May peace come speedily in our days. May our hostages be freed, Hamas be dismantled and a ceasefire ensue. May all peace loving parents in Israel and Gaza be able to kiss their children at night.

instagram,"Breaking up from a long-term relationship and then returning to it has probably been my most requested experience to write about. And I have! A lot. But I’ve sat on everything since because it has all felt too present to examine in public. ‘Write about scars, not the wound’ the saying goes, and so despite writing being the best kind of catharsis for me and against the will of my internal voice which was desperate to share and connect, I lent into instinct and decided to wait.

I think you naturally start craving more privacy as you grow older. I certainly feel more protective over my sense of self and my relationship than I used to. I knew if I was going to write about the experience, I didn’t want it to be about the mechanics of what happened à la reality TV, but rather what it was like for me to not be someone’s partner for the first time in my adult life. 

I’d never lived by myself, never since my teenage years not had to consider compromising for the sake of harmony. But while I was slipping into new confidences to see how they fit, I was also trying to navigate how to make better a relationship which still, in so many ways, lit up my life. That confusion and conflict riding alongside an adolescent independence which mostly manifested in food, food, eating and food: that’s what I wanted to write about.

So that’s the part I’ve decided to share. I talk about indulging in dinners and staying up late like a teenager, luxuriating in the novelty of not sharing a routine and home with anyone. I talk about feeling disappointed with myself, peering round the corners of the ghost lives I didn’t live and wondering ‘what if?’. I talk about the feared judgement of reconciling, of wondering whether everyone will think I’m a coward. And of course I speak about love, big fat fully hearty stubborn love, and the crucial decision of actively deciding to be together rather than it being a default.

Hand on heart, that 6 month period last spring was my necessary cocoon moment; I needed to quit avoiding and face the truth of myself, and I came out of it feeling both happier in my identity and happier in my relationship.

The epic conclusion to the intensely romantic and beautifully written story that started in Divine Rivals.

Two weeks have passed since Iris Winnow returned home bruised and heartbroken from the front, but the war is far from over. Roman is missing, and the city of Oath continues to dwell in a state of disbelief and ignorance. When Iris and Attie are given another chance to report on Dacre’s movements, they both take the opportunity and head westward once more despite the danger, knowing it’s only a matter of time before the conflict reaches a city that’s unprepared and fracturing beneath the chancellor’s reign.

Since waking below in Dacre’s realm, Roman cannot remember his past. But given the reassurance that his memories will return in time, Roman begins to write articles for Dacre, uncertain of his place in the greater scheme of the war. When a strange letter arrives by wardrobe door, Roman is first suspicious, then intrigued. As he strikes up a correspondence with his mysterious pen pal, Roman will soon have to make a decision: to stand with Dacre or betray the god who healed him. And as the days grow darker, inevitably drawing Roman and Iris closer together…the two of them will risk their very hearts and futures to change the tides of the war.

One of the officials said the missiles were fired by Iranian-backed Houthi militants, who are engaged in an ongoing conflict in Yemen. 

Approximately 2-3 missiles were intercepted, according to the second official.

The officials said it was unclear what the missiles were targeting. It’s possible the missiles were fired at the USS Carney or launched towards another target.

The incident comes amid high concern about potential Iranian aggression as tensions in the Middle East continue to rise following the Hamas terror attack in Israel. Iran has long been a backer of Hamas.

The USS Carney transited through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea on Wednesday. US Fleet Forces command said in a social media post that it would “help ensure maritime security and stability in the Middle East.”

instagram,"🚨STATEMENT OF FC BAYERN MUNICH REGARDING NOUSSAIR MAZRAOUI

FC Bayern Munich held a detailed and clarifying conversation with Noussair Mazraoui this week. The reason for the discussion was Mazraoui's Instagram posts in connection with the terror against Israel almost two weeks ago, which led to irritation and criticism.

""Noussair Mazraoui has credibly assured us that as a peace-loving person he resolutely rejects terror and war and he never meant to cause any irritation with his posts"", said Jan-Christian Dreesen, CEO of FC Bayern explaining, ""FC Bayern condemns Hamas' attack on Israel"" - ""Furthermore, Noussair Mazraoui declares, ""I condemn all terrorism and terrorist organizations.""

FC Bayern and Noussair Mazraoui strongly oppose the transfer of the Middle East conflict and its violence to Germany, which is committed to peace. Hate and violence of any kind have no place in the political culture of Germany.

FC Bayern stands by Germany's Jewish community and by Israel's side; nothing justifies the murder of children and families.

FC Bayern believes that football should unleash its power of reconciliation between different cultures, especially in the most difficult moments. Noussair Mazraoui will remain in the FC Bayern squad, but is out of action due to an injury he sustained.

Amid ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi, with other nobel laureates has appealed for compassion for all children in the war reminding the world that all the children in Israel and Gaza are “our children” and need protection and immediate humanitarian aid.

In a joint statement, in a rare initiative, 29 Nobel Laureates joined Indian Nobel Laureate Satyarthi in signing a statement today reminding the world that all the children in Israel and Gaza are “our children” and need protection and immediate humanitarian aid.

The Nobel Laureates from all the six Nobel fields called for urgent release of the kidnapped children and a safe passage for all the children away from the conflict.

The statement jointly said that all children and vulnerable persons must receive humanitarian aid immediately, and ""compassion should not be reserved for only one group of children in the war-torn zone"" as shown by many protests and leaders.

Now I feel like a child in the corner, paralyzed, pleading, please stop hurting each other. Here are some words from @artforum and a group of artists about the immediately unfolding humanitarian crisis. Sharing this is not intended to support Hamas, nor to ignore the awful atrocities that Israel has faced. It is a response from a world who is afraid they are witnessing a genocide in real time. It is not a complete statement, and does not begin to speak to the level of grief and loss that every person affected by this conflict is facing. More is needed, more empathy, more willingness to see the heartbreaking complexity, but it is a start. The letter is closed but they list more ways to help through its link. “Cultural leaders including Nan Goldin, Judith Butler, Laura Poitras, Barbara Kruger, Kara Walker, Saidiya Hartman, and Emily Jacir have signed an open letter calling for an immediate ceasefire and the opening of Gaza’s crossings to allow humanitarian aid to enter unhindered.

From the open letter:
“We support Palestinian liberation and call for an end to the killing and harming of all civilians, an immediate ceasefire, the passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the end of the complicity of our governing bodies in grave human rights violations and war crimes.”

“We, the undersigned, reject violence against all civilians, regardless of their identity, and we call for ending the root cause of violence: oppression, and the occupation.”

“We call on you to refuse inhumanity, which has no place in life or art, and make a public demand from our governments to call for a ceasefire.”

instagram,"For one day, just one day, ask yourself this question before everything you do:

👉 Is it easy?

If the answer is “yes,” it’s the wrong project, activity, path, etc. 

Here are few examples:

- Watching TV is easy; reading a book hard.
- Coming home from work and plopping on the couch is easy; going to gym or even a 45 minute walk is hard.
- Staying quiet during your work meeting when you know the answer is easy; speaking up and owning the solution to the problem is hard.

If you want to grow as a leader, salesperson, parent, lover, etc. “easy” should be a negative filter. 

Nothing worth doing is easy, not over the long term…

- Purpose. 
- Happiness. 
- Satisfaction. 
- Meaning. 
- Connection.

These are the result of struggle and the associated conflict and pain which accompany it.

All I’m asking is that you choose hard for one day.

Shit… make ONE hard choose today.

Make one hard choice in which you normally would have picked the easy option.

Then HIT REPLY and tell me about it.

I will happily share that victory with you! 

Easy is for the ordinary.

This is the way.

instagram,"Joe Biden, the Lying, Flying Carpet
New #bengarrison cartoon

#JoeBiden’s trip to #Israel has been lauded by the left, but to me it was nothing more than a publicity stunt designed to prop up his failing campaign for a second term.

During his visit, he displayed his usual confusion and befuddled babbling. He got snubbed by Arab leaders while he insulted Israel by saying #Hamas needed to become ‘better shots.’ He also called them a ‘team,’ as if the conflict were a sporting event. Then, for some reason, Biden said he was born in Israel.

instagram,"A Coral Gables dentist was fired after a viral video showed him tearing down posters of kidnapped Israelis. Now, he's telling his side of the story. Dr. Ahmed ElKoussa and another man were caught on camera taking down the flyers in Brickell on Tuesday night, and the video was quickly posted all over social media.
By Wednesday morning, ElKoussa had been fired by his employer, CG Smile. On Thursday, ElKoussa spoke to reporters alongside his attorney Hassan Shibly to explain that he feels the video was widely misinterpreted. 

""Unfortunately my video of four seconds got taken way out of context as well as the way that my former employer had portrayed it, that it's an act of supporting terrorism,"" ElKoussa told reporters Thursday. ""It's the very very very contrary, it's to promote peace, it's to deescalate the situation that we're going through and make sure that our communities are safe.""

The fliers are part of a nationwide project by Israeli artists that show photos of missing civilians in Israel who have been kidnapped by the Hamas terrorist group after the attack on Israel nearly two weeks ago. The fliers are also posted to trees and other utility poles throughout South Florida. ElKoussa's attorney told NBC6 that the dentist was afraid the posters would spark conflict and talked to police before taking them down.

ElKoussa has received hateful messages and death threats since the video went viral, his attorney said. Shibly said ElKoussa didn't mean to offend anyone and that he stands for peace and unity. He said the website that posted the video incorrectly assumed ElKoussa's intentions. Shibly said he's demanding an apology and for ElKoussa to be reinstated.

It's a simple truth: no beef, just a recognition that not every connection aligns, and that's perfectly fine. Life's too short for unnecessary conflicts. Embrace the authenticity of your vibes, and let others do the same.✨

instagram,"Kushi is a romantic comedy film directed by Shiva Nirvana and follows the love story of Aradhya (played by Samantha Ruth Prabhu) and Viplav (played by Vijay Devarakonda). Despite Kushi’s very relevant premise, it doesn’t dwell on any conflict long enough to create any impact. It tries very hard to maintain a light and humorous tone with only a little bit of drama so it remains in the category of the so-called wholesome family entertainer.

With the war between the Cosmic King and those who opposed his reign continuing, legendary beings have spawned left and right to defend their sides. And while this is all occurring, many tend to forget the innocent. Countless casualties have already been reported for the fight of the galaxy, and still, it doesn't end. And with each loss, a whisper is being muttered, a wish for the galactic conflict to stop. And through these wishes, Cild was born. He is an anomaly, a creature made from people's hope. The oddity resembles that of a child, a happy one, accompanied by two mysterious hand-like beings. His powers are currently unknown, but reports of war zones suddenly being abandoned, and when the soldiers were asked why, they all felt an overwhelming warmth that stopped them from causing harm to anyone.

What can I add to that ! Just can't think....I do love having friends stay, and we do often. They will be happy with the new kingsize mattress because we have actually had a double on king frame for a year, not ideal ! 
TBH I struggle as to what to say or post these days. With so much conflict in the world. It all seems utterly  frivolous to be posting, but then losing oneself in beautiful imagery is needed maybe ? A bit !

instagram,"Middle East Airlines will be reducing its flights in half starting Sunday, after its insurance companies lowered the insurance coverage out of fear of the situation on the southern front.

Despite this, MEA Chairman of the Board of Directors Mohamad El-Hout told Al-Jadeed that “no security information indicates a potential strike on the airport or Lebanon,” and that all the information they have received suggests that “the escalation in the south will remain within the parameters of the conflict.”

Insurance companies have also begun refusing to cover sea freight operations headed for Lebanon due to the increased war-related risks, which may lead to a disruption in the supply of certain goods in the market, as suppliers fear bearing the shipping risks, potentially causing price increases for various products.

instagram,"With a lot of hurt in the world, most of us are trying to process this global grief. 

Combining the state of the world, the change of seasons and the holidays fast approaching, grief enters its way into our hearts and minds. 

Grief is unfortunately unavoidable in life. It is the natural response to loss. Often grief is associated with death, but we can grieve lots of losses: unemployment, ill health, relocating, end of relationships and war and conflict in the world.

Conventionally grief is focused on emotional responses but it can also impact us physically, cognitively, behaviorally, socially, culturally and spiritually.

We all grieve differently.
There is no right or wrong. 
There is no timeframe or finish line.
There is no set pattern or predictability. 
There is not a time when grief
is completed. 
We find ways to live inside the grief and in doing so, it finds its own place within us.

Due to their impact on the limbic system, essential oils can help facilitate release of these common emotions that result from grieving. They can help shift perspective and allow us to process our emotions in a healthy manner. We can also use past memory scent associations of our loved ones to comfort us during challenging times.

instagram,"A map of Israel after the Six-Day War in 1967.

After World War I, the British created the Mandate Of Palestine in an attempt to give Jews a ""national home"" in Palestine.

As more and more Jews arrived, the tensions between Israelis and Palestinians grew larger. Israeli and native Arab tensions exploded after Israeli independence, culminating in many Arab-Israeli wars. The final war in 1967 resulted in the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The dispute between Israel and Palestine still persists today, and is one of the most controversial issues in the world.

What is your opinion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

Sharing the pic, she wrote, ""I keep staring at the sleeping peaceful face of my baby girl wondering how I would ever protect her if she were born in #Gaza and praying that she never finds herself in any such situation and then wondering what blessing she is born with and what curse those Gazan children were born under who are being killed everyday under an imprisoned sky?!?

The unadulterated evil and moral depravity we are amidst is unfathomable! To bomb children in hospitals, relief shelters, churches with impunity and a license granted by major powers of the world signals what dark and unjust times we live in. Praying to any God that will listen, protect the children of Gaza from further pain and death; because the world will not protect them.""

(1) ""There have been over 115 attacks on healthcare in Palestine since the start of the conflict on October 7, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). At least 20 hospitals in Gaza City and North Gaza and one hospital in Rafah have received repeated evacuation orders from the Israeli military, and 77 attacks have been documented in the West Bank, 43 of these attacks have caused physical violence to health teams."" 
And 
(2) Yesterday a spokesperson for the US said Biden doesn't think it's appropriate for there to be an international investigation into who bombed the hospital.

....Also I know there's going to be some jabronies in my comments saying ""well they should have evacuated"" because people need to remind us every day that they are devoid of basic human decency and will never see god. So I've enclosed the statement from WHO for people who are dumb enough to think you can evacuate a hospital when all of the other medical facilities have been destroyed. Swipe left.

4100 civilian lives have been killed in besieged Gaza so far including 1524 children, 1000 women, 120 elders not including civilian casualties reported The Palestinian Ministry of Health today. They had names, dreams, families & friends. Over one million civilians are displaced from their homes. Hospitals, schools, @unrwa shelters, churches, mosques, homes, apartment buildings, roads, businesses, press reporters and entire neighborhoods are being targeted, no where is safe. Cut off from drinking water, electricity & food. 

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world’s most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On October 15th, 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

“As scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.”

instagram,"❗ Official Bayern statement on Noussair Mazraoui 

FC Bayern München had a detailed and clarifying conversation with Noussair Mazraoui this week. The reason for the debate was Mazraoui's Instagram posts in connection with the terror against Israel almost two weeks ago, which led to irritation and criticism. 

 “Noussair Mazraoui has credibly assured us that, as a peace-loving person, he resolutely rejects terror and war. He regrets if his posts have caused irritation,” says Jan-Christian Dreesen, CEO of FC Bayern, and explains: “FC Bayern condemns Hamas’ attack on Israel.” - “In addition,” explains Noussair Mazraoui, “I condemn every kind of terrorism and every terrorist organization.” 

FC Bayern and Noussair Mazraoui resolutely oppose the transfer of the Middle East conflict and its violence to Germany, which is committed to peace. Hatred and violence of any kind have no place in Germany's political culture. 

FC Bayern stands on the side of the Jewish community in Germany and on the side of Israel; nothing justifies the murder of children and families.   

FC Bayern is convinced that football should develop its power of balancing between different cultures, especially in the most difficult moments. Noussair Mazraoui will remain in the FC Bayern squad, but is currently out due to an injury he sustained during an international match with the Moroccan national team.

Tragically, 18 Christian Palestinians lost their lives in the attack, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, and the number of injured individuals remains unknown at this time.⁠

The Church of St. Porphyrius has a long history, with its original construction dating back to the 5th century and its present structure built in the 12th century.⁠

The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem strongly condemned the Israeli airstrike on its church compound in Gaza reiterating its commitment to providing refuge for Palestinian civilians.⁠

instagram,"Like America did on September 11, 2001, Israel went into shock on October 7. Until that day, it had been a long time since the western world rallied around Israel. After former president Obama’s shunning, America has recommitted to her ally. But there are cowards amid the chaos, and many of them are Hollywood celebrities.

Upon seeing Hamas’s barbarism, you’d think all celebrities would rush to condemn it. However, Hollywood pearl clutchers who screamed “Black Lives Matter” have been quiet, late to denounce, or insistent that the conflict is ‘complicated.’

We cannot tolerate silence or lukewarm condolences from celebrities who spent the last few years chastising Americans for issues far less blatantly binary than this one. When Hamas targets the most vulnerable for murder and other unspeakable crimes, it’s a fight for civilization, not just Israeli sovereignty. Celebrities should be consistent and say, “Neutrality is not an option.”

——
“This year, our message revolves around global harmony and peace.”

The Path to Peace: A world flawed by conflict often leads us to confine the dove, symbolizing peace, within a cage. However, it is high time we free the essence of peace and contain the destructive power of missiles instead. We are  translating this powerful concept into an artistic costume, aiming to convey a profound message of peace, a sentiment deeply ingrained in Nepal's identity as a peace-loving nation. Nepal represents peace through its longstanding commitment to non-violence, its peaceful coexistence with diverse cultures, and its status as a neutral and harmonious nation. The costume is meticulously designed in colors that resonate with the choices of peace advocates, symbolizing their unwavering commitment to the cause of peace. 🤍

Kudos to the creators 💪👏💯
The headgear represents a cloud in the sky, filled with missiles.

instagram,"It was a long journey last night and I’ve never come closer to missing a connecting flight but miraculously Laura and I and even our gear has reached Tbilisi! Playing tonight with new material and a whole new format geared towards the club 🖤

Images by @laxdoela from our performance in Munich. 

Also just want to add that these last few days have led to the sharpest uptick of really nasty messages in my DMs that I’ve ever seen. Standing up for human rights means standing up for humans EVERYWHERE to live in peace. My passion on this subject is derived from having visited Auschwitz at 15 and truly internalised the message ‘never again’. It is starkly clear to me that violence against civilians is never the conflict resolution technique that those in power think it is. Trauma remains in our bodies and hearts for generations, and the trauma in the eyes of every child in Gaza and Israel shatters my heart because I know it will remain with them forever. This is not an issue that should be considered controversial. Please take a moment to imagine that those of us taking a stand are doing so because we care about HUMANS and wish to stand on a side of history that allows us to sleep at night. 

That said, the messages of support have been even more plentiful. And tend to be from those with far more at stake in the conflict, Palestinians and Israelis alike. Many have expressed that they don’t feel like they can be outspoken for fear of consequences and that’s really alarming. 

So please, if you have a platform and a voice, and the only thing you’re afraid of is losing a few followers, don’t remain quiet. The reward to your conscience will outweigh the pushback from those who don’t yet understand what we’re fighting for.",,1504,"{'like_count': 1457, 'comment_count': 47, 'num_users': 24293}",Zanias,,2023-10-20 10:51:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323747785_1296701181185186_6319468905602713953_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=PaIN1dEKmMwAX9-4xyV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCI_WawWIpMCQfYPeoDmojZCMI8qjIB-YABEpG8sKGpGQ&oe=655B5D3D,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyni-urotpk/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394276680_186103421136830_4538475985225799698_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=uFeTZu3bJMcAX9sk4Wp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfArFLWKApodzf5GX50-9xycsRty5ZnN8kwgsd_jMDxH7A&oe=655A78BE
instagram,"Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Leo starts with an acknowledgment that it’s inspired by A History of Violence (2005), the David Cronenberg action thriller based on John Wagner’s graphic novel of the same title. A History of Violence is about a man who wants his past self dead. He is devastated when he finds him still alive. Leo’s Parthiban seems caught between wanting to pay homage to this hero and pandering to the fans who want Vijay to be a remorseless badass.

The conflict, therefore, is just your regular masala film conflict – it’s external and rooted in all the bad people who have to be killed one after the other. Lokesh seems unsure of what he wants Parthiban to be – is he regretful or ashamed of his past, or does he revel in living under a stolen identity?

instagram,"The world is never entirely up or down at the same time. This past weekend, I was lucky enough to find myself standing in the center of an “up.” I married my best friend, and love’s gravity revealed itself through our family and friends. I’m grateful for that, and it really put some things into perspective that I refuse to take for granted. These sort of moments are made through love itself. Through kindness. Consideration. Unity. Love is, and will never not be complicated, but it’s always worth it. It is the strongest foundation we can build our lives on, and it starts one brick at a time. One moment at a time. One good deed at a time. It exists in ebb and flow, and we’re unable to receive it without giving it first, unconditionally. That’s not always easy, as the past two weeks of conflict in particular have shown. Wherever you are at the moment (up, down, or somewhere in the middle), I wish love upon you, and I hope you share it ❤️🙏🏻",,1446,"{'like_count': 1398, 'comment_count': 48, 'num_users': 73529}",G R E G  •  F U R M A N,,2023-10-20 12:46:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/30856090_2079246025677132_3998871507584417792_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JP3elTk8hUcAX91Z1jG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBrv3cLIY8fYnESU4heN2XA0WK4srAglk16GGkOx9hboA&oe=655B1D40,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynwOHcMHOD/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393286462_862290438543286_8763648683687482261_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=PNV_kdkUY8sAX_UHioW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCUOQuS9luiRe7Td5vCFp3NvxGIU7hae0SIccg9HNP3Tg&oe=6559B2B8

instagram,"Over 150 Berkeley High students walked out of class Wednesday in a pro-Palestine rally to call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war after the surprise deadly attack by Hamas almost two weeks ago and the retaliatory airstrikes by Israelis.

The protest is part of a larger day of action organized by the Arab Resource Organizing Center of San Francisco. The attack by Hamas on Israeli soil left at least 1,400 Israelis dead. More than 3,300 people in Gaza have died since Israel began retaliatory air strikes in the territory, according to the BBC, and a ground offensive is expected.

“We refuse to stay silent while so many families are being massacred and millions are being forcibly displaced,” one Berkeley High student said at the protest.

“We are calling for an end to the occupation that Palestinians have endured for 75 years,” said another.

Marching from Civic Center Park to UC Berkeley, students chanted, “Stop bombing Gaza” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”

Students at the rally drew attention to the plight of Palestinians over several decades of armed conflict in the region, describing Israel’s hand in creating an apartheid state that they said operates like an open-air prison. Since Hamas seized power in 2007, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip, home to more than 2 million Palestinians, controlling trade and restricting residents’ movement in and out of Gaza.

instagram,"#flashbackfriday At times, as a door gunner, I was fortunate enough to witness glimpses of the serenity that Afghanistan had to offer from a birds eye view.
Looking at it, sometimes could be so breathtaking that you are so wrapped up in it, you don’t even think to take a picture. For brief moments, you forget about the chaos, your take off and LZ hard times, fuel checks, your purpose for even being there…you’re just a human, in awe at the magnitude of the landscape.
The landscape that has stood the test of time and countless attempts at invasion by foreigners from a far away “more civilized” place…
The result in the end? The same. Forever a barrier, forever a fortress to those who have lived there for thousands of years, forever wild and ruthless…BUT, forever breathtaking.
As it was, as it is, as it will be.
Whatever feelings I have about the “conflict” are irrelevant. In those moments where we were pulled out of it for even a second, and just existed so very vividly…is where I learned to simply just “be”.

instagram,"Charges laid following officer-involved shooting

One man has been arrested and charged in relation to a shooting incident that occurred in September 2023, on Glenmore Trail and in the southeast community of Seton. One man was transported to hospital in serious condition as a result of the September shooting. It is believed that both the offenders and victim are associated to rival organized crime groups in Calgary, and that the victim was targeted due to this conflict.

Investigators identified several potential suspects, and given their demonstrated violence and history of court-ordered firearm prohibitions, investigators engaged the Tactical Unit to conduct the arrests of the suspects.

📍 On Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2023, while attempting to arrest two suspects, an officer-involved shooting occurred at approximately 2:40 p.m., in the 5700 block of Falsbridge Drive N.E. One suspect was pronounced deceased and one police officer was transported to hospital in stable condition. A second suspect was taken into custody, and upon his arrest, officers located a loaded handgun in his possession. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding the officer-involved shooting and no additional details can be released about this incident.

Today, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2023, officers executed a search warrant on the suspect’s vehicle, which resulted in the seizure of two additional loaded handguns. Photos of these firearms are included in this post. 

📌Thanh NGUYEN, 25, of Calgary, has been charged with one count each of attempted murder, discharge a firearm with intent, possession of stolen property over $5,000, unlawful possession of a firearm in a vehicle, unlawful possession of a restricted firearm with ammunition, possession of a weapon obtained by crime and possession of a restricted firearm contrary to a prohibition order.

instagram,"I’m half Palestinian. One of my best friends is half Jewish (top left) We both have relatives in the conflict zone. I care about the safety of his family. He cares about the safety of mine. Both of us were born in the United States and grew up without a deep connection to this part of our heritage. I was adopted and only just a few years ago found out my biological father and that whole side of my family is Palestinian. It led me to meet blood relatives for the very first time. I think this conflict is difficult for both of us in the sense of identity. On one hand, we were not raised with the deep cultures of our people...and yet in recent years, we have embarked on our own separate journeys to connect with the culture and history of our ancestors. He would take a bullet for me and I would take a bullet for him. But we wonder how things would be if our upbringings were different. Would we be able to get along during this time? Maybe in a different world, we might even see each other on opposite sides of a battlefield? The point of this post is not about “taking sides”. I see many people putting a spotlight on the violence and bloodshed that has taken place and continues to take place. I think the point is maybe hope?... hope of co-existing? It’s so hard to see all this death. There are aunties, uncles and even siblings I’ve never met yet who I worry I might never get a chance to meet. I won’t pretend to be an expert on the Middle East. But what I do know is this...when you take away the titles. “Palestinian” “Jewish”....that’s what me and Sam are. That’s a truth. But our other truth is that we consider each other brothers...not by blood...but by the love and respect we have for each other as HUMAN BEINGS…and I just feel like that’s getting lost in all of this.",,1315,"{'like_count': 1243, 'comment_count': 72, 'num_users': 10950}",Eddie Dowd,,2023-10-20 09:01:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/348348014_1266723030626797_6597653538322301906_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=p4Z3oKTvXG0AX-yNAEg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA4XKgDIoiJbTZlx3Zk86PL-Aq_-x34mHYppROfxkqfZg&oe=655B8AF5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynWX1DuyP9/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393373910_24118885654425148_9086391214343047112_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4btR6vpdupUAX8Ca-1O&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA9z6sxtTgY0lCzoxaZ9ijTp3HdEjsj6-cPYYaPLLM5uA&oe=6559BBB3
instagram,"The United States using its veto power to block a UN Security Council Resolution for a 'humanitarian pause' in Gaza has once again ignited debates about the efficacy of the United Nations, particularly in times of conflict. The Security Council is the UN organ primarily tasked with maintaining international peace and security. It can issue ceasefire directives, deploy peacekeeping troops, and impose economic sanctions – the only UN body with the power to take tangible measures as opposed to recommendations. In 2005, UN member states affirmed their responsibility to collectively protect their populations from genocide. The World Summit Outcome Document states: “The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity…in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council…”⁠
⁠
However, the notion of the UN's ""neutrality"" comes under scrutiny – raising questions about whether it is a mere tool for powerful nations to exert geopolitical dominance rather than being an agent of peace and change. Despite the UN proclaiming the sovereign equality of its members, its Security Council – somewhat paradoxically – grants permanent membership and veto power to the five victors of the Second World War, making it inherently undemocratic to many member states.⁠
⁠
Further, the organization’s commitment to neutrality, too – often obscured by ideas of impartiality – fosters a ""white savior"" lens, implying that Western actors are uniquely qualified to intervene in conflicts when it aligns with their objectives, undermining the agency of local actors and perpetuating power imbalances. This raises valid concerns about the organization's ability to act as a true global force for positive change, particularly when powerful nations exert influence through mechanisms like veto power in the Security Council.",,1295,"{'like_count': 1277, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 375442}",The Swaddle,,2023-10-20 08:24:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/362969069_669248131894624_8418662243304924182_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=rz9gQg-4CIUAX-xwouB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDt3ONHZl5h5txALTikgqgH8lYms-fDw2yiQr2lqxcWjQ&oe=6559D8E6,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynSIkdMxFe/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/393681441_672453388285450_2276667508233341514_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Jc5n7B8dTg4AX-rOS6L&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDC0aJJYD1tlr6Dhsw64JpAk1msu3b0n6RbwjujXNQOsA&oe=653F0549

instagram,"The devil you know…

Day 17 (albeit a little late), and piece 7/8 of my Inktober prompt inspired collection: demon 😈

This design is one of my personal favorites from this collection. The detail of the blood/tears are something I’m especially pleased with.  It represents two sides to a story— is the creature bleeding or crying? And if so, why? It’s easy to misinterpret things we don’t fully understand. I could come up with examples but it would be an infinite list.

I find that misunderstandings are the source of much conflict that could otherwise be avoided or worked through. It’s easy to reach for a conclusion based on the bias of what we *do* know and how we feel, but that leaves out truths we aren’t aware of. 

Perspective is everything. And oftentimes, we’re only privy to a single one: our own. Imagine that… one perspective, trying to interpret a world made of billions. It makes sense that there would be a lot of misunderstanding…",,1258,"{'like_count': 1239, 'comment_count': 19, 'num_users': 34674}",Glass artist • marissa baker,,2023-10-20 01:39:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/338219217_161156843488891_5868260481854031486_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=8OSXMBN6tKEAX-tWm13&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAn9x4oPZywbNudvnLfhly6vgYc2TguJCV3-mkvGneuSA&oe=655A455B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CymjzobRUwF/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393463985_215563214751147_3303944817178520566_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Utw0mDG-uSAAX_ZN-xr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDSU4jnEMXgd8aQc9UqjZboZJjo3BuqFq8TGSLrZ1ikFg&oe=655AD8F9

In April of this year, violent civil conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces broke out and displaced at least 5.6 million people.

That conflict has meant that for months, on-the-ground responders in Sudan have struggled to secure access to supply routes, electricity, internet, and fuel.

But there’s good news: Thanks to the collaborative effort between @projecthopeorg, @airlinkflight, and other partners — $13 million worth of vital aid supplies is being deployed to help people Sudan.

Countries, territories and cities that are facing conflict are also more likely to be at the forefront of the impacts of the climate crisis. It disproportionately affects those who are already in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. 

Decolonisation means an end to the occupation, but it also means tackling the climate crisis head on.

instagram,"The lawyer of Karim Benzema has hit back at France’s interior minister after he accused the French football star who plays for Saudi team Al-Ittihad of links to the Muslim Brotherhood group.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin made the accusations after the reigning Ballon d’Or winner and former Real Madrid forward posted a message on social media about the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.

“All our prayers are for the inhabitants of Gaza who are once again victims of these unjust bombings which spare no women or children,” Benzema wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

instagram,"Palestinians eagerly await the first international aid delivery to Gaza, on Friday, as Israeli forces pounded the enclave and warned of a ground invasion ""soon"", continuing its relentless air strikes for more than 13 days.

The Rafah crossing in Egypt has been out of operation amid Israeli bombardments on Gaza, causing dwindling chances of aid entering the region.

The US Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues, David Satterfield, is negotiating aid delivery modalities with Israeli and Egyptian officials.

The United Nations (UN) has called for aid to return to pre-conflict levels of 100 trucks a day. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres planned to visit the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza on Friday, a move that Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, told a rally in New York City showed that ""his top priority is giving aid to the terrorists.""

The journalist also shared how Egypt has held a special place in their hearts, and that they have been meaning to visit it sometime. 

“Egypt has long held a special place in [Raffy Tima]'s and my hearts as a dream destination. Unfortunately, circumstances have prevented us from visiting until now,” Mariz wrote in her social media posts. 

“Raffy is currently in Egypt, covering the expected repatriation of Filipinos who were caught in the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza,” she added, extending her support to Raffy. 

“Ingat ka diyan, mahal! You’re doing an exceptional job covering everything on your own,” she continued. 

“For the time being, I’ll have to be content with glimpses of the pyramids in the background during our video chats,” she concluded: “Ingat mahal and balik tayo diyan ha?”

instagram,"The black bear has risen in stature to one of our state’s most valued animals – by wildlife watchers and hunters alike. Maine’s expansive northern, eastern, and western forest supports the largest population of black bears in the eastern United States, and MDIFW’s black bear monitoring program is one of the most extensive and longest-running programs of its type in the U.S.

Our bear management program strives to balance biological and social needs and uses long-term monitoring of black bears, harvest data, and conflict data to inform management decisions. Maine’s 10-year big game management plan includes goals, objectives, and a series of management strategies designed to ensure continued enjoyment of black bears without too many conflicts in backyards and neighborhoods.

To learn more about Maine black bear monitoring, management, harvest, conflict prevention, and research, take a look through the Game Species Conservation & Management Section of the 2022-2023 Research + Management Report by following the link in our bio.

instagram,"New Delhi: At least 21 journalists were among the more than 4,000 dead in Israel and Palestine since the war started on October 7, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

As of Thursday, the committee reported that of the 21 confirmed dead, 17 journalists were Palestinian, three Israeli and one Lebanese. Eight journalists were also reported injured and three were reported missing or detained.

“CPJ emphasizes that journalists are civilians doing important work during times of crisis and must not be targeted by warring parties,” said Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. “Journalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heartbreaking conflict. All parties must take steps to ensure their safety.”

More journalists have been killed in Gaza during the past two weeks than since 2001 in the territory, Mansour told AP. Reporters in Gaza face power and internet outages under Israeli siege, and many have lost their offices, homes and family members.

Gaza health officials said as of Thursday, Israel’s airstrikes have killed 3,785 people and wounded more than 12,000. These airstrikes came after the Hamas militant group attacked Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people. Israel said at least 203 people are being held hostage in Gaza.

CPJ published descriptions of the journalists killed, injured, detained and missing so far.

Of the reporters killed is Ahmed Shehab, a journalist for Sowt Al-Asra Radio (Radio Voice of the Prisoners). Shehab was killed in an Israeli airstrike on October 12 that struck his house in the northern Gaza Strip, along with his wife and three children, according to The New Arab.

instagram,"JANM condemns the recent anti-Muslim hate crime in Plainfield, Illinois. Six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume and his mother, Hanaan Shahin, were stabbed multiple times by their landlord, killing Wadea and seriously injuring Hanaan. When the landlord expressed that he was angry at her for what was happening in Israel and she responded by saying “let’s pray for peace,” he attacked her and her son with a military-style knife. The hate crime was motivated by the landlord’s anti-Muslim bias and his anger about the Israel-Hamas war. He was charged with three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery, and two counts of committing a hate crime. 

“We are deeply saddened by this hateful act and by the rise of anti-Muslim and antisemitic rhetoric that has erupted in the US in the wake of the conflict in the Middle East. We grieve for the loss of life in the conflict and for the life of this child who was so brutally murdered. When fear and insecurity bind together, they create a dangerous poison that can inflict grave harm on individuals, heaping ongoing trauma onto communities, and etching deep wounds into humanity that fuels hate speech and violence.

instagram,"Despite the economy's resilience, the largest American banks have been discreetly reducing their workforce throughout the year, with the exception of JPMorgan Chase. The reductions are attributed to various factors, including the impact of higher interest rates on the mortgage industry, decreased Wall Street deal-making, and rising funding costs. 💼

🏦  The five largest U.S. banks, excluding JPMorgan Chase, have collectively cut 20,000 positions due to the sudden overstaffing following the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. 📉

Financial industry job losses are expected to continue in 2024 as lenders grapple with rising loan defaults. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have witnessed the most significant staff reductions, driven by revenue declines in key areas. 

Goldman Sachs, although not planning another mass layoff, anticipates further decreases in headcount. 🙅‍♂️📈

Attrition in the financial sector has been low, leaving banks with more employees than anticipated. While some banks are still hiring, the overall trend is toward workforce reduction. 🚶‍♂️👷‍♀️

JPMorgan stands out as an exception due to its successful navigation of the changing economic landscape. However, for most banks, there is still room for further cuts as they adapt to evolving conditions. 🏆🔄💼

Speaking in his office today, after being handed the report from the committee that conducted an investigation for seven days, from October 7 to October 13, this year, Mr. Chalamila said the fire was an act of sabotage fueled by a conflict between the businessmen of the area and their leadership.

""The narratives of the traders and security guard who were interviewed after the incident seemed to have been rehearsed because they did not match what was on the CCTV footage,"" he said.

He continued, ""The generator was not the source of the fire as it was initially claimed; the fire was started in the auction market.""

The committee's report confirmed that the fire burned and consumed the entire area of the Kariakoo auction market, including 550 business stalls, 10 shops, and seven tall buildings, including those surrounding the area, while six people were injured by the fire.",,886,"{'like_count': 881, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 38149}",The Citizen Tanzania,,2023-10-20 11:47:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/356966947_184849637654530_4410051697908151839_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=sVvg0bEibmIAX9j0qvU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAS74WjgNdtv9avfP42F4jYtbsb0AuT7QpjGdwWWJAa_w&oe=6559E925,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynpYYxoSGN/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393728494_1007387543835076_1276164434388146541_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=3GEFa_dKqtcAX9esB9Z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDfIN4hhh1F81bdMBfTlrfpiwzk3CHp3kAYzEfPlNJoZQ&oe=65394E23
instagram,"Why She Doesn't Lust For You Anymore ❤️‍🔥

A couple years ago, the s/x started to dry up in my relationship.

Obviously this was extremely frustrating to me, because I'm supposed to be ""the S/xual Kung Fu guy"".

This was when I realized that it's one thing to have mastery in s/xual skills, but the dynamic of s/xual attraction and polarity is a separate factor - one I actually realized I didn't know much about. I was just trying to do what came naturally to me.

This lead me on a journey to understand the dynamics of sexual attraction, and this was when I realized I had been a feminized ""nice guy"". 

I had the tendency to avoid conflict with my woman at all costs, to initiate sex in indirect ways, and to suppress some of my deepest primal sexual desires.

I was not in my masculine strength, I was hiding it beneath a fake smile and a tendency to act nice and avoid speaking my true thoughts to please others.

I began to step into my assertive strength and leadership.

I started being very direct with my woman, expressing exactly what I wanted. I began to lead in our relationship.

I stopped hiding my resentments and using passive-aggressive unconscious behaviors.

I learned how to hold strong masculine presence - rather than trying to be my woman's 'friend' or 'therapist', I became her man. 

And I noticed a night-and-day difference in my relationship.

The sexual attraction became reignited, and I started having some of the most passionate and fulfilling sex of my life, with a woman I've lived in the same home with for 5 years. 

I'm seeing a lot of other men stuck in the same dynamics of people pleasing, nice guy syndrome, and settling for passionless sexless relationships.

As men, we were set up to fail in the modern world, never taught how to manage our sexual energy, how to manage our emotions, or how to sustain a passionate and balanced relationship.

This is why I created my new Sex God course - to guide you on the same transformation I went through 💥

instagram,"DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS. ⁣
⁣
so many of them are happening right now. And I’ve been hearing from lots of people that they are paralyzed, stuck in the conflict over authenticity and attachment. ⁣
⁣
We are born with a natural need for attachment. To our parents, our families, our communities. But we are also born with a fire of authenticity inside of us. We burn with the desire to be who we are, feel how we feel, think how we think. ⁣
⁣
These two things can find themselves in direct conflict with one another. ⁣
⁣
So, how do we stay attached to the people we love while still maintaining some level of our authenticity? The answer is, we tell the truth. When something is hard to say, instead of concocting a narrative that will convince somebody of your position, just say: I don’t know how to do this. I’m lost. This is so hard to say.⁣
⁣
If you find yourself at an impasse, tell the truth. Not “the truth” that is the opposite of a lie. The truth that is the slow, mindful translation of your heart. Whatever that may be.⁣
⁣
You can do this. I send you big love.⁣💫

instagram,"After a Pune institute cancelled its media award to Kashmiri journalist Safina Nabi, the Network of Women in Media, India wrote to the institute expressing “disappointment” over its “lack of commitment to press freedom”.

“Ordinarily, the award would have signalled your institution’s recognition of the critical importance of storytelling in areas of intense conflict. To withdraw from that responsibility is a sad reflection of the journalism education you purport to stand for,” the letter said.

Weaving influences from a wide palette of styles across electro, IDM, techno, trance, breaks and experimental sounds, the Ukranian composer and DJ builds stories and shapes patterns seemingly from another dimension, yet clearly close to heart.

Undoubtedly a commentary on experienced hardship, strong willed hope, unjust conflict and most importantly the power of expression through music, SMART-155 is a testament to possibilities and a reminder of the importance of unity.

instagram,"Humanitarian aid to Gaza remains blocked in Egypt

Trucks of a humanitarian aid convoy are parked outside the border gate between Egypt and Gaza, in Rafah, Egypt on Thursday as volunteers from aid organizations continue their sit-in in front of the Rafah border gate demanding the opening of the crossing and allowing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. International mediators have pushed for the passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the evacuation of foreign nationals fleeing the conflict, even as Israel has warned all citizens of the Gaza Strip to move to the south ahead of an expected invasion following the Hamas attacks on October 7.

Today, as the media wages a war against truth and strips this conflict of its historical context, we have a unique responsibility to use our voice and artistic practices to say NO MORE! Now is the time to protest apartheid and amplify the just cause of the Palestinian people and their resistance against 75 years of occupation.

“The last thing I want to do around her is behave.”

What a fun, magical grump/sunshine read Wolf Gone Wild is! Matteo is hexed, unable to shift and his wolf is constantly taunting him, so he finds a witch to help break this curse. Evie is one of the best hex-breakers out there, and seeing how Matteo is struggling, she agrees to help him, and spend four hours a day with him, since it seems being around her calms not only Matteo, but the wolf—Alpha—too, and once he seems Evie, he’s decided she’s his. This is a slow burn read, a grump/sunshine, friends to lover, and just has a lot of sexy tension. These two have amazing chemistry and I loved the balance and struggle of Matteo and his wolf. The magic in this story is captivating and the magical community is so fleshed out. Alpha is so sexy and I loved his forwardness. I loved the banter of Alpha and Matteo but also the banter of Matteo and Evie. Matteo is so sweet and endearing, and Evie is just a nerdy burst of sunshine. They’re so fun and I loved watching the two bloom and grow with each other. Their chemistry is so sweet and sexy, and I love the magical conflict so much. I always love a witchy read and this one didn’t disappoint! 

What are you up to this weekend?

The statement confirmed that the club’s management held a discussion with the Moroccan international footballer, where he clarified his position on the Palestine-Israel conflict.

“The reason for the discussion was Mazraoui’s Instagram posts in connection with the terror attack against Israel almost two weeks ago, which led to irritation and criticism,” the club said.

20 years after Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, exhumations continue. Conflict between Shining Path and the Peruvian government in the 1980s/90s led to almost 70,000 deaths and 15,000 people missing. 

For over 10 years Musuk Nolte has been documenting the process of grieving and the search for justice.

1.  Residents of Pujas accompany the remains of friends and relatives for burial.

2. Relatives of Arquimides Rua Gamboa watch the reconstruction of the remains of their father's body as it is returned to them.

3. Relatives gather at a wake after the bodies of those who were kidnapped and then murdered by a Peruvian army patrol in 1983 were returned by the Peruvian public ministry. 

4. A man wipes a portrait of Claudio Morales, killed by the terrorist group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) in 1984. On 17 January, at around 4am, a squad entered the Morales family house while they slept. Without a known motive, they killed the four adults including Claudio, leaving 5 children who witnessed the murders and lived with the bodies for four days due to the isolation of their home.

5. Alejandrina Valenzuela cries as she stands in front of the coffins of her parents.

6. Burning candles at a mass wake for more than 100 victims of the Accomarca massacre. On 14 August 1985, a military patrol under the command of Telmo Hurtado killed almost all the residents of Accomarca, alleging they were members of Shining Path. Hurtado, nicknamed 'the butcher of the Andes', is now in prison after being extradited from the United States.

7. A wake in Pujas.

8. Urbano Huamani Vegara (47) during a burial service for his brother. 

9. On 16 July 1984 40 members of Shining Path commandeered a local bus travelling. Stopping in various towns, the guerrillas murdered over one hundred people who refused to join their ranks. The remains of 14 of those killed are finally put to rest in the Soras cemetery.

10. Zosimo Hilario whose father was murdered in 1991 along with 12 other family members by an army patrol.

Netta also described how life in Israel has been the last two weeks and wrote that it is “important to me that the world understands”.

“I don’t think I can go out and tour in the US right now when my country is bleeding,” Netta added.

“It just doesn’t feel right. This would be followed by an official statement but I needed to say how I feel,” the young singer concluded.

Netta performed in Malta during EuroPride Valletta’s opening ceremony where where, just before her performance, activists put up Palestinian flags as a form of protest against the Israeli’s singer choice to be a part of the week-long celebration

instagram,"New Delhi: Over 1,300 writers and publishers from around the world have signed a letter of support for Palestinian literary voices, including author Adania Shibli, after reports emerged from across the world where events featuring Palestinian art, voices, and stories had been cancelled in the wake of Hamas’ terror attack on Israel.

The letter is the effort of ArabLit, an organisation which publishes ArabLit Quarterly magazine featuring several translated works from Arabic.

“These recent, terrible days have seen – in several European countries – a closing-off and shutting down of cultural events that bring forward Palestinian art, voices, and stories,” noted ArabLit on its website.

The letter makes particular reference to award-winning Palestinian author Adania Shibli, wherein a ceremony scheduled for her to receive a prestigious award was cancelled in the wake of the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.

Shibli, who was a finalist for the 2020 National Book Award for her book Minor Detail (New Directions/Fitzcarraldo, translated by Elisabeth Jaquette), was to receive Germany’s 2023 LiBeraturpreis for the same book, published in German as Eine Nebensache (Berenberg Verlag, translated by Günther Orth) at the 2023 Frankfurt Book Fair, which begins next week.

Staff Reporter

THE Army Battle School at Nehale lyaMpingana Barracks was a scene of celebration and achievement on the 13th of October as it hosted a joint graduation ceremony for four significant military courses.

These courses, the 11th Company Group Commanders Course, the 14th Platoon Commanders Course, the Platoon Sergeant Course, and the Section Commander's Course, aimed to equip students with essential knowledge in both Conventional Warfare and Low-Intensity Conflict Operations.

The ceremony was officiated by Brigadier General Andreas Diyeve, the Deputy Army Commander, and he extended his heartfelt congratulations to the graduates for their outstanding performances throughout the demanding training. General Diyeve emphasized the vital role these programs play in developing a highly trained military force.

In his address, the Deputy Army Commander stressed the cornerstone of success for all armed forces: training. He encouraged graduates at all levels and soldiers alike to cultivate a culture of continuous learning. He underlined the significance of prioritizing training to ensure that the defence force remains fully prepared to fulfil its national mandate in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Namibia. General Diyeve noted, ""It is, therefore, of paramount importance that all commanders and uniformed personnel prioritize training.""

Expressing his gratitude, the General acknowledged the Course Officers, Instructors, and all supporting staff for their unwavering dedication and commitment to imparting valuable knowledge and innovations to the members. Their contributions played a pivotal role in the success of the graduates.

Notably, the students who completed these courses came from all branches of the Namibian Defence Force (NDF): The Army, Air Force, and Namibian Navy. This joint graduation ceremony symbolized the unity and shared commitment of the entire NDF to empower the next generation of military leaders.",,755,"{'like_count': 755, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 85834}",Informanté,,2023-10-20 08:00:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/20180736_1601072236579369_4513036477973659648_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=GzRvk99Q6l8AX-Kyf4B&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCtJ8f1MJl4YQEwXgwgdi_4sdZD266S0U3UVsN7I-TyEg&oe=655B84FE,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynPZr1uCfs/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391628545_621573413518389_8545471418353015783_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=OMmk3o3UpQQAX-OwlN2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAj2HqTz8gmkfoHaK9g2veyWWlyqaMY8BFvkbCM_H1ytg&oe=653921C6

instagram,"“ @jannikabel and @marthe__valle have written a letter, signed by over 2453 cultural workers in Norway in support of Palestine - demanding that the Norwegian government do all they can to defend international law against the ongoing war crimes.”

Watching suppressed and desperate people forgotten by the world suffer even more, not ever seeing any change to their situation after 75 years, is heartbreaking. We condemn killings of ALL CIVILIANS, but there is no doubt about who has the real power to change the situation and end the constant fear for people on both sides. 

The suppressors successful efforts in confusing the world makes us even more angry; even achieving in making our own media report about the genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, and occupation as a part of a “conflict”...

It’s all just fucking unbelievable! 

The nuclear state’s recent boasting of their 6000 bombs dropped over defenseless people caught inside the world’s biggest prison, is DISGRACEFUL. Frightening. Disgusting. Sickening. Appalling. Inhuman. 

We join in on calling out to our leaders in the “peace nation” of Norway, to condemn the actions of the fascist extreme-right government of the so-called “only functioning democracy of the Middle East”, where the prime minister himself is facing corruption charges. Who’s government recently succeeded in making constitutional changes to shift power away from the supreme courts to parliament. A “democracy” where a whole ethnic group are treated as second-rank inhabitants, not even allowing them to be titled citizens, but rather permanent residents. 

As we one day review history this occupation and never-endig genocide will always stand out as a dark stain on humanity.

instagram,"What feminism has taught me about nuance, grief, and loving across hard lines: A note from Charis Circle on Israel and Palestine. ⁠
⁠
“Feminism taught me that power changes all who possess it. Feminism taught me that often where we begin telling the story of a conflict determines who the enemy is, as does the person telling the tale. Feminism taught me that “war crime” is redundant because war is always a crime. Feminism taught me to fear fundamentalism of all kinds, and to fear theocratic fundamentalism the most, because women, children, queers, and trans people rarely thrive under conditions of religious fundamentalism. Feminism taught me that as long as we believe that only some children are “our” children, no children will be safe and free. Feminism taught me that a human life destroyed by state violence–whether by bomb or famine or lack of electricity–is not substantively different from a human life destroyed by more direct human hands. Feminism taught me that violence begets violence and vengeance is not justice. Feminism taught me that resistance often goes unvalued and unnoticed when it is led by women, when it is not sensational, when it is generative and collaborative. Feminism taught me that people seeking freedom from violence will sometimes use violence when it is the language that finally makes them heard. Feminism taught me that language, all language, is power. Feminism taught me that we must not abandon our radical imaginations. Feminism taught me it is possible to be in enormous pain and rage and not abandon each other.” ⁠

People rarely turn into killing machines in a vacuum. The Hamas leadership must be eradicated, sure, but what does that mean? Without a change in policy and a philosophical commitment to humanizing relationships on both sides, despite the historical hardships, is it reasonable to expect a different outcome? 

Netanyahu has been in power for 16 years and his myopic leadership is at least in part responsible for the utter failure to prevent this tragedy. 

Hamas, on the other hand, has been ruling Gaza since the last elections, 18 years ago. In a survey conducted in 2021, the authoritarian government received merely 30% approval from its population. It is hard to imagine that number not plummeting given the scope of this ongoing destruction, inclusive of innocent Palestinians. 

To imagine peace we must refrain from retributive impulses; we must wipe the slate clean. Mandela and Gandhi taught us the value of forgiveness in the spirit of humanizing the peace process. 

Let us see in this tragedy an opportunity to usher in new leadership—on both sides—and reinvent a diplomatic coexistence based on shared values of peace and prosperity for all. Concessions must be made and a commitment to teach love rather than hate. Because the guttural pain of loss hurts universally. And we must forgive before more deaths escalate. 

As Buddha teaches, holding onto anger Is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. We stand with Israel and innocent Palestinians. We stand with peace.

instagram,"#TheGreatBattle

The Earth is ruled by Christ and Javhe who live in eternal struggle.  Christ is the leader of Gods.  Javhe is the chief of demons. Javhe is that terribly perverse demon who tempted Christ when he took him atop a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.  Thus, when tempting Christ, Javhe said: “ITABABO.  All these things will I give thee, If thou wilt fall down and worship me.” Christ answered and said unto him: “Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, but thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”

Javhe is a terribly perverse fallen Angel. Javhe is the genius of evil. Christ is the leader of the great White Lodge and Javhe, his antithesis, is the chief of the great Black Lodge. The powers of light and darkness live in eternal struggle and that struggle is rooted in sex. The semen is the battlefield.  In the semen, Angels and demons fight to the death.  The medullar bone of the great conflict between Angels and demons is sex.  There is the problem.  There is the root of all the white and black doctrines.  Christ has his program of action, Javhe has his.  The chosen follow the Christ.  The great majority of human beings fanatically follow Javhe.  Nevertheless, they all hide behind the cross. In the Astral Cross, there is a mutual struggle between the columns of Angels and demons. Facing each Angel, there is a demon.

instagram,"A fast-food restaurant, Chamas Tacos, in Valence, France faced the threat of administrative closure on Wednesday evening, all due to a malfunctioning outdoor sign. 

The sign’s letter “C” malfunctioned, causing the words “Hamas Tacos” to shine brightly in the night, a mishap that could easily lead to confusion, particularly during the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Valentine’s municipal police were alerted to this situation and swiftly intervened on Wednesday evening. They demanded the restaurant’s manager to completely switch off the illuminated sign and issued a warning of “administrative closure,” as documented in a video posted on TikTok and shared on X.

The Night Manager star gracefully confirmed their continued friendship during an interview with People, via USA Today, as he attended the Emmys. Asked if he and Swift were still friends, Hiddleston responded with a smile, ""Yes. Yes, we are."" When asked by The Telegraph whether he regretted the publicity and gossip generated by their relationship, Hiddleston exhibited a certain weariness, explaining, ""What should I regret, in your mind? I would rather not talk about this, if that's alright."" He further emphasized that everyone is entitled to a private life, stating, ""I’m just thinking about this. Everyone is entitled to a private life. I love what I do and I dedicate myself with absolute commitment to making great art and great entertainment, and in my mind, I don’t conflict the two. My work is in the public sphere and I have a private life. And those two things are separate.” Tom Hiddleston described Swift as ""an amazing woman. She’s generous and kind and lovely, and we had the best time.”"". Hiddleston's respectful approach to his past relationship serves as a testament to his ability to handle personal matters gracefully with complete authenticity.

Tight security arrangements were in place across the city as the authorities anticipated protests condemning Israeli use of force against Gaza after Friday prayers.

However, the crowd at many places including the Makkah Masjid mosque dispersed peacefully after the afternoon prayer.

instagram,"Death is political. Death is always political. Who dies, where they die, how they die, and whose bodies are respected, possible, and grievable are political questions of belonging and exclusion. Those buried within the manicured lawn of the cemetery, and those thrown into mass pits belong to different points along the same political continuum. 

The TD staff (and frankly, the majority of people you follow on social media) are not qualified to offer the proper historical analysis to current world events. But we do know who benefits and who does not from the violence facing us today. Those who benefit are those who want to keep us separated and polarized, those who try to convince us that we have incompatible stakes in this world, and those who benefit from the racist framing of contemporary violence. They are the weapons manufacturers, social media companies, political actors, nation-states, and fascists who refuse us all the possibility of a better world. 

In the fog of humanitarian crisis, war and violence, we can forget that, as the feminist scholar Judith Butler recently wrote, “The question of whose lives are worth grieving is an integral part of the question of whose lives are worth valuing.” There should be no lives more grievable than others, especially when those who die are rarely those who hold positions of power. The “collateral damage” of this conflict are families, women, and children, and people who loved and were loved and whose lives are so passively and callously ended. The dead and those who are left to grieve their deaths are the ones who lose. We all lose.

We know that many of you are grieving just as we are grieving right now. Some of you may be personally impacted by this violence and there is little to say that can remove that pain. Returning once again to Butler, “… hope no doubt seems naive, even impossible, to many. Nevertheless, some of us must rather wildly hold to it, refusing to believe that the structures that now exist will exist for ever.”",,649,"{'like_count': 649, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 46606}",talkdeathdaily,,2023-10-20 17:00:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/288640819_1747609745600071_6648073997224483312_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AoRXsS_tgNkAX_16pob&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAQ3Y1wxuo2yabxdexSYzfBOPD6xFUNdgHfoowSLrEGRg&oe=655AC5D8,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyoNMlavdQ-/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393518150_659913229652215_2149154763700277123_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=UAEJk0iXAGkAX8AWrAX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBXvBPL_ErTCkoe4VOYRwuSVZXvncigQ5JXwWo3wDdxvA&oe=655094FC

instagram,"To integrate the Ego is to understand why it’s broken into pieces.

It is to ask yourself why one is in deep conflict within oneself.

When the Ego is hurt because of traumatic past, it’s instinct is to self-protect.

It becomes essential to process this hurt. To rise above that insecurity and fear.

No matter how long it takes to keep walking that path that leads to inward clarity and resolve that inner conflict. 

I want to stand out but I also want to belong. I want to be free of fear but I am also attached. I want to discover, but I also presume to know. I want to teach but I am unwilling to learn. I want to trust myself, but I also doubt. I want to know who I am, yet I also compare.

To have an integrated ego to resolve all of this and to discover that this inward clarity and freedom is indeed possible.

Colombian president Gustavo Petro calls for a diplomatic approach towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, advocating for an international peace conference to explore the establishment of two independent and free states. Expressing solidarity with the children in the affected regions, Petro underscores that only a peace agreement, abiding by international law and promoting the right to coexistence, can ensure lasting tranquility in the region.

He said, “the only way for Palestinian children to sleep in peace is for Israeli children to sleep in peace” and vice versa.

“That will never be achieved by war, only by a peace agreement that respects international law and the right of both peoples to coexist freely,” he added.

instagram,"A US Navy warship in the Red Sea intercepted several missiles and drones launched from Yemen yesterday.

The USS Carney which is a guided-missile destroyer shot down multiple missiles launched by Iranian-backed Houthis which the Pentagon said were potentially headed toward targets in Israel.

This marks the first time in recent times where a US Navy ship in the Middle East engaged missiles and drones which were not directly aimed at the vessel. 

It is also the first U.S. military action taken to defend Israel during the ongoing conflict.

A Pentagon spokesman reported that the vessel intercepted three land attack cruise missiles and brought down eight drones.

The US Department of Defense has stated that any type of response to last night's cruise missile and drone launches will occur at a ""time and in a manner of our choosing”.

instagram,"Roughly three weeks after the fiasco over the Canadian parliament honouring a Ukrainian Nazi veteran, which caused him much embarrassment and the speaker his job, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to flip-flop in his response on the Hamas-Israel conflict. 

Trudeau first condemned Hamas — a Palestinian militant group in control of Gaza since 2007 — for its attacks on Israel, but later talked about the humanitarian situation emerging in Gaza, which has been facing Israeli airstrikes and a stringent, wide-ranging blockade on essentials. 

Then, he appeared to try and correct that tilt with a social media post condemning anti-semitism, and the appointment of a new holocaust special envoy. 

Israel declared “war” on Hamas after it launched a brutal assault on the country on 7 October.

instagram,"“If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself. If you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself. Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.” - Lao Tzu
🤍🕊
-
The outer world is a reflection of our inner worlds. What we see playing out is all a projection of the unhealed child. Of the needs and nourishment that have been unmet. So keep diving in to the places, the belief systems, the fear, the separation, the conditioning, the imprinting, the patterning and what’s unresolved within you that isn’t supporting love, that isn’t in alignment with the heart, that isn’t supportive of all of life, that causes harm and conflict within yourself and ultimately towards others as a projection of our inner self and keep reaffirming safety, compassion, gentleness, self-acceptance, nurturance, and kindness until you arrive back home. - 
As you become more in harmony and at peace with all of yourself, you too will extend that out to all others.

instagram,"New story, this one is important. Link in bio 🔗🇮🇱🇵🇸

“On October 7, H@mas militants launched the most brutal attack on Israel in our lifetimes, “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm.” We’ve heard and seen the many grisly details: women and children kidnapped, families gunned down and taken hostage, bodies burned and mutilated. What has gone curiously unreported in Western media—what is strangely missing from Wikipedia entries about the conflict—is why the invasion happened when it did. The average observer either views the attacks as unprovoked terror or a justified response to the totality of the Israeli system. The real reason, the hidden war, might just blow your mind.”

instagram,"This took some years in the making; I’m delighted that @mplusmuseum in Hong Kong has acquired 17 works from my “One Day We’ll Understand” project, across its multiple chapters looking at the history and memory of the anti-colonial war in Malaya. 
I'm eternally grateful to gallerist Johnson Chang of @hanarttzgallery for giving me my first solo show with this work, taking a chance on me even though he’s more used to representing blue-chip artists! It was the summer of 2019, a summer of turmoil on the streets of Hong Kong, leading astute reviewers to note the parallels within the walls of Johnson’s Pedder Street gallery and just outside, on the streets where public buses burnt — an echoing of an aspiration for a better political future, historical and contemporary. 
@arman.lam.37 helped this at-the-time newbie physically install the whole show, and has painstakingly handled this acquisition too. Thank you Arman! 

Special thanks to curator @isabttam for creating this opportunity and shepherding it tenaciously, and to the M+ team and committee. 

I’m also grateful to @zilbermangallery for helping me craft a second solo with the project, in Berlin, in 2021, developing an important new chapter “Interventions”, my reinterpretations of the British colonial archival photographic  prints around this conflict which I made anew as glass plates and exhibited accompanied by texts and voices representing multiple sides, perspectives to this complex war. 
@mzilberman1 and @lottelaub were partners, supporters and enablers in making that new chapter. 

@fostgallery also showed the earlier chapters of the work as a solo booth at @artbasel Hong Kong in 2022. Thank you. 

Thank you too to colleagues and friends who believed in the work from early on, and helped me craft those early shows, including @samishan, @utemeta , @anna_lovecchio_ at @ntu_ccasingapore where I was in residence in 2021 developing some of this work, Fang-tze Hsu, @jasewee and others.",,493,"{'like_count': 471, 'comment_count': 22, 'num_users': 102790}",Sim Chiyin 沈绮颖,,2023-10-20 18:25:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/39835975_276168439880953_1252803623365115904_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=jnhmYimExyAAX9jCckh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB_-RyOrg18Tqmow0g-acMxAwZOE82MiUlxkuxxNdMIOw&oe=655BA37C,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyoW90JLBrI/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394179300_348548144399623_4424649173819723090_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nV-4Yh2wOEAAX-cmqkk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA4n0GlEjO7T5RPZbPBAk-KFD0zU5x3paxNczQasvdx5g&oe=655A9F25

Currently, there are 172 Zambians living in Israel, with 143 being students and the remainder consisting of diplomats and other residents. 

The conflict in the Gaza Strip has resulted in the loss of approximately 3,000 lives.

Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Stanley Kakubo has Parliament that no Zambian has been killed in the conflict. 

Mr Kakubo said the Ministry is still in talks with the embassy there to ensure the welfare and safety of those who have chosen to stay back in the conflict zone.

The Minister was responding to a question raised by Pambashe Member of Parliament, Ronald Chitotela regarding the conflict in the Gaza Strip.

""I would like to highlight that Government has facilitated the voluntary, temporary relocation of all Zambians who have expressed a desire to return to our homeland for the time being. So far number totalling to 77 Zambians arrived safely in Lusaka as of October 18th, 2023, these include 72 students and five others. For those who have chosen to remain in Israel, be rest assured that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation will maintain close collaboration with the Embassy and the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and stands ready to take any necessary actions that will ensure their continued welfare and safety,"" he said. 

Mr Kakubo said President Hakainde Hichilema has reiterated the importance of Peace, Security and Stability and it is in this vein that Zambia reaffirms its commitment to ensuring peace, stability and security.

“The loss of lives in both Israel and the Gaza Strip is regrettable and we wish to extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to all the affected individuals and families.

instagram,"Ik geloof dat 'wereldvrede' een taak is voor ons allemaal.⁠
⁠
Vrede is méér dan de afwezigheid van oorlog. ⁠
Het is elkaar vinden waar verschil is. ⁠
Het is liefde durven kiezen boven angst.⁠
⁠
Ieder mens draagt de kans op vrede in zich. ⁠
Je kunt elk moment beginnen.⁠
⁠
Door vrede te sluiten met wie je zelf ten diepste bent. ⁠
Door vrede te sluiten met je verleden en je systeem, je angsten en je pijn, je vergissingen en je verlangens.⁠
⁠
Door liefdevol te kijken, naar jezelf en anderen. ⁠
Geen conflict toe te voegen waar het niet is.⁠
Te vergeven waar het wel is.⁠
⁠
Vrede betekent niet dat we allemaal hetzelfde moeten zijn; het betekent met liefde kijken naar het verschil.⁠
⁠
Ik geloof dat we dat kunnen.⁠
Misschien wel dat we het verplicht zijn aan onze kinderen om het in elk geval te proberen.⁠
⁠
Als ieder mens in vrede leeft met zichzelf, zal er vanzelf wereldvrede zal zijn.⁠
⁠
Wees lief voor elkaar.⁠

instagram,"🍾Opening reception Saturday November 11, 6-8pm🍾

Shulamit Nazarian is pleased to present “Sweet Discipline from Koreatown” an exhibition of new works by Ken Gun Min. In the artist’s newest paintings, lush, floral landscapes and sensitively rendered, imaginative portraits are adorned with beads and embroidery. 
 
The paintings in this exhibition exemplify Min's intersectional engagement with the nuances of queer experience as an Asian man and his deeply personal approach to often unexplored social spaces and histories. Yet even as he mines his own feelings and experiences, Min pulls a wide range of references and associations into the work to consider the ways that power, race, and sexuality play into both local and global geopolitics. Certain works reference the history of conflict between Asia and Europe, the dynamic history of relations between different minority groups in urban conflicts, and the intersection of sexual and racial prejudice. By exploring stories that span contemporary reality and earlier historical moments, the paintings expand outward from Min's personal journey through Los Angeles to address the sublime encounter of splendor and darkness in the human experience.

instagram,"STATEMENT ON ISRAEL AIRSTRIKE AT GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH IN GAZA

I have been notably silent on the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict as of late. I've done this because I did not want to distract from the current siege of Artsakh by the occupying Azerbaijani forces. As a Greek American, I consider the Armenian diaspora here in LA County to be my people because of our shared history and culture. 

Earlier tonight, IDF fighter jets launched an airstrike causing a Greek Orthodox church in central Gaza City to collapse, injuring many civilians. The violence we have witnessed in the last few weeks is not unlike the horrors coming out of Artsakh. The willingness to pick sides in a brutal conflict is beyond me. The awesome power of the United States must be used to negotiate a cease fire and support the victims and refugees of these horrendous wars, not provide weapons to authoritarian governments that we consider our allies.

Once the dust has settled and the injured are cared for and the dead have been buried, we must take a long, hard look how we, the wealthiest nation in the world, support imperialist occupation around the globe and recognize our role in those historic conflicts while working to undo the generational trauma it has caused.

instagram,"The amount of flat out incorrect or uselessly out of context information that is shared by people with night vision to people who are looking to get into night vision on the internet remains staggering. 

Opinions are opinions - they're worth what you pay for them, and everyone is entitled to one. What you then do with those opinions, in terms of how much they influence what you then pursue in terms of NV solutions, is the tricky part. 

The defining issue in the NV community today has to do with authoritative advice and sources, and being able to differentiate what sources are authoritative versus noise. 

Authoritative sources in the NV world will have experience both in terms of depth and breadth. Depth meaning significant time/repetitions in evaluating solutions or performance and breadth in terms of evaluating many devices, tube types, and in many varied use cases. Notice that this does not automatically make military or law enforcement authoritative sources (though a number of them are). For example, specific to advising new buyers, users who have lots of time using one device and tube type professionally may be of some help, but generally would not be an authoritative source on which of the many types of devices or tubes might be a good fit for a certain other user. 

On the flip side, nonprofessional enthusiast users have big limitations on how much they can realistically use night vision to build up a base of experience that is both broad and deep. It's not easy to just spend hours and hours out at night using this stuff all the time, and it's also not easy to be able to accurately compare tons of solutions side by side. But it is relatively easy to consume information online to then regurgitate as an enthusiast of something. 

We recommend professionals such as @mochabear_actual who have expanded on their professional use with their own testing and research, and especially those on this side of the industry who do not have the typical limitations on breadth of experience with NV. You need many perspectives to avoid conflict of interest, and ultimately you should be seeking firsthand experience more than secondhand.",,419,"{'like_count': 411, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 25394}",Nocturnality,,2023-10-20 18:47:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/67748136_2345118568868649_4161505426409521152_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=2acWy2iM-3AAX9G_ZFE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCr8KkCs7tZfijZttLgtQiyt1zCSEB-GM79Hud3xejV1A&oe=655AD27D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyoZgxzuHHm/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393541172_1331270544178784_8209482718705796411_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ukV1VrEYcacAX-G-x0B&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC5-Qyv_10MHnaEMCupOyvyYkBFop3KjUNF5cW708mNHg&oe=6559DE21

instagram,"Art is a portal. But only when you step into it with your heart. Art and Heart go together~ you see how they’re spelt. Creating is an act of inner love, expressing itself outwards from itself. The output might be the only visible part for everyone else, but it’s the entire inner world that creates it. To make art, you have to first learn to love, no? (Not asking rhetorically- pls do share your opinion!)
Sometimes the hardest part of making art is the part where you have to dive deep into your head- or heart- or soul?- deep enough to get to the right place to express purely, without anything but flow and expression. The time is takes to keep your mental state in a place of creative flow, is part of the art’work’ too.

Our inner world is our own natural world. And it’s our most precious place. 

If we’re lucky enough to have peace, to have the time to cultivate our inner world because all other factors are already in place -and that we won some luck in the birth lottery- then may this be sent out as a beacon of hope to those who dont have this luxury - alongside protests, and other support. 
Despite the horrors of the world happening, I will still share art. The more suffering in the world, the more that Art, music, poetry, and peace- has a place. My heart goes to all those in Gaza, caught in conflict, caught in the fight of other men, whose fights mean that others lose their lives, or that the living lose their peace. This horrific genocide shows our broken patriachal systems. May change come soon. And may the UK and US governments step up soon. 

I will not close my eyes to whats happening in Gaza. But also, i will not close my eyes to the beauty and peace that still exists in the world. There’s so much unbearable pain and so much unbelievable awe. Some photos of recent awe.

instagram,"Bayern Munich on Friday said defender Noussair Mazraoui would not be suspended, after a probe into the Moroccan player over his social media posts on the Israel-Hamas conflict.

In the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel, Mazraoui had put up several pro-Palestinian posts, including one that called for ""victory"" for ""our oppressed brothers in Palestine"".

Bayern said they held a ""detailed and clarifying conversation"" with the player due to his ""Instagram posts in connection with the terror against Israel almost two weeks ago which led to irritation and criticism"".

But the club's chief executive Jan-Christian Dreesen said Mazraoui ""credibly assured us he rejects terror and war"" and ""regrets if his posts caused irritation"".

In the statement issued by Bayern, the Morocco player was quoted saying: ""I condemn every kind of terrorism and every terrorist organisation.""

Mazraoui will remain with the squad but is currently ""out of action"" due to an injury he sustained on international duty with Morocco, the club said.

If you want to trigger strong feelings of attraction and adoration in your man, you have to know how to get on the same frequency with him.

Imagine never having to deal with his silent treatment again. (Which is just really code for “I’m angry but don’t want to talk about it”.)

When you know how to read him and know what he’s thinking and feeling, unpleasant situations like the silent treatment will be a thing of the past.

instagram,"On Oct. 19, #DOC Commissioner Louis A. Molina swore-in a new class of #CorrectionOfficer recruits at the @nypd Academy in College Point. The department’s ongoing partnership with the #NYPD will allow these new recruits to train at their state-of-the-art facility for 12 weeks.

“We are proud to welcome these new recruits to our Boldest family,” said Commissioner Molina. “This is just the beginning, but this is a major step forward in their careers, for this department, and for public safety in our city. We look forward to seeing these new recruits flourish in our training program.”

During the Correction Academy, recruits receive rigorous training from two dozen veteran DOC instructors in law, conflict resolution, de-escalation tactics, jail procedures, suicide prevention, physical conditioning, programming, firearms and report writing.

At the completion of their 12 weeks of training, the recruits will advance to facilities on Rikers Island for an 8-week field training program, where they will receive hands-on experience from veteran field training officers. This fully immersed training model is how the department is instilling proper correctional practices, improving training, and making its jails safer for our officers, staff, and people in custody.",,389,"{'like_count': 371, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 15899}",NYC Department of Correction,,2023-10-20 15:08:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/318142020_881199249552134_3109741406108253695_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=C-ZnQqLidZ0AX_B-17z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCV6e3dv6OoEbIHZCNybaMMa-t23QAak1zRsVNQxCOPug&oe=655B5B47,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyoAeCVgsxF/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393457810_1059770928373200_5858009179103882435_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ODhvXk2izDQAX-9wsfl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAJ4ujAhR4MbEi1ciVDbsJmz0pjkx4WDXFORw5OIc5F6A&oe=6546BE93

instagram,"I am reaching out to you with a heartfelt plea for help. Our beloved family, is currently trapped in war-torn Sudan, facing a dire situation that requires immediate action.

Not only has my family been caught in the crossfire of a brutal conflict, but they recently experienced a devastating attack on the city Al-ailafoun where they were seeking shelter. Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) stormed the area, causing widespread destruction and tragically taking the life of a family member. During this horrifying event, my sick cousins life was also put in jeopardy, as one of the armed assailants held a gun to their head.

Their life is not only threatened by the violence surrounding them but also by a debilitating neurological disease that has left my cousin in desperate need of medical attention. The lack of resources in Sudan has made it nearly impossible for them to receive the necessary treatment, worsening their condition day by day.

Time is of the essence, as the routes out of Sudan are rapidly closing, leaving them with limited options for escape. We are urgently seeking donations to cover the costs of their evacuation and provide my cousin with the medical care she so desperately needs

Our immediate financial needs include funds for visas, flight tickets via Port Sudan, travel expenses from Madani to Port Sudan, and the essential medications required for my cousins neurological condition. Every little contribution will go a long way in helping secure their safety and access the medical attention they urgently require.

We understand that times are tough, and the world is facing numerous challenges. However, we firmly believe in the power of compassion and the collective strength of a caring community. By donating, no matter the amount, you can make a significant difference in their life and bring hope to our family during this difficult time.

Additionally, we kindly ask you to help spread the message far and wide. Share this appeal with your friends, family, and acquaintances, encouraging them to join us in our mission to bring our family to safety. Thank you.

instagram,"A relationship means two sets of unconscious worlds colliding. History. Triggers. Unmet needs. Unconscious rules about how connections work.⁣

There is going to be some conflict!

HOW we navigate those moments makes a huge difference to how happy & emotionally safe we feel in the relationship long-term. 

A lot of damage can be done in those moments of rupture. But a lot of healing can happen too.

If you learn how to understand what’s going on in a new way, & develop ways of listening & speaking that foster connection instead of distance, those hard moments will become transformative.

Of course, it’s not all on you. There are two people in the relationship. But as ever we can’t control other people or make them change or reflect….

But we CAN have a massive impact of the trajectory of the dynamics we participate in. You are a powerful part of your relationships. The learning you do & the changes you make will make a difference.

💡 The Healthy Relationships Roadmap will give you the tools to better navigate your relationship. 

Module 1: Connect the dots between your childhood relationships & your relationships now

Module 2: Awareness. Learn how you show up in relationships & why. Get clear on your relationship patterns.

Module 3: Making changes: communication, better dynamics, boundaries, codependency, healthy conflict.

Module 4: Healing your relationship with yourself. Reparenting, inner child work, self-regulation.

Module 5: Healthy family relationships. Create an interdependent home environment & have healthy relationships with your children & partners.

Module 6: Develop a personalised blueprint to help you keep up the relationship awareness & habits you’ve formed

instagram,"The thing with cults, whether they be of religion, secret societies, or clandestine organizations, is that there is always a paper trail of mutual acquaintances and too many social patterns of coincidences to ignore. Sure, there's always the off chance you met a celebrity and posed for a random photo op. But after a while, you begin to see flickers of shadows of the real players controlling the pawns from behind the scenes.

One would think dual citizenship for any politician would be a conflict of interest for holding a position of political office. However, that is exactly what we have in America with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 

Granted, sure, maybe Ghislaine Maxwell's dad, Robert Maxwell, wasn't a spy for Israeli Mossad, and it was just a total coincidence that he bought up multi media outlets for the hell of it with no alterior motive to manipulate American education and magazine consumption. 
Perhaps Antony Blinken's dad Donald Blinken just was coincidentally and conveniently around at the time to be Robert Maxwell's lawyer representative.

Sure, Maxwell just slipped off his yacht and died in a freak accident. 

Certainly, the Mother Teresa connection couldn't possibly be true that her charities were frozen for child trafficking allegations. The documentary about Mother Teresa, ""The Devil's Angel"" released in 1997, couldn't possibly condemn such a ""saint"" as dubbed by the Catholic church. (citizens of India were furious about this in news comment sections when this title was presented to her).

I'm sure Albert Pike's vision for WW3 between the Islamic states and Israel was a hoax prophecy, and Ben Netayahu's New Middle East map (that didn't include Palestine) unveiled at the UN National Assembly on Sept. 23nd 2023 was just a coincidence. That within 14 days of this map being shown, the Iron Dome magically malfunctioned, and Israel went from retaliation strikes to full-on genocidal land grab overnight. Gaza's population of 2.2 million people, 1 million are kids under 15 years of age. I'm sure they're all radical extremists. 😵‍💫

instagram,"At a rally Thursday evening across the street from General Dynamics Mission Systems organized by Berkshire Communists, roughly 100 people said it was time for “jobs and education, not war and occupation.” 

That was one of a number of chants at the group's “Call for Anti-Imperialist Action” demonstration in which it protested the escalating war in Israel, particularly Israel’s bombing of Gaza following attacks by Hamas — and the taking of an estimated minimum of 200 hostages — that left Israel and the world reeling.

Activists aimed their wrath at the second largest employer in the Berkshires and its business of developing technology to support the U.S. Navy, which the demonstrators say are used to harm and oppress people — including Palestinians.

Habibullah, 72, has lost two sons, a daughter, and two nephews. He stands near graves that had been dug in anticipation of more deads arriving from other villages.
Younes and Sayed, two cousins, are still finishing to make the graves of their loved ones, including Younes’ parents, and Said’s parents and four siblings.
Hawa has also lost three aunts. 
No home still stands, and it’s getting cold. It’s hard to imagine how hard the future will be for those families who face not only the incommensurable pain but also who lost homes, and all they had, when they already had so little.
Like most of Zendajan district, the community of Seyad Aab village was already after decades of conflict and repetitive droughts. 
The village is one of the worst hit but not an exception, thousands havdied across several districts of Herat Province this month in the many earthquakes that hit in the span of now almost two weeks, and the loved ones who survived are left with nothing. Earthquakes continue. Dozens of thousands of people have been directly affected in Herat province and many more need support. 
Although it wasn’t hit like the districts, in Herat city, people were sleeping in tents for fear another earthquakes would make their homes fall. Hospitals are overwhelmed. Humanitarian aid insufficient while thousands have no more home and the winter cold is settling.

instagram,"Tw: gen0c!de

Being part of a community in an earlier stage of gen0c!de (i.e. one which does not yet involve mass m*rder) has given me a different perspective on what’s happening in Gaza right now. No person should lose their life to violence period, but especially not because of the community they’re part of.

Unfollow if you want, I really don’t care. I’m not here to debate the politics of the Palestine-Israel conflict, but it’s necessary to talk about how violence against Palestine has turned into a gen0c!dal humanitarian crisis.

[Accessibility: I am a transgender, Indigenous, American medical trainee. It’s horrifying to me that civilians are losing their lives and it all boils down to gen0c!de. The American trans community and Palestine are in very different stages of gen0c!de, with Palestine in immediate crisis, but we are both watching the eradication of our communities. I can’t stand behind the mass m*rder of civilians, no matter who they are or where they come from. Palestinian and Israeli alike - neither group of human beings deserves death.

instagram,"As the Israel-Hamas war escalates, its effects are being felt around the world, including in the Twin Cities’ Palestinian and Jewish communities.

Several Palestinian and Jewish community members who spoke to Sahan Journal expressed diverse opinions on the long-standing conflict, but shared a common feeling—fear for family members who live in or near the combat zones in the Gaza Strip and Israel.

Despite the hum of worry that now runs through their daily lives, some community members expressed empathy for each other, and hope that the local communities could work towards understanding.

instagram,"This series of pics (swipe to see them all) needs some explanation, so I highly recommend reading today’s caption. Let’s just say there’s a #6degreesofkevinbacon vibe, minus the @kevinbacon #iykyk.

As you know, I decided to keep the #halloweencostume parade going in hopes to bring some light into the darkness (check out my previous posts). It’s been challenging w/recent events, both worldly & personally, as well as having promised myself to only use items I already own. Thankfully, I have yet to exhaust my hubby’s #horrormovie & memorabilia collection.

For the last couple years, I’ve wanted to do a costume w/these furry, flesh-eating #aliens, but I didn’t know who I would pair w/them. Although the #Critters movie franchise is so recognizable, it’s surprising how many people haven’t actually seen the movies. Even if I dress like someone from the films, it’s unlikely you’d know who I was.

I guess I could’ve been one of the bounty hunters, especially because they can take on the form of whoever they see. Otherwise, it’s just the average family/neighbors in a small rural community.

Did you know that @leonardodicaprio was one of those average everyday kids in a Crittters movie? It’s not his best work, but we all have to start somewhere.

So, back to the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon inspiration, I thought I’d do the same thing w/ #LeonardoDicaprio & dress as someone recognizable from one of his other flicks.

Since my daughter is reading #Shakespeare’s #RomeoandJuliet this year in her English class, I opted to dress as @clairedanes in #the90s @bazluhrmann movie version. I simply pulled out my old wedding dress, yet again, pairing it w/ #angelwings like the ones Juliet wears at the #costumeparty where she meets Romeo.

Romeo & Juliet fall in love (or infatuation) at first sight, despite their names. Their families were in conflict, but that didn’t make them feel less for one another.

As Juliet says, “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose. By any other word would smell as sweet.”

Just like these Critters. I’d most likely stay away from the ones in the movie, but these are quite friendly.

Don’t be so quick to judge people. Lead w/love ❤️",,356,"{'like_count': 180, 'comment_count': 176, 'num_users': 11246}",Shannonmarie,,2023-10-20 17:58:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/41803251_1412311055579229_6425949460605435904_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KYVuQL8RMPEAX8NBMKF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBVHxuypawTrKt2e7jgC0MD2rXtRzU0dhEhQnScEqhi-A&oe=655A3663,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyoT0pILpuZ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394266149_671227021820555_6886636321366954571_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Huu-IDutXBYAX_W8U3s&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAwPXe00q6p2v7jVhcfQqf1cCfxcipfi34_cuYrmno9Qg&oe=655950D7

instagram,"Gaza in history: Gaza is no stranger to territorial conflict. 

Originally settled around 3000 bc as a fortress and trading post between Egypt and Canaan, the city of Gaza declined and was rebuilt several times during the Bronze Age. After serving as an administrative centre in ancient Egypt, it became one of five ports used by the Philistines. The Gaza Strip, incorporating a 25-mile stretch of coastline between Gaza City and Egypt, came into existence only after 1948 when the area was under Egyptian control.

Other political entities which have had control of Gaza over the centuries include: the Assyrian Empire, the Kingdom of Macedon, the Bedouins, the Seleucid Dynasty, the Nabataeans, the Roman Empire, Judea, the Fatimid caliphate, the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire.

instagram,"China’s special envoy for the Mideast pinned the cause of the Israel-Gaza crisis on the lack of guarantee for the rights of Palestinians, as he met with his Russian counterpart in Qatar, according to Reuters.

In the first leg of his tour in the region, China’s envoy for Middle East issues Zhai Jun landed in Qatar where he reaffirmed with his Russian counterpart Mikhail Bogdanov Beijing’s alignment with Moscow in their efforts to help de-escalate the situation in Gaza.

“The fundamental reason for the current situation in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is that the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people have not been guaranteed,” Zhai said.

instagram,"For all of us who have a connection to Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, indeed all of us who have hearts, the … what shall we even call it?.... War? Conflict? Genocide? Pain? Agony? in Palestine/Israel is heart-wrenching. Our hearts are torn open, broken and breaking.

75 years of Palestinian dispossession and ethnic cleansing
40+ years of Occupation
Hamas’ Murder of 1400 Jews, and reigniting of a collective Jewish trauma
Hamas holding hostage of 200 Israelis,
Israel’s Murder of 1500 Palestinian babies
Israel’s Murder of thousands of Palestinian civilians, and the deepening of a trauma that has been ongoing for decades
Israel’s displacement of over a million Palestinians, human beings, in Gaza, “the world’s largest open-air prison,” and denying them food, water, electricity, and medical supplies. 

Where is the heart?
Where is humanity?
What does love have to say in a time like this?
How do we pray when the heart is not at peace?

Here is what I would love to do: to invite all of you to a gathering this Saturday October 21st, at 3 pm EST (different than our usual gathering), to share a conversation and reflect on how to hold two truths together: First, that each and every single life is sacred, each and every single life is precious, and each and every single life contains the breath of God; that it includes Jewish lives and Palestinian lives. 

And second, that the “conflict” in Palestine/Israel is not, and has not been, a “fight”, a “war”, or a “struggle.” There is a context, and the unavoidable context recognized by every significant human rights organization is simple: an illegal and immoral Occupation. No human being would ever willingly choose to live under the dehumanizing condition that Palestinians have been forced to live under for decades. 

Join us on Saturday at 3 pm EST for a conversation with a commitment both to dignity of every single life, and a concurrent commitment to upholding justice in a deeply unjust context. 

The session on Saturday October 21st, 3 pm EST. If you are interested in taking part, DM me directly. 

We will hold a conversation, followed by a small group conversation, and end with invoking Divine Names.",,296,"{'like_count': 284, 'comment_count': 12, 'num_users': 8228}",Omid Safi,,2023-10-20 14:59:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/382264108_330912469451141_556980107312462118_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Tnu0JjEPeJEAX8Xc3dm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD0E5_0W5qEPZ-uIbURXzEvSoQksyTg6cTqSgYgiDGk1Q&oe=655B44CD,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyn_YJ-Ay8L/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393700694_349788287608108_6580644531311228242_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=odnlxMO92swAX_a-0qv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD-qjdHuNWPMg8_Idxjhxn79jXtPV2YlVYz-YIFgX9TRg&oe=654BDCB9

instagram,"The Cauvery River, which flows through the southern Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and the Union territory of Puducherry, has been a source of persistent and intricate water conflict. The dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the Cauvery River is traced back to as early as 1890, with roots in the pre-independence era when the then princely states of Mysore (now Karnataka) and Madras (now Tamil Nadu) contended for control over the river’s waters. Even after independence, the issue has persisted, revolving around the judicious sharing and utilisation of water resources, and has resulted in numerous legal battles, protests, and political maneuvering.

The tussle between the lower riparian state of Tamil Nadu, with a share of 404.25 tmc (thousand million cubic feet) annually, and the upper riparian state of Karnataka, which has a share of 284.75 tmc, has aggravated today due to the failure of southwest monsoons in Karnataka this season. Judicial and quasi-judicial bodies formed to resolve the issues over the years have failed. Despite these efforts, a lasting resolution still needs to be achieved, with both states continually vying for their rightful share of the river’s water.

This article focuses on the key findings from research that must guide the dispute resolution mechanisms. It is high time to advocate not for the rightful share of water for each state but the reasonable share in water conservation mechanisms by both states given the climate crises.

As per the Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase, if there are low transaction costs and clear property rights, the two states could engage in voluntary negotiations to efficiently allocate the river water. However, the historical complexities of the dispute, high transaction costs, and political factors do not allow efficient bargaining.

instagram,"Beautiful piece of artwork by @myrahome.uk who’s parents left their homeland because of conflict in the 80s. They have roots in Palestine + are donating funds from this to the children of Gaza. 

I have a few things we need to post about the weekend, not related to the current atrocities happening right now. 
SO, before I move on with that I needed to post this. 

I condemn the Israeli government in their military attack against the people of Palestine and call for immediate ceasefire. 

Nor do I support viewing these actions as justified defence. 
I do not support the UK + US gov in co-signing this.

I support Jewish people in their desire for a homeland+understand they have roots in this region that go back millennia. I hope we can find a way for a Jewish homeland to exist while also freeing the people of Palestine (one state solution?)

I condemn antisemitism + am open to discourse from all sides on what constitutes as this. 

I condemn Hammas for murdering Israeli people.

I don’t equate Hammas with Palestinian people.
I condemn Islamophobia + don't equate Islam with terrorism.

I don't support the narrative that it was an unprovoked attack:

I condemn the Israeli government for the decades of oppression of Palestinian people, which has developed into apartheid and now horrific genocide. This conflict did not start this week in a void, there has been much suffering+bloodshed for a LONG time for the Palestinian people under the hand of the Israeli government. It is only now hitting our white supremicist Western media, who report with double standards, ignoring when the violence is against Palestinian people + only showing up for the violence against Israel.

I don’t equate the state of Israel + the Israeli gov with Israeli people (just as I am a separate to what the UK gov decides to do)

I condemn what is happening to Palestinian people as genocide and it must be stopped. 

I thank @grillodesigns on her continued compilation of resources + action points which have really helped me organise my thoughts around this. Please check her signposting/highlight/stories.

ما يحصل هو #قتل_للمدينة. تعود جذور مصطلح Urbicide إلى الكلمة اللاتينية urbs التي تعني المدينة وoccido التي تعني الإبادة. وهو بالتالي القتل المتعمد للمدينة، مع سابق إصرار وترصد، ويشمل التدمير المنهجي والمتعمد والعنف المنظم ضد البيئات الحضرية. ويلعب «قتل المدينة» دوراً أساسياً في الحرب، إذ يكوّن جزءاً من تدمير الذاكرة الجماعية والمكان المُعاش والانتماء، بالإضافة إلى القتل المباشر للناس.

What is happening in Gaza is neither a conflict, nor a clash, nor a crisis. We should use the right terminology. 
What is happening is #Urbicide, which as a term literally translates to “city-killing.” The term has its roots in the Latin word “urbs,” meaning “city,” and “occido,” meaning “to massacre.” Urbicide is the deliberate murder of a city, premeditated and ordered. It involves the systematic and intentional destruction and organized violence against urban environments. Urbicide forms an important war tool, as it is a way to destroy collective memory, the lived space, and belonging, in addition to the direct killing of people.

instagram,"“a failure of imagination”

I wrote these words months ago, not in response to anything happening in the world—but they mean something particular now.

I am convinced that the greatest accelerant to the conflict between Israel and Palestine is NOT ancient but modern: the most powerful, influential people in the world believe “it has to be this way.” It’s not that we overtly cheer when we see graphic images of slaughtered children. But if you bet on say the Celtics, then you “need” the Celtics to win. 

Christians in the west, who hold more sway than anyone as to how the world is actually shaped (despite all our protests to the contrary), are largely convinced that terror is an unfortunate but necessary part of the “script.”

We are told that the children of Abraham must be at war with each other—which isn’t true. Isaac and Ishmael came together in peace when their father Abraham died, as I remember my beloved Sister Margaret Gaines showing me when she was still on this side of the veil. She considered herself no political radical, but she spent her life both immersed in the stories of Scripture and the stories of her neighbors in the Palestinian village of Aboud. 

It was also Sister Margaret that wrote that the suffering she saw in the land was “man’s idea not God’s” and the product of “the meddlesome zealotry of the church” attempting to force the end “before the time.” 

I don’t believe that the stark images of Revelation give us an inevitable script for the end of the days. Misreading ancient texts is shockingly dangerous for our neighbors, and for ourselves. Contrary to popular opinion, the story of Scripture concludes by showing us how Love ultimately will overcome through self-sacrifice (I.e. the cross embraced by the lamb of God “loving not their own lives even unto death”). Spoiler alert: it’s not loving to wish war for your neighbors, to hasten your own cosmic salvation.

Christians coming out of the mass Ponzi scheme of toxic eschatology will make no small difference in the world. “Blessed are the peacemakers,” Jesus said. 

How tragic that many who claim to follow him are the greatest obstacle to peacemaking and, thus to peace, in our time.",,276,"{'like_count': 260, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 15126}",Jonathan Martin,,2023-10-20 23:15:50,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/330266048_784283773033090_8441809441462594376_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=mRDOFScwixYAX8nRD8V&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDXuPfJnlLTeDX8MrUZ52fxpm5gFbNRBsK6jFMvh8hdSA&oe=655A59CA,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyo4MZyPdBx/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393573835_814927297098217_4176504191315389527_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=YmbbD0jZBvAAX82Zol2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDjl-yKYrfZsMiGqqm1BT4_QdQllF5WSAY-jDs5AQzffw&oe=655A5EAC

◼️ Astfel, costumele inspirate din Barbie, Wednesday Addams și supereroi din filme sunt interzise, deoarece purtarea unor astfel de costume ar promova conținutul realizat de studiourile cu care actorii sunt în conflict.
◼️ Greva actorilor a durat aproape 100 de zile, promovând probleme legate de creșterea salariilor, împărțirea veniturilor din streaming și protejarea imaginii și vocii actorilor de replicarea prin inteligență artificială.

instagram,"On Thursday, I had my first chance to look across into Gaza from a vantage point in Israel. The view between the trees framed a mosque and minaret which, a few moments later, were surrounded by clouds of dust and smoke from an incoming strike. Minutes later, a column of smoke rose into the air from another. I hadn't picked a specific time of day to visit, and I was there for only twenty minutes before being forced to move due to outgoing rockets overhead but in those few moments, the regularity of the incoming shelling gave just the smallest glimpse into the hell that the population is going through within the border walls. I nearly made reference to ""sides"", but the suffering of innocent civilians is tragically universal.

William Sampson  Jordan was born in the state of Kentucky more than 195 years ago on January 7th, 1828 to his father Thomas and mother, Mary Jordan.

We know that he served in the military during the American Civil War. Whether he fought for the Union or (C)ondederacy is up for debate with mixed documentation / claims for both. Soldiers from Kentucky fought for both sides during the historic conflict. It's also possible that he ventured to the South and served in the Volunteer State of Tennessee. (A widows pension filed after his death offered no specifics whatsoever.)

At the age of 61, William Sampson married New Hampshire native, newly transplanted Florida resident,  mother of one, and the recently widowed, 45 year old, Henrietta ""Etta"" Duncklee Wade in Hernando County on September 10th, 1889. (We were unable to locate any previous marriages or children connected with tonight's subject.) It is unclear as to when and why Mr. Jordan relocated to the Sunshine State.

This evening's honoree supported his family as a grocery store merchant.

Regrettably, William Sampson would lose his life from the effects of  indigestion complications in conjunction with ""senility"" on April 7th, 1917. He was eighty nine.

•• Surprisingly, according to William Sampson's death certificate Henrietta did not now much about his early life. This coincides with her lack of knowledge about his military service on her widows pension request Additionally, when ""Etta"" passed away in 1928 she was buried beside her first husband, Albert T. Wade who died in 1884 in an entirely different cemetery.

●● Imagine the incredible changes  he witessed firsthand in the form of history, technology, politics, and societal shifts !!

instagram,"As Chicago’s Palestinian community mourned the loss of a 6-year-old boy who was stabbed 26 times by his landlord in a suspected hate crime fueled by the Israel-Hamas war, a group of rabbis attended the funeral to express their hope for peace.

Rabbi Ari Hart was one of several local Jewish leaders who came out to show their support for the family of Wadea Al-Fayoume, the Palestinian-American who was allegedly attacked with a 12-inch military-style knife by landlord Joseph Czuba, 71, as he shouted, “You Muslims must die!”

Hart said it was his duty to attend the funeral and help comfort the mourners as a means to condemn the bloody murder and advocate for peace.

“We met with the Imam [muslim religious leader], heard from the father, and stood with the boy’s community as they mourned this horrific loss,” Hart wrote in a Facebook post. “We witnessed the pain.

“We expressed our shock and condemnation of the attack. We wept,” he added.

Hart admitted that it was not easy for the group of rabbis to attend the funeral given the on-going conflict between Israel and Hamas, with Gaza resembling a war zone following unprecedented violence between Palestinians and Jews.

“But the murder of a six year old because of his faith and his identity is not complicated. It is a heinous crime. And that’s why we went today,” Hart explained.

Despite the current divisions between their communities, Hart said he hoped the rabbis’ attendance could serve as a reminder that peace is not out of reach for Jews and Palestinians.

“I can’t give up on trying, yearning, dreaming, even right now, of finding the way to shalom,” he wrote. “The way to salaam. The way to peace.”

The rabbis’ visit served as hope amid heartbreak for those in attendance of the boy’s funeral, with father Oday El-Fayoume still in shock over the fate that befell his son and ex-wife, Hanaan Shahin, was stabbed more than a dozen times and remains in the hospital.",,239,"{'like_count': 239, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 13354}",muslimjewishbrotherhood,,2023-10-20 07:38:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/384983331_1060310614974054_1458891557923464658_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SRPyzfV-N-wAX-a9Bik&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAizNgD51xG3CpznHruOY1zeBbxiz5dGNhPvmd8z9r7tw&oe=655B1481,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynM8UsNDdY/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393975183_1449451938937925_3864058068806297413_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=B1msIU_kKf8AX9auWN4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA8IS0_ymT1s4iMbL40ngEYhDcXyBTuwqHNVBQff4QVNA&oe=653ECA12

instagram,"Via NPR: A State Department official has resigned from the bureau that oversees arms transfers to foreign nations, citing his objection to continued U.S. military assistance to Israel as its retaliatory bombardment and blockade of Gaza exacerbate a humanitarian crisis there.

Josh Paul was the director of congressional and public affairs at the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. In a two-page letter posted on LinkedIn, he said he had made a promise to himself when he joined over a decade ago that he would stay “as long as I felt the harm I might do could be outweighed by the good I could do.”

“I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued — indeed, expanded and expedited — provision of lethal arms to Israel — I have reached the end of that bargain,” he wrote.

Paul tendered his resignation on Wednesday, the same day that President Biden visited Israel in a public show of support. The president pledged his commitment to its security and promised a congressional request for more defense funding, even as he urged Israelis not to be consumed by their rage and directed $100 million in humanitarian aid for Palestinians.

Paul wrote in his letter that he was heartened to see the administration’s efforts to temper Israel’s response, including its advocacy for the provision of relief, supplies and safe passage for civilians in Gaza.

But he said he could not work in support of a set of major policy decisions — including “rushing more arms to one side of the conflict” — that he believes to be “shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse.”

The State Department declined to comment on personnel matters.

Paul said the first thing he’d like the Biden administration to do is “simply follow their own public commitments.”

Given the terrible events of the past two weeks in Israel and Palestine, our thoughts are with all those who continue to suffer from this enduring conflict.

Scottish football is a positive and cohesive force for good in the communities that surround and sustain our clubs. We will therefore be supporting the @britishredcross, who have launched an emergency appeal to support the international response efforts aiding those in urgent need and will be promoting this appeal through social media this weekend.

Supreme Court lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai, who provided 'evidence' to BJP MP Nishikant Dubey against Moitra, told the Delhi High Court that senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the Trinamool leader, had approached him to drop the CBI complaint against her.

“The senior advocate called me yesterday and asked me to withdraw the CBI complaint in exchange for the return of the dog,"" said Dehadrai who is Mahua Moitra's estranged partner.

Moitra and Dehadrai have been fighting over their pet Rottweiler, Henry. In the last six months, the Trinamool MP has filed multiple police complaints against Dehadrai for alleged criminal trespass, theft, vulgar messages and abuse, news agency PTI reported, quoting Trinamool sources.

instagram,"Hi guys, I’m here to state what I thought was the obvious ❤️‍🩹 but the silence in the UK is disgusting. The government is being outrageous.

Bombing a hospital is not okay. Babies being killed everyday is not okay. The disgustingly obvious propaganda in the news by a government with an unimaginable budget is not okay. 

Please know I have been working hard to educate myself these past few days about a ‘conflict’ that goes far far beyond what happened on the 7th October. I still don’t know the full history. I sometimes read the newspaper on the tube to work to kill time but I’m not a ‘news girly’ at all. I find any life lost 🇮🇱 🇵🇸 to be horrible. Relatable? 🖐️ BUT I’ve HAD to put SOMETHING out there as the recent incidents have DEEPLY disturbed me. I’m hoping this encourages so so many of us who are silent to start speaking out.

I have seen there are so many ‘buts’ ‘what ifs’ being thrown around social media. There are so many people staying silent because ‘I don’t know the history’ or ‘it doesn’t concern me’. There’s so much silence because you don’t want to be the person that says the ‘wrong thing’ BUT recent events have been too INHUMANE to ignore and far too commonsensical not to condemn. 

This is not about religion. This is not about who dunnit. There is far too much history, western and Middle Eastern politics and propaganda for many of us to understand in a single social media post. 

The bottom line is one of the worlds most advanced military powers is ‘defending itself’ 🤮 by (in their own words) flattening out a STRIP of land where millions live. Half of which are kids. They’ve lost their childhood, innocence and probably their minds by now watching bomb after bomb drop down on their heads. Please speak up. Please show up to the protest this Saturday at Marble Arch. Please write to your local MP (last slide). Please educate yourself, there are a lot of academic resources (not TikTok) available. Please recognise Jewish and Muslim communities are very frightened worldwide about what this means for them (the recent example of a 6 year old Muslim boy murdered by his landlord in America).

Help us in praying that, even in the midst of the conflict, the soldiers, the civilians, the friends & families of those either killed or taken hostage, and also the leaders of Israel, will experience the rest that only comes from Adonai.​

instagram,"I was wondering when someone in the administration would have the #PoliticalCourage to stand on their #Integrity #Morals and #Values

Thank you for your service and humanity, Josh Paul.

🔁 @washingtonpost 

A State Department official who worked on arms transfers to foreign powers resigned Wednesday over the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, declaring he could not support further U.S. military assistance to Israel and calling the administration’s response “an impulsive reaction” based on “intellectual bankruptcy.”

The official, Josh Paul, was director of congressional and public affairs at the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, which handles arms transfers. His departure marks a rare measure of internal discomfort over the administration’s robust support for Israel, the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East. 

More broadly, it was an unusual public show of dissent within President Biden’s foreign policy apparatus, which has worked to prevent such expressions of frustration from spilling over into view.

instagram,"I’ve long told myself that if I lived through nazi Germany, the civil rights movement, or South African apartheid I wouldn’t have been able to stay silent about the dehumanization of entire populations of people. Sadly, I see a lot of people saying nothing through THIS apartheid and it’s become apparent the lack of humanity and overwhelming indifference a lot of those I considered friends have shown. How are people still silent? This is happening in real time and we are witnessing it all through our phones, yet some still turn a blind eye. No longer can we say “we didn’t know.” 

As artists and cultural producers, our work has the power to shape public opinion. Today, as the media wages a war against truth and strips this conflict of its historical context, we have a unique responsibility to use our voice and artistic practices to say NO MORE! Now is the time to protest apartheid and amplify the just cause of the Palestinian people and their resistance against 75 years of occupation.

instagram,"U.S. President Joe Biden says he believes the first trucks carrying aid to Gaza would come through the Rafah crossing from Egypt within the next two days. ⁠
⁠
Israel continued to pummel the Gaza Strip overnight with airstrikes, amid warnings that Israeli forces could invade the Hamas-ruled territory at any time. ⁠
⁠
The Israel Defense Forces posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: “During the night, fighter jets attacked over a hundred operational targets of the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, destroying tunnel shafts, munitions warehouses and dozens of operational headquarters.” ⁠
⁠
Meanwhile, Israel is planning to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona. Authorities said Friday that the town’s residents will be placed in state-funded guest houses. The northern city is located near Israel’s border with Lebanon and has been subjected to numerous rocket and missile attacks from Palestinian militant groups. ⁠
⁠
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak travels Friday to Egypt, his latest Middle Eastern destination, as the conflict continues to grow. Sunak has already met with Israeli leaders and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ⁠

It’s been a crazy few days settling in to life living in a hospital as I support my partner through some serious surgery. He is doing really well and hopefully through the worst of it now.

I also find myself thinking about this country’s recent immigration policy, when the entire world is represented here working together saving lives, it is an obscenity to even debate.

instagram,"ON POLICE 

📌 WHAT: Manipur will set up a Women’s Police Battalion to help improve gender equality in the police force.

🚨 SAYS WHO: CM Biren Singh during the 132nd Manipur Police Raising Day celebrations in Imphal. 

▪️FYI: No timelines announced for this new battalion.

👉🏼 ON THE RECORD

🎙️ ON POLICE: “There are no personnel or officers in the state police who have not taken extra duty in the past five months.”

🎙️ Singh also said that people won’t forget the role police played to move affected families to relief camps during the initial days of the ethnic conflict in Manipur, which started on May 3.

🎙️ ON LAW AND ORDER: “When we enter the state force or services, we should consider everyone as Indians or Manipuris. One may be a Meitei, Pangal, Kuki or a Naga but once we don the police uniform, we should consider everyone to be the same and the priority should be to maintain law and order and protect lives and property.”

📌 ICYMI: Several members of the Kuki community have claimed the Manipur police allegedly did not protect them and sometimes even joined Meitei mobs attacking them. The Director General of Police (DGP) of Manipur denied these allegations.

instagram,"Did you know that a living trust can provide you and your family with peace of mind and protection for your assets?

Setting up a living trust allows you to retain control over your property while also ensuring that it is distributed according to your wishes after you pass away.

Without a living trust, your assets may be subject to probate, which can be a lengthy and costly process for your loved ones to navigate.

By creating a living trust, you can avoid probate and reduce the potential for conflict among your beneficiaries.

You can also protect your assets from creditors and minimize the tax burden on your estate.

Additionally, a living trust allows you to name a trustee to manage your affairs if you become incapacitated.

Don't leave your legacy to chance - take control of your future by setting up a living trust today.

Your loved ones will thank you for it.

@mun_missuniversenepal : 
The Path to Peace: Presenting Asian Paints Miss Universe Nepal 2023 National Costume ✨ 

A world flawed by conflict often leads us to confine the dove, symbolizing peace, within a cage. However, it is high time we free the essence of peace and contain the destructive power of missiles instead. 

We are translating this powerful concept into an artistic costume, aiming to convey a profound message of peace, a sentiment deeply ingrained in Nepal's identity as a peace-loving nation. Nepal represents peace through its longstanding commitment to non-violence, its peaceful coexistence with diverse cultures, and its status as a neutral and harmonious nation. 

The costume is meticulously designed in colors that resonate with the choices of peace advocates, symbolizing their unwavering commitment to the cause of peace. ☮️

instagram,"Sri Lankan lawmakers express mixed views on Israel-Palestine conflict

Sri Lankan Parliament today called for a ceasefire in Gaza and called for a peaceful solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa who was speaking during the debate on the Israel-Palestine conflict said one road in Palestine is named after his father former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. “We cannot condone violence unleashed by both sides involved in the conflict. What is needed is a peaceful situation,” he said.

Former President Maithirpala Sirisena said his party SLFP would continue with its traditional pro-Palestine line. “We will stick to our traditional line but would stress for a peaceful solution to the conflict,” he said.

However MP Sarth Weerasekera who compared the situation in the Middle East with the civil in Sri Lanka said the two situations are different. “There are no similarities between the Gaza conflict and the Sri Lankan civil war. It is ironical to see members of the Tamil Diaspora who opposed Sri Lankan government for confronting LTTE backing Israel who is engaged in killing innocent people. There should be a peaceful solution to the Gaza issue,” he said.

Tamil National People’s Front MP Gajendra Kumar Ponnambalam held an opposite view and said Sri Lankan government did the same thing in the North and the East which Israel is doing in Gaza today. “Hospitals in the North were bombed during the Sri Lankan civil war just like what is done today in Gaza by Israel.

MP Rauff Hakeem questioned as to whether the Sri Lankan government is afraid of Israel. “Who told Israel that genocide is justifiable just because a terror group attacked its people. I wonder whether the Sri Lankan government is afraid of Israel.""

JJB MP Vijitha Herath said what is needed is a universal call for a ceasefire in Gaza. “This is not a time to find out who is right and who is wrong. What is needed is an amicable solution to the Israel and Palestine conflict. Nations such as USA should realize this situation and push for a peaceful solution,” he said.

10 stolen childhoods, 10 years of searching and reuniting
by AJAR and the Working Group on Timor-Leste’s Stolen Children

Timor-Leste’s Truth Commission (CAVR) released a finding that thousands of children were taken, without consent, by Indonesian soldiers and institutions during the 1975-1999 conflict. In its 2005 Final Report, the Commission stated that “the widespread practice of removing children displayed a mindset that by taking control of Timor-Leste’s territory, Indonesia also gained unfettered control over its children. ABRI (Indonesian military) members and other individuals with power in Timor-Leste felt that they were entitled to take an East Timorese child home without their parents’ permission.” 

For the past ten years Asia Justice and Rights (AJAR) and a working group for these “stolen children” began its work to search for survivors, now adults living in Indonesia. 

To date, 171 survivors have been traced and 96 of them reunited with their families in Timor-Leste, with support from Indonesia’s National Human Rights Commission and Timor-Leste’s Centro Nacional Chega. 

Although hundreds have been traced, these efforts have only scratched the surface. Survivors and their families need long-term support to mend their broken lives. Their stories speak about a constant longing, through dark days of separation and uncertainty, and continue even after reunions, as each side resumes lives in different countries.

Some of the material for this photo-book came out of a series of workshops held by AJAR and the Stolen Children Working Group, in cooperation with Centro Nacional Chega and the Australian National University in July 2023.

Most of the photographs were taken during the family reunions which took place between 2015-2019 by members of the Labarik Lakon Working Group.

instagram,"Have you ever expressed how you feel to your partner in response to something that hurt you? Only to have them respond with invalidation, defensiveness, or criticism? 

🪩 It’s a toxic pattern in your relationship. This can end in your feelings not being heard. You both become stuck in a cycle that disconnects. 

🪩 Hear this. In a healthy relationship, your partner will listen to how you feel, take in what’s needed, and work with you to try to not continue the pattern that hurt you in the first place.

🪩 Everyone deserves to be heard. No one deserves to have to fight or beg to be understood how you feel. Your feelings are your feelings. Honoring them is important.

Therapy can help your relationship learn to break unhealthy or toxic cycles, be heard, and understood.

instagram,"THIS IS LONG - but worth the read. 

It takes 10 - 20 years to build a brand, a business, a Real Estate Company to trust. But it takes 1 second to ruin it and any 5 star google reviews - this highlights the fragility of reputation and the importance of maintaining a positive image and public trust.

We often receive screenshots or shares of REALTOR® Marketing asking for our opinion. From REALTORS® and or Media Companies making fun of our profession, to REALTORS® making fun of their culture and people, to peeing on walls and floors of properties & homes, to taking personal photos & poking fun of Seniors homes to the most recent disregard of the human life during war and conflict. 

Memes can be a fun and effective way to engage with audiences on social media platforms like Instagram. However, when it comes to using memes for REALTOR® marketing, there are several reasons why they are NOT the best choice. My question is - who should be policing this?

Real Estate is a serious and often high-stakes industry. Memes, which are typically humorous or light-hearted, may not convey the professionalism and trustworthiness that potential clients expect from real estate professionals. Using memes can make you appear less serious and incompetent, lacking professionalism.

Memes are typically short, image-based content that may not provide enough information about a property or the real estate services you offer. Real estate marketing often requires in-depth information about properties, their features, pricing, and location, which is difficult to convey effectively through memes.

instagram,"In the wake of Israeli attacks on Gaza in response to 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,' initiated by Hamas, the response of Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt reflects the contrasting dynamics of sovereign and captured states.

In Lebanon, the immediate spillover of the war to the southern Lebanese borders was met with an initial official silence. Iran’s foreign minister made direct threats from Lebanon while the Secretary-General of Hezbollah refrained from commenting. Prime Minister Najib Mikati comically admitted that decisions regarding war and peace were beyond the government's authority. It is now 12 days into the war between Israel and Hamas, and Lebanese still don’t know which fate awaits them.

On the other hand, Jordan, and Egypt, two nations with direct geographic connection to Israel and Palestinian territories, have not compromised their national interests while still committing to their unwavering support to Palestine. Jordan emphasizes the need to prevent spillover of the crisis into its territory, prohibiting protests in border regions. Egypt provides humanitarian aid to Gaza but refuses permanent relocation of Palestinians to Sinai due to security concerns. These nations maintain their sovereignty, with governments acting in the best interests of their citizens.

These three stances highlight how sovereign, independent nations assert control over their territories. However, Lebanon, facing unique challenges, struggles with the influence of non-state actors in crucial matters, potentially endangering its land and people in the face of an irreversible conflict.",,166,"{'like_count': 158, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 11704}",PolyBlog,,2023-10-20 13:30:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/143905869_243823470650106_5332666147040290861_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=LZ-AOIhlz98AX-m68_W&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCg_6pBDVlGc32k5JvtfYR5KtgP6lQxxD8zZDgHdVAo_w&oe=655A6127,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyn1KQdM9Zx/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393707154_1233362120676264_1812060999149000275_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=m1eD9sdGJmIAX_u8CUu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA2uvTECDD29MzYeKQf4E7EtBe4Zj3zDT5BxiXFA53KNg&oe=65592284

Sadly, the west and even younger generations in the Middle East are woefully uneducated that the Holocaust took place in the Middle East and North Africa as well. They have little knowledge of a population that comprises a majority of Israeli Jews and their history as Dhimmis or the Nishul.

The dark truth about Neo Palestinian nationalism 

Let’s talk about the birth of the 
Neo Palestinians and their Nazi past 🎤 

Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a key figure in Palestinian Arab nationalism during the 20th century, sparked controversy with his association with Adolf Hitler during World War II. 🌟

🕌 Serving as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, he held influential positions in the local Arab community. Before the RE establishment of israel, he turned to Nazi Germany for support in furthering his nationalist objectives.

🤝 His friendship with Hitler is a topic of historical debate. He visited Nazi Germany, meeting high-ranking officials, including Hitler himself. His aim was to gain German assistance in opposing British and Jewish interests in the Middle East. While not formally a known as a Nazi, he sympathized with their anti-Semitic views and shared their opposition to Jewish immigration to the British mandate of Palestine.

🗣️ This association has drawn widespread criticism and continues to be a contentious subject in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Some view Al-Husseini as a collaborator with Nazi ideology, while others stress his pursuit of Palestinian nationalist goals. Nevertheless, his connection with Hitler remains a significant aspect of their dark past

instagram,"📌 Day 14 of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. 

🇮🇱 Israel continues to bomb Gaza—including regions in the south, where it asked Palestinians to seek safety. A morning raid on Khan Younis killed at least 21 people.

🇵🇸 FYI: At least 30% of all housing in Gaza has been damaged—ranging from destruction to uninhabitable in the last two weeks, as per the region’s housing ministry.

🇮🇱 Israeli air raids have hit the Al-Omari Mosque and the Saint Porphyrios church. Both structures are ~1,500 years old and hold great religious significance.

🇮🇱 The Israeli military has evacuated a town near Israel’s border with Lebanon, after attacking Hezbollah positions overnight. 

🇱🇧 This was in response to fire towards Israel that was carried out on Oct 19 from Lebanon.

📌 Gaza has not received aid through the Rafah border crossing yet, despite US President Biden’s repeated claims.

📸 4: Egyptians protest around the crossing until aid is allowed into the Gaza (Oct 20 | X/Palestine Online)

🇮🇱 IN ISRAEL: Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has told Israeli troops to “get organised” as they will soon see Gaza “from the inside”. Israel’s economy minister, Nir Barkat has said that the military  had a “green light” to move into Gaza whenever it was ready. (ABC network) 

🧮 An opinion poll by Israeli publication Maariv found that 80% of Israelis believe the country’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu should take responsibility for the Oct 7 Hamas attacks. This includes 69% of the people who voted for Netanyahu’s Likud party in last year’s election.

🥀 CASUALTIES: In Gaza, 4,137 people have been killed and 13,000+ have been injured. In occupied West Bank, at least 81 have been killed. In Israel, 1,403 have been killed, over 4,600 injured and 203 are being held hostage by Hamas.

instagram,"Friday started at Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and a ""Shabbat Dinner"" for the 203 people currently missing or held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. A powerful representation of the size of the group, the message was strengthened by the place settings with a handful of plastic plates and cutlery among the adult places. Again, words fail me as to how the families must be feeling.

Funerals have become a near-daily part of the coverage here, with families still burying their loved ones from the attacks of nearly two weeks ago. Today, it was two people from Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Both were deeply moving in their own ways; Omer Hermesh's love for Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C. meant his grave became a beacon of red. Mira Stahl's mourners reminded me so much of the friends I made in my 20's as I played music in Sheffield. Loving, close modern hippies who looked totally devastated to lose their friend in this violent way. During the traditional rush to fill the grave, one mourners bare feet against the earth galvanised that thought.

instagram,"The key to peace? Women 👇🏿 
 
“Women play a crucial role in promoting peace. As mothers and wives, they are often listened to and respected within their communities. Women have a natural talent for promoting reconciliation and conflict resolution. 
Perhaps this is linked to their unique role in the creation and preservation of life, but they also have a unique ability to resolve issues when conflict arises. This highlights the importance of including women in peace and mediation processes, as their perspective and skills are invaluable in building a more peaceful future,” says Ibrahim Mariama Allassane, 70 years old, the coordinator of the Nigerian NGO Réseau des Femmes pour la Paix au Niger (REFEPA Niger) which has acted as a trusted conflict mediator since 2006 and now focus more on women's rights and equal rights. 
In her experience, women don’t play a sufficient role in building peace: “I would say that they have the potential and the necessary skills, but they are not always fully involved. In Niger, we have trained women mediators (…) it would go a long way towards solving many problems and providing a better framework for the population through the mediation of women mediators.” 
Mariama and her colleagues at Réseau des Femmes pour la Paix au Niger are the people inspiring change and peace on the frontlines of conflict – and they will keep pushing: “Our main goal is to contribute, particularly through women's leadership, to influencing peace, working for its return and fighting for it. We want to be fully involved in conflict prevention and management issues at national level, while safeguarding women's rights. It is regrettable that during periods of crisis and war, women's rights are often neglected.” 

For the annual UN Security Council Open Debate on Women, Peace and Security, together with many other organisations, Oxfam is calling for the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation and leadership of women in all crises and conflicts and urge the Security Council, the UN, and Member States to uphold them.

I wanted to share each of these because it’s important to use my platform to raise awareness so my community understands what has been a long and complex battle. 

The first slide is a historical documentary of Malcolm-Xs early position on the Israel Palestine conflict.

The second slide represents leaders from the around the world calling out the war crimes of Israel. 

Third, a man who lost his entire family - wife and children - in Gaza b*mbings. 

Fourth, facts about Israel’s inhumane requirement for over 1 million Palestinians to leave which is nothing short of impossible. 

Sixth, Nelson Mandelas grandson rallying for Palestine. Nelson Mandela was a longggg advocate and fighter for Palestine. 

Seventh, one of many Palestinians forcefully displaced from their homes by J*wish Israelis (this has been happening for over 40 years).

instagram,"“Voices of integrity, voices filled with conviction are a powerful force for good,” Daisaku Ikeda, the Japanese Buddhist philosopher, and nuclear disarmament advocate said. The ongoing battle between Palestine and Israel isn’t just a war. It is a war on the mind and soul of every Israeli and Palestinian experiencing it, and the global audience watching it. Some with lament, and others with glee.

It is also destroying our trust in humanity. As much as we are made to believe that the conflict is about perpetual animosities, the truth is, it is all about land. What we are witnessing is an unending shrinking of a piece of land, an ongoing campaign to take it away from the people, and assemble them all in an untenable situation. It is a war where we are tuned to accept these mass atrocities, corroborated by an irresponsible media that has mobilised every racial trope of savagery that can be built on Islamophobia. The media has failed all these years to show the attacks on Palestinians shelters and refugee camps, ignoring their appeals to survive and somehow live together.

The parent of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp said the company’s policies are designed to give everyone a voice while prioritising safety, regardless of personal beliefs.

“The suggestion that we’re trying to suppress a particular community or point of view is categorically untrue,” Xiaohan Wu, its partner manager for Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, said in a statement mailed to Malaysia's fact-checking network JomCheck.

“Our policies are designed to give everyone a voice while keeping people safe on our apps, and we apply these policies regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs.”

It was one of the largest helicopter-borne raids conducted into Mozambique in the late years of the Rhodesian Bush War, an anti-insurgency conflict with similar complexity as the South African Border War fought by the South African Defense Forces in South West Africa and southern Angola, against Soviet-alined and supported enemy forces from the mid-1970s to the 1980s to January 1990, amidst the Angolan Civil War.

The Rhodesian Bush War and South African Border War were not the only decolonization era conflicts that Rhodesians and South Africans fought in, many were mercenaries for the (breakaway and unrecognized) State of Katanga - during the Congo Crisis of July 5th, 1960 to November 25th, 1965. 

__
The Congo Crisis was one of many proxy conflicts in Africa - in which the Western Bloc (USA and NATO) opposed factions supported by the Soviet Union (Eastern Bloc and Warsaw Pact).

🔹 Howling For Wolves Action Fund has lobbied our state’s legislators for over 7 years to advocate for laws that will ban wolf hunting in Minnesota.

🔹 Our Action Fund also works to ensure that nonlethal conflict reduction methods are prioritized and funding passed to encourage the coexistence of livestock producers, wolves, and the natural world.

🔹 Support Nonlethal Coexistence with Ranchers🐺❤️: In addition to a government-funded reimbursement for predator-related loss of livestock, Howling For Wolves compensates ranchers in exchange for the promise that the suspected wolf or wolves will not be tracked down and harmed in anyway.

🔹 Holding Agencies Accountable: We track state and federal agencies like Minnesota DNR and USFWS, ensuring they follow policy and advocate for these agencies to prioritize wolf protection. We create platforms for constituents to easily get in touch with their legislators and government agencies to howl for wolves! 📝

🔹 Spreading Awareness: Our billboard and radio campaign highlights the positive impact of wolves on biodiversity and our wild places. We work to inform folks of wolves’ important role in ecosystems and to drive action to protect wolves. 🌿🎙️

 🎨 As artists and cultural producers, our work has the power to shape public opinion. Today, as the media wages a war against truth and strips this conflict of its historical context, we have a unique responsibility to use our voice and artistic practices to say NO MORE! Now is the time to protest apartheid and amplify the just cause of the Palestinian people and their resistance against 75 years of occupation.

✊🏽 Artists and cultural workers, join us in standing firmly on the side of the oppressed. We say DOWN WITH OCCUPATION, UP WITH LIBERATION!

instagram,"I have so much love and respect for The Week Junior, a big-hearted, balanced and eye-opening news magazine that my children (7 and 9) love reading. They have put together some incredibly helpful resources on the situation in Gaza and how to talk to children about it in a sensitive way. Do have a look if you can. We need young readers to grow up knowing how to navigate the news and the world around them. Sometimes that means getting to grips with some big and tricky topics. This is where resources such as The Week Junior are truly invaluable.

The actions by the USS Carney, a naval destroyer off the coast of Yemen, potentially represented the first shots by the U.S. military in the defense of Israel in this conflict.

instagram,"I've done some of my favorite climbing in the Middle East and I'm so saddened by the recent events in Israel and Gaza. I'm sending my love to everyone impacted as the devastation continues and I'm praying for a more peaceful path forward for all.

My heart is with all those who have been displaced, are grieving, or living in fear. No one from either side of this conflict, or caught in its crossfire, deserves to be a victim of it. We all deserve to live freely and fully, and without fear of the future.

As we take our next steps, remember we can choose a brighter tomorrow. Our voices offer an opportunity to open communication wider and it is within our power to lead each other toward greater human understanding and harmony. Together, we can help hope and optimism outshine hate and extremism.

If you or a loved one are directly or indirectly affected by the developments in the Middle East, in any way at all, always know — I and @nobarriersusa are here for you 🧡 Reach out to us. We are your ally.

instagram,"Any escalation of military activities in the Gaza Strip will be “catastrophic” for people there, the UN high commissioner for refugees says, AFP reports.

“(I) can tell you with certainty that any further escalation or even continuation of military activities will just be catastrophic for the people of Gaza,” Filippo Grandi tells reporters in Japan.

While stressing that the refugee agency UNHCR has no formal mandate in the Palestinian Territories or Israel, Grandi says he “shares the extreme worry and anguish that has been expressed by many of my colleagues including the UN secretary general” about the conflict.

He also calls the Hamas attacks in Israel on October 7 “appalling” and said that the consequences of the conflict spreading into Lebanon and elsewhere would be “incalculable”.

instagram,"Flowers are absolutely not just decorative, but would it be such a bad thing if they were? This week on Their house, my garden, we cover the many reasons to let your garden bloom.

""Through summer in the northern hemisphere, hundreds of sunflower plants completely covered a terrace in the West Bank, Palestine. The green mass was tall and dense: they grew so thickly that you could not have passed through without damaging stems. At the top of it, yellow and orange sunflowers – some bigger than your palm – bloomed.

The sunflowers were not there to look pretty and joyful (though they did); they were there to repair the damaged and contaminated ground. The terrace has for decades been exposed to contaminants from armed conflict (like skunk-water) and urban pollution. Mohammed Saleh, a permaculture designer, educator and activist planted the sunflowers there to clean the soil. 

Bioremediation uses nature to heal contaminated and damaged lands and waters. It puts flowers to work, and sunflowers are particularly hard working. They can store radioactive elements like uranium and take up heavy metals like lead from the soil.""

instagram,"This may not be for you.  And that's okay.
But this is my journal of journey, if nothing else. So if the words fit you, run with it.

I have spent so much of my life believing that being a peacemaker meant being the one who surrenders, the one who admits fault first, who sits at the table with palms up.

And those things are good.  I take pride in my ability to do them, and do them well. 

But taking joy in being the person who seeks resolution doesn't mean I sacrifice everything for everyone.  It doesn't mean I sacrifice every time, for someone either. I heard a speaker recently say that, at their core, all relationships personal and professional require three things: safety, vitality and repairability.  It caused me to realize, in conflict, I sacrifice my safety to seek repairability in order to bring out vitality.

And I have a feeling that quite a few of us have that.  We were taught to ""take up our cross"" and that everything would come out right.  We were taught to ""turn the other cheek"".

And those lessons aren't wrong--they just aren't absolute. You're allowed to draw the line in the sand to say ""No, I deserve your attention. I deserve to know that you want me, that you see me."" 

And if those needs aren't met, I can still acknowledge that I've been hurt, even if I've caused hurt.  But I'm tired of waiting for my reward for being a martyr.

I deserve love and attention and validation. 
And you do too.

Because we're human, and that's enough.",,114,"{'like_count': 112, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 7101}",Freaky Lil Christians,,2023-10-20 13:30:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/311487871_841428500360483_1091860185797571892_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fYKJ33uqgccAX_6_2n-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAprTvO8PM-MSh6jTpeuBwI0s-9zoO3LgKB3Sf4G1OKyg&oe=655B864B,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyn1KvaO0IL/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393553141_1505133466927608_7153958677942681669_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=du7hIbwajXkAX9Ll27M&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB7N63GOo6AvW1agupoxm3SHpPb54PR65LwzII5juwVdA&oe=6548473D

instagram,"F*CK COLONIZATION in all It’s forms and modern day ways .

I’ve been processing and I have personally so much to celebrate in these last weeks but I also look back at how I even started this account because of my travels

My traveled that started studying genocide & post war conflict back in 2012 in the balkans and opened my eyes to see how the US actually ain’t all it’s cracked up to be…

How policies have impacted folks around the globe and how the Holocaust was not the only genocide but how it’s been continuously happening to folks all over 

In that realizing how much religion has been used as a tool of erasure and ethnic cleansing 

And last week in SF on indegenous peoples week I had this moment as I listened to this indegenous woman speak and reminding us of our ancestors & what ancestor  we want to be

Right now we’re seeing what our own ancestors went through.

I refuse to believe any lives are worth more than others in the end the way we pray and who how we pray makes no difference . We are human and deserve safety

And a reminder that people are not their government - we see this so clearly in the US how many of us do not support policy 

And the same goes for Israel and Palestine . The people are not their government and policies it does not ever justify being hurt and bombed as retribution

My heart goes out to all my Jewish and all my Muslim friends , friends in both Israel & Palestine that are hurting and scared . 

And people I know would never support the cleansing of innocent people who have no way out, this is a genocide and this it is not justified in any way. 

Right now we’re also seeing a rising up in Guatemala of people demanding their rights . And my heart goes out to all those rising up to demand Justice .

I am no expert but I know that to stand with those who are oppressed and dismantle all systems of colonization is what feels right in my eyes .

instagram,"In 2009, I went to Rwanda to make a film about their national cycling team. It was the 15th anniversary of the jen-o-side. In 1994, the world watched idly as ONE MILLION  Tutsis and moderate Hutus were k*led in just 100 days. People were distracted (or more interested in) by that OJ Simpson car chase and Nelson Madella being elected as South Africa's president- how ironic. 

Conflict between the two tribes had history- agitated with help by the Belgians- ah yes hurrah for us fellow Europeans. In 1993, the Rwanda government, led by Hutu president Habyarimana, signed a peace deal with the rebel party composed of mostly Tutsis, in an effort to bring the confli*t to an end. In April, the following year, the president was as*asinated and the Hutu majority soldiers and police started the kil*ing spree.

People kil*ed their neighbours because the radio told them to. If you married into a Tutsi family, you were ordered to kil* them, or face being kil*ed yourself. 

This bright and colourful national cycling team, was born from the ashes of the jen-o-side. They were made up of both Hutu and Tutsi and a beacon of hope and inspiration, uniting the country. They were like beautiful kingfishers flashing down the mountains as they rode in their Peletons. One cyclist made the London Olympics. I was proper proud of him and the country to see him compete. 

Whilst spending time with them in Rwanda and learning about what happened, I wondered HOW could  what happen, happen and the world turn away?! Or be so slow to intervene.

If you've ever wondered the same, please take one minute of your day to fill in the petition (in my stories and bio) asking the UK a government to call for an immediate ceasefire. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, imagine how the Pale*tin*ans and Isra*lis are feeling right now. Parents carrying their children's body parts in bags is not the answer.

instagram,"For the wounded, injured and sick in Gaza, there is seemingly no escape. 

This week hundreds of patients, staff and people seeking shelter from Israeli bombs had been killed in an explosion at a hospital, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave.

By that time, 4 hospitals had already ceased functioning in Gaza’s north because of damage from Israeli bombs. And beyond the immediate devastation of the current conflict, there will be significant and long-lasting implications for the Gaza Strip’s health system.

“I know that even before this latest escalation of violence, health services in Gaza were in a poor shape,” writes Palestinian health expert Yara M. Asi of @ucf.edu. 

“Insufficiently and poorly resourced for decades, doctors and hospitals also had to contend with the devastating effects of a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel, in part with coordination with Egypt.”

instagram,"The conflict in Israel and Gaza is deeply troubling and my heart goes out to the families of all those innocent lives lost on both sides.
 
Hamas’s terror attack on Israel was absolutely barbaric and cannot be justified.
 
The indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Gaza is also barbaric and cannot be justified.
 
Israel has the right to defend itself. But that must be proportionate and in adherence with international law.
 
There has already been too much bloodshed during this conflict. I join calls for an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages.
 
It is also vital that there is continued humanitarian access to Gaza and sufficient supplies of food, water, electricity and medicines.
 
As humans, it is only natural that we would be affected by seeing such loss and suffering.
 
But here in West Yorkshire our diversity is our strength and we must pull together instead of apart during troubling times. We cannot allow the tragic events in the Middle East to divide our communities.
 
I am aware of a small increase in reports of both Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime since the conflict flared up two weeks ago.
 
And I want to be absolutely clear that we must not and we will not stand for any such threats and abuse in our communities. We are in touch with faith leaders and West Yorkshire Police and have been assured that there will be a robust response to any perpetrator of hate in our region.

instagram,"For the wounded, injured and sick in Gaza, there is seemingly no escape. 

This week hundreds of patients, staff and people seeking shelter from Israeli bombs had been killed in an explosion at a hospital, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave.

By that time, 4 hospitals had already ceased functioning in Gaza’s north because of damage from Israeli bombs. And beyond the immediate devastation of the current conflict, there will be significant and long-lasting implications for the Gaza Strip’s health system.

“I know that even before this latest escalation of violence, health services in Gaza were in a poor shape,” writes Palestinian health expert Yara M. Asi of @ucf.edu. 

“Insufficiently and poorly resourced for decades, doctors and hospitals also had to contend with the devastating effects of a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel, in part with coordination with Egypt.”

instagram,"The World Health Organization said Thursday that five trucks full of medical supplies are ready at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, with hopes that the aid could be delivered to Palestinian hospitals as early as Friday. ⁠
⁠
""Our trucks are loaded and ready to go,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. The delivery of aid would be the first since Israel imposed a complete blockade on the Gaza Strip, following the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that killed over 1,400 Israelis. ⁠
⁠
Health authorities in the Gaza Strip said Thursday that at least 3,785 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli bombardment since the latest conflict erupted. ⁠
⁠
While aid continues to build up on the Egyptian side of the crossing, Egypt is not allowing Palestinians to cross from Gaza into the Egyptian Sinai peninsula. ⁠
⁠
Following a meeting on Wednesday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said such an exodus of people from Gaza would jeopardize Palestinian aspirations of statehood. ⁠
⁠
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced from their land in past conflicts with Israel, with many settling in Egypt and other neighboring states. Many refugees have never been allowed to return — and the regions fear the wider implications of Palestinians being forced to flee Gaza, said analyst Chris Doyle, director of the London-based Council for Arab-British Understanding. ⁠

To read translated literature is to give a voice to the marginalised.

Kashmir of India would find mention in every book written on the marginalised. But is Kashmir only about her conflict? No. It's also about the bustling streets, it is about the festivals they celebrate, about the ruins of temples that are going to resurrect in the future, it is about the school going kids, it is about her humans.

'For Now it is night' by Hari Krishna Kaul is one such humane collection of short stories of Kashmir and her people. It is a unique collaboration of translation by Kalpana Raina, Tanveer Ajsi, Gowhar Fazili, Gowhar Yaqoob from the Kashmiri into English. Picked from 4 of Kaul's books this book has 17 short stories based in Kashmir or at times on Kashmiri people living outside Kashmir.

So what are these stories about? There is a Kashmiri woman living in Delhi & her experience in her non-muslim neighborhood which she is happy about, there is Tara Chand a very noble man who has died & his ex-tenants are on their way to his funeral, there are 2 boys who are best friends and how things change in Kashmir while they remain in the same class year after year haha, and yes, there are stories about the political nature of the land. For Kashmiris - the political will always be personal.

My top pick is 'That We Cannot Speak Of,' exploring a Kashmiri Pandit's inner struggles pre 1990, dealing with his estranged Muslim friend's growing animosity, in silence. It reflects the challenges of a marginalized minority. Other favorites include 'One Sahib and the Other,' offering concise yet insightful political commentary through a conversation between two sahibs, 'A Song of Despair,' delving into the complex relationship of a rebel son and conservative father, and 'The Tongue and the Egg,' which uses a tale of a tongueless friend of a person to comment on power dynamics in the world.

I won't say these stories surpassed my expectations because I was barely expecting from them, but they are just so good, just so humane.

We stand with Save the Children with as they call upon the UK Government to stand with children and call for: 
 
An urgent ceasefire agreed by all parties to the conflict. Humanitarian assistance must be allowed to be delivered to children in Gaza. 
All children affected by the violence in Gaza and Israel must be protected and supported to find safety.
All parties to the conflict must respect international humanitarian law, commit no further grave violations against children and ensure that there is accountability for those committed to date.
All children captured must be released immediately and unconditionally.
Humanitarian assistance must be scaled up to meet the demands of the crisis. Aid must not be withheld from children.

Grade Vs embarked on a reflective journey, exploring the historic 1967 UN charter advocating a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, under the banner ""Our World, Our Promise."" This theme fostered a deeper understanding of global diplomacy and the seeds of hope it sows amidst adversities.

Venturing into the current geopolitical landscape, Grades VI to VIII convened for a ""Building Bridges"" panel discussion. This engaging dialogue encompassed an exploration of the prevailing situation in Palestine, delving into avenues of external support, donor agency access, and potential conflict resolution strategies.",,93,"{'like_count': 92, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 5528}",Academus International School,,2023-10-20 13:38:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/315678850_649794473486563_7397282528430864406_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ERjWEzB4WZYAX-48AJA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA8dVPb64j3cr9jZSJ06COCW5xPWnFKnSgHSkT2RAtvbQ&oe=655A1D4E,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyn2HqDonGA/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393336735_341961421662579_7300139436522157538_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KIZxouI3zXYAX8ESMv8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDkcZ5uXYwK7MraC8oc62Rg7uaEl6gIs_qX5f4vw4g2gw&oe=654493D8
instagram,"De Amerikaanse documentaire fotograaf Susan Meiselas deed jarenlang onafhankelijk verslag van oorlogen, humanitaire crises en andere relevante gebeurtenissen in Midden- en Zuid-Amerika, waaronder de Nicaraguaanse revolutie van 1978/1979. Haar foto’s brachten dit conflict onder wereldwijde aandacht en hadden een grote invloed op haar carrière als fotograaf: in 1979 ontving ze de Robert Capa Gold Medal.

Het is een bewuste keuze van Susan Meiselas om haar beelden in kleur te schieten. Daarmee kon ze de vitaliteit van de mensen en het optimisme van de opstand in beeld vangen.

Meiselas’ sociaal-documentaire projecten zijn gebaseerd op een langdurige en duurzame aanpak, waarbij ze vaak terugkeert naar de plekken en de mensen die ze heeft gefotografeerd. Door de foto’s steeds op andere manieren te tonen, zoals in films en in de openbare ruimte, reflecteert ze op de manier waarop fotografie impact kan hebben.

Foto’s van Meiselas zijn te zien in ‘Vrouwen aan het front – Van Lee Miller tot Anja Niedringhaus’, een tentoonstelling die afrekent met het beeld dat oorlogsfotografie uitsluitend een mannenzaak is. Te zien t/m 26 nov.

De tentoonstelling is mede mogelijk gemaakt door @ASNbank en @vfonds.

instagram,"Arabs and Jews living in the Belgian capital Brussels came together Thursday to send a message of peace amid the Israel-Palestine conflict.

They gathered in Schuman Square, where European Union buildings are located, carrying banners saying ""Peace now,"" ""Arab-Jewish solidarity,"" ""Our choice is unity"" and ""Political solution, not military.""

Speaking to Anadolu, Wassim Allouka, who is of Moroccan origin, said Arab and Jewish communities should live together by understanding each other's point of view.

Avi Tawil, a member of the Jewish community, also emphasized the importance of peaceful coexistence.

""While I wear my kippah, a Muslim woman should be able to walk freely with her headscarf. No one should be discriminated against because of their religion,"" he said.

Tawil said he believes there will be a time when Israelis and Palestinians will live in peace in the region and children will focus on their bright futures instead of bombs.

Patrick Menache, a Jewish Belgian citizen, said that Arab-Jewish tensions are politically based and it is possible for the two peoples to live in peace.

The conflict in Gaza, which has been under Israeli bombardment and a blockade since Oct. 7, began when the Palestinian group Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, a multi-pronged surprise attack that included a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel by land, sea and air.

It said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians.

The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.

Gaza is experiencing a dire humanitarian crisis with no electricity, while water, food, fuel and medical supplies are running out.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to ease the “epic human suffering.”

At least 3,785 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza, while more than 1,400 Israelis have been killed in the conflict.",,84,"{'like_count': 83, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 13354}",muslimjewishbrotherhood,,2023-10-20 07:16:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/384983331_1060310614974054_1458891557923464658_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SRPyzfV-N-wAX-a9Bik&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAizNgD51xG3CpznHruOY1zeBbxiz5dGNhPvmd8z9r7tw&oe=655B1481,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynKW4KNnYK/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393702714_725835642696091_1111352771367732998_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=5Gld_tfox4AAX9HF-0q&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCz0xWELywvBNYfzVF7eZvoBb2bgO54VN3VgNgg4vrGzA&oe=653C26D8

instagram,"Thank you Shawn Hoo of @straitstimes for this glowing review of 𝐒𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐨!

—

""[Jo] Tan’s complex, nuanced script switches between this tense, combative game and episodes from the couple’s past... In moments where the duo’s energies match, shades of unresolved conflict come to a potent head – built on the seemingly insurmountable differences between [Brendon Fernandez's] broody artistic character and [Jo Tan's] anxious contract lawyer.

""Appropriately, for a script about the balm of conjuring up one’s own fantasy, an austere set by Petrina Dawn Tan featuring a long white table and two chairs is a perfect step away from the naturalistic set design that Checkpoint’s shows favour.

""Checkpoint Theatre joint artistic director Huzir Sulaiman’s direction and dramaturgy keeps the play brisk and intriguing, transitioning between states of fantasy and reality without so much as an exposed seam to take the audience into a similar world of immersive game and power play.

""Beneath the play’s narrative is a universal story of how people give up their own agency in defining who they are when they only listen to the stories that others tell of them and play by others’ rules.

""𝐒𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐨 is a couple’s heart-rending exercise in letting go of the predetermined stories they have come to accept of themselves in favour of, however difficult it may be, inventing their own.""

Alle werknemers van Drs. Samana Clinics aan het Weena leggen hun werk neer.

Ze zijn niet de enigen: ook in andere landen wordt er gestaakt. Op sociale media werd deze week opgeroepen vrijdag niet te gaan werken en geen geld uit te geven. Doel is de economie te raken en op die manier aandacht te vragen voor de situatie van de Gazanen. Ook elders in Rotterdam blijven winkels en ondernemingen dicht. Hoeveel mensen er precies gehoor geven aan de oproep, is niet duidelijk.

instagram,"“I couldn’t shift anything; I resigned.”

Josh Paul, a US State Department official, has resigned over President Joe Biden's handling of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.

The senior official, who has worked for over a decade on arms transfers in the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, announced his retirement on October 18 in a two-page letter.

Explaining his reasons for resigning, he wrote: “I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and Palestinian people - and is not in the long-term American interest"".

Paul also expressed his desire to protect innocent people – both Israeli and Palestinian.

“Collective punishment is an enemy to that desire, whether it involves demolishing one home or one thousand; as too is ethnic cleansing; as too is occupation; as too is apartheid,"" he said.

During a speech in Tel Aviv on October 17, US President Joe Biden voiced his complete support for Israel and its actions against Palestinian armed groups in Gaza.",,77,"{'like_count': 69, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 25445}",TRT Afrika,,2023-10-20 06:29:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/336256152_206265795386681_6085097799802636119_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=PEK3wy-cIoQAX_4Fv_M&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAnuETNSHn2FnxpKITZ9oTFEJ2Gqju-K32xjO0mn4bjgQ&oe=655B3361,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynFDS7KxQp/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/392878293_300566249428851_1330501813987357873_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=dPtwtY5Tqp8AX8b2HdC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAGqt6T3rbqLiIXJu_X0K8a3S-dmdquwnoQKmyegaWzpA&oe=653FDDD9

instagram,"Posted @withregram • @ivybarkakati 

On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel’s bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world’s most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

“As scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.”

instagram,"Our mission has never been more critical: using the history and lessons of the Holocaust to build a just and caring community free of antisemitism and all forms of prejudice and bigotry. 

This is a difficult time for me personally, and I know it is difficult for many of us in the community and beyond. I believe it is a difficult moment for humanity. Our hearts are with the people of Israel as they bury and honor those who were brutally murdered, as well as with the citizens of Gaza whose lives are in danger daily.

While we can disagree about how to solve the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we can all agree that loss of innocent lives is not going to advance the cause for peace in the Middle East. 

Many people wonder how we cope with the events happening around us every day. We manage by finding meaning in the present, remembering the strength of Holocaust survivor Tess Wise, who wanted us to learn about being strong and hopeful, and by teaching others important lessons from this time in history.

With Tess’s legacy in mind, our Center will continue to welcome everyone who seeks to learn about the consequences of hatred and the power of hope and resilience.

instagram,"On Cazenove Road in north London, the mosque and synagogue are a few doors from each other.

Rabbi Hershel Gluck says the Jewish community welcomed Muslims into the area decades ago and they have lived peacefully together ever since. But can a war many miles away change that?

Outside the North London Muslim Community Centre, we meet a young woman called Salma. She fears events abroad are pulling at the seams of unity.

She says: ""Of course everyone is worried about tensions flaring up. It's on everyone's mind. It weighs heavily on everyone's mind.""

Rabbi Gluck says that's not the case in Stoke Newington.

""You walked round these streets this morning and you see terrific integration,"" he says.

""You don't see any conflict. You see people engaging with one another, smiling at one another, seeing each other as equal, friends and human beings.""

We are both invited into the North London Muslim Community Centre by its secretary, Mohammed Gajia.

There's building work under way in several rooms but at the back is a pristine sports hall where community events are held, which the two men tell me often include people of other faiths.

Mohammed says of Rabbi Gluck: ""We are friends. I have known him for over 30 years.""

Of the demonstrations, he says: ""A lot of people want to go on Saturday for the protest. I know my granddaughters go. I think it's only to support the people of Palestine, the people of Gaza - not any organisation.""

As we are leaving, a police van pulls up and officers go into the centre. They tell me this is a ""reassurance patrol,"" but there haven't been reports of any trouble.

instagram,"Besides targeting hospitals, schools, apartment buildings, churches, refugee centers and other declared “safe zones,” the Israel regime has bombed five bakeries, including one of the largest facilities that supplied bread to 100,000 Palestinians. A strategy with a specific outcome: to starve the people. 
 
Daily lines for bread have been congested with starving people waiting up to 5 hours for bread. Many Palestinians are down to one meal a day and continue drinking dirty water. 
 
All of these tactics align with the regime’s Dahiya Doctrine, designed to respond with “asymmetrical force” stressing that in a conflict with Hamas, the Israeli army should use ""force that is disproportionate to the enemy's actions and the threat it poses.""
 
Let me say this: after  seven decades of committing war crimes without impunity, Israel is facing an unexpected force it hadn’t considered in the past: global outrage. 
 
Our voices have forced the regime to recant its gruesome “victories” and continue to dismantle their propaganda machine. 
 
Keep going, fellow misfits and noisemakers. We cannot stop resisting and naming this continued genocide of the Palestinian people until Palestine is free.

The unadulterated evil and moral depravity we are amidst is unfathomable!

Op dit moment vindt er een ontegenzeglijk lijden plaats in het Midden-Oosten. Een 75 jaar oud conflict bereikt het hoogtepunt.
Talloze mensen lijden aan beide kanten; Israël en Palestina.
Op zondag 22 oktober komen we online samen in liefde om te mediteren voor alle betrokkenen. 
Samen verlevendigen we een veld van eenheid, compassie, liefde en positieve kracht.👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
Verbonden in 1 hart.💞🙏🏽
Vrede begint in ons zelf.💫
De gedachten en meditatie gaan uit naar alle slachtoffers.
Onze hoop gaat uit naar vrede waarin we blijven geloven.

Je hoeft geen partij te kiezen.
En niemand te veroordelen.
Je mag alle theorieën volgen en geloven wat je wilt.
Maar het belangrijkste in deze fase is menselijkheid.
Steunbetuigen door liefde, compassie en bewustzijn te richten naar alle betrokkenen.
Er zijn geen winnaars in een oorlog. Alleen maar verliezers.

While the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have conducted its largest mobilization since the Yom Kipper War of October 1973 — around 350,000 military personnel with hundreds of armored vehicles and artillery pieces - laying siege to the Gaza Strip.

[The war] began on October 7th, 2023, when heavily armed militants invaded southern Israel and killed 1,400 Israelis (largely civilians - woman, children, elderly, and families killed in their homes), those numbers include 260 civilians who were killed at the Music festival in Re'im.

The new Sol Collection is full of mix & match pieces. My personal favorite are the Starburst motif bangles you can get with or without pave diamonds💎

2 CNTs neutralized, HPFAs recovered in Negros Occidental 

Army operating troops of the 79th Infantry ""Masaligan"" Battalion (79IB) of the 3rd Infantry ""Spearhead"" Division (3ID) facilitated the neutralization of two CPP-NPA Terrorists and the recovery of six High-powered Firearms including two M16 rifles, an M14 rifle, an AR15 rifle, an M16 rifle, a Garand rifle, four rifle grenades, assorted live ammunitions, assorted bandoliers, and other CNT's personal belongings and subversive documents after an encounter in Sitio Nabalas Dos, Brgy. Canlusong, E.B. Magalona town, Negros Occidental on October 17, 2023.

Acting on information from a concerned citizen, the Army troops launched a military operation that led to a 15-minute firefight against CNT members belonging to Northern Negros Front, Komiteng Rehiyon. 

The Army leadership commended the 79IB for their steadfast action that resulted in the neutralization of two CNT members and the recovery of HPFAs during the performance of their duty to serve the people and secure the communities of the province of Negros Occidental.

However at this point i would be doing a disservice to my community by not bringing this up. In the months leading up to the start of the  2023 Isreal-Hamas Conflict, current president Netanyahu's government was on the brink of civil war. Primarily young people flooded the streets every night calling for the government to resign. Then suddely Hamas(created by Mossad to disrupt the secular PLO) attacked a random festival and houses killing 1300 people. Following that the Netanyahu government suddenly was no longer enemy number 1 and the very same people who were out on the streets opposing the regime are now calling for said regime to use the state to carry out ""revenge"" against people said state has been systematically supressing for 70 years. Netanyahu's people were also warned of a possible attack. Considering Isreal is a satellite state of the US, a country in which Bush(at the time hated president) and friends were told about an attack coming from a group the US helped form and let it happen, I would not be shocked at all if this was just a repeat of 911. Im not saying for sure this has been a false flag attack but at this point the possibility needs to be investigated.",,67,"{'like_count': 60, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 668}",⚒MLMp Sex Maoist📕[🇦🇿/🇷🇺🇨🇳]☸,,2023-10-20 06:49:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/353792360_1365769700646079_3497372755425634464_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=BZFa0-TK6XIAX-2LeGL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAJHE7FiV0aiPMlZv8rgua4vwQdKST7mV4TBR56UEJLIg&oe=655AE22D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynHXBrOSQT/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393158713_2020434231631789_4629568810615445354_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=VbvsD4y-BtMAX9eIbWG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCNK4_0BBrZXaF9891JuB6XJOiFA-UWnsPpenc4pVpNmA&oe=655AAFC0

As upsetting as it can be when our kids experience drama with friends, these situations are golden opportunities for shaping our children’s character and social skills. Conflict reveals their strengths and weaknesses, their friendship habits, how they respond to stress, conflict, and hurt. Our children need us to shepherd their hearts in all these areas.

My heart aches with the horrific events going on between Israelis and Palestinians. I spent many days with the team of @saisonsmusique considering whether to cancel this release, which had been scheduled long before the conflict broke out.

In the end we decided to release the music, hoping that for a moment this music can take us to a place beyond right and wrong and beyond suffering.

I wish for these songs to resonate and contribute towards peace everywhere.

instagram,"🎭🪧: Week 13 of SAG-AFTRA Strike | 10.10 #latergram 
I’ve been putting off posting these series of photos to my feed. Deep fear of coming across as tone deaf. 

On the 10th October I was honoured with an invitation to the WGAE Celebration Party. Thank you to all the strike captains and new friends who advocated for me to be included. I LOVE YOU WGA FAMILY. SOLIDARITY FOREVER. 🙌🏾

It was such a wonderful evening filled with victory, hope and possibility of a brighter future for our industry even if it came just 3 days following conflict in the Middle East and in the digital world. A day later…the AMPTP walked away from the table and negotiations with SAG-AFTRA stalled.   It felt like yet another gut punch just when things were looking up. Is this upper-limiting (read The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks) or are the AMPTP really that dishonorable? I am choosing now to post these photos as a reminder of what the other side of strike looks like. Remembering that miracles can happen in the 11th hour. Actors if we band together, lean on each other and stay resolute for a fair deal that benefits ALL television and film performers…we. will. win.   One day longer. One day stronger! 

As long as it takes. 
-V.

In Tijuana, they met with migrant women supported through our Women Livelihood Program, thanks to the support of the #LorealFundForWomen. After attending a business training session with one group at @immujertijuana, the Municipal Women's Institute of Tijuana, they participated in the program's first Business Plan Competition. At the end of the competition, four promising projects were selected to receive backstopping and financial support. It was truly inspiring to meet so many strong and determined women! 👏

During their visit to Tijuana, Caroline and Valentine also had the opportunity to visit two of our partner schools, where they met with students and parents participating in our Conflict Resolution Education training program.

Here’s an excerpt from The Straits Budget,  acknowledging the accomplishment of one of the pioneer soldiers of the Malay Regiment.

“MAJOR MOHD. TAIB, 40, who was promoted recently is the fifth Malay Major in the Malay Regiment. He joined the Regiment when it was formed in March 1933.– Malay Regiment P.R. picture.”

🙏 Nous nous joignons aux appels à la paix et à un cessez-le-feu immédiat de la guerre qui se déroule actuellement entre Israël et la Palestine.

💔 Á ce stade, après les attaques du 7 octobre, après la frappe sur un hôpital, il est urgent d’oeuvrer uniquement vers une résolution de ce confit et d’ouvrir tous les chemins vers la paix.

Tant que cette guerre durera, ce seront des innocents, humains et animaux qui en payeront le prix.

💔 Alors que le bilan humain dépasse désormais les 4 200 morts, n’oublions pas les victimes animales, peu ou jamais mentionnées par les médias.

Nos cœurs se serrent pour toutes les victimes humaines et leurs familles et les innombrables vies animales fauchées lors de ces bombardements. Et le nombre incalculable de survivants blessés, affamés, terrifiés,..

Alors que l’aide se complique pour la population, que faire pour les animaux? 

😡 Les seuls qui peuvent se réjouir des guerres, se sont les gouvernements belligérants et les marchants d’armes, leurs amis.
🙏❤️ Toute cette violence et ces massacres doivent cesser.

🙏 Wij sluiten ons aan bij de oproepen voor vrede en een onmiddellijk staakt-het-vuren in de voortdurende oorlog tussen Israël en Palestina.

💔 In dit stadium, na de aanslagen van 7 oktober, na de aanval op een ziekenhuis, is het dringend noodzakelijk om alleen te werken aan een oplossing van dit conflict en alle wegen naar vrede te openen.

Zolang deze oorlog voortduurt, zullen onschuldige mensen en dieren daar de gevolgen van ondervinden.

💔 Terwijl het dodental onder de mensen nu de 4200 heeft overschreden, mogen we de slachtoffers onder de dieren niet vergeten, die weinig of geen aandacht krijgen in de media.

Ons hart gaat uit naar alle menselijke slachtoffers en hun families en de ontelbare dierenlevens die tijdens deze bombardementen zijn uitgeroeid. 

Hulp naar de bevolking is al moeilijk. Wat met de dieren?

Al dit geweld en deze slachtpartijen moeten stoppen. 
🙏❤️ Laten we onze stem verheffen voor vrede.

instagram,"Palestinians in Gaza, including women, children, and the disabled, face immense hardship and trauma due to continuous conflict. They turn to resistance as a means of coping with loss and violence. The international community's failure to intervene challenges their faith in democracy and peaceful resistance, potentially shaping the attitudes of the younger generation. Amidst tragedy, Palestinians continue to exhibit resilience and multifaceted identities, fighting for their rights and existence with love and determination.

instagram,"The world is in a troubled state right now, and the horrible and heartbreaking outbreak of violence in the Middle East sees us in shock and disbelief.
 
The Circus has, a long time ago, made friends with the guys behind the @abrahamhostels in Israel, who have stayed with us often, who enjoyed Berlin as much as we do, and who have been – and will be – advocates for a peaceful, inclusive and non-nationalist future of the area. They have been for years organizing events, get togethers, cultural events meant to make a change for a cooperative way to live, based on compromise and understanding. They have been a force of good in a partly hostile environment with too many people that are not.
 
The parents of one of the founders of our friends hostels became victim of the conflict last week, and I am personally still struggling to understand and digest this news.
 
The Abraham hostels have opened their houses for all victims of the conflict, independent from their religious background, and are right now hosting refugees, feeding them, offering support, emotional and personal assistance. They do, what a hostel can do in its very best moment: give shelter and home to those in need.
 
We would like to let you know about an initiative through which you can help to relieve the burden for them and support these admirable guys in what they are doing. This request of support is not a political statement. It is the attempt to support individuals we really like and that are trying to make a difference, and that are trying to do the right thing. Please trust us when we reassure you that your support is used in the wisest way possible. You’ll find the link here: https://www.abraham.travel/group/donate/
 
Thank you very much, and we – like you – are so very very much looking forward to the day when the guns finally and for all time turn silent.

instagram,"A Coroner's inquest has opened to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of the 12 year old boy with the missing intestine , Adebola Akin-Bright, who died at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH).

At the preliminary sitting, the presiding Coroner, Bola Folarin-Williams, sitting at Magistrate Court 4, Botanical Gardens, Ebute-Metta, heard opening statements from all the counsel involved with the case.

The state counsel from the Lagos Ministry of Justice, Ola Akinde told the court that necessary tests and examinations have been conducted on the corpse, and that the post-mortem report is ready. He added that the office of the Attorney General has received letters from the family's lawyers seeking the release of the corpse for burial and for the corpse to be preserved. 

Lawyer representing the father of the deceased, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN) also requested to invite the medical director of Hobitox Medical Centre where the deceased was first admitted and treated, as well as the doctors that treated him at LASUTH and all policemen involved in the investigation, in order to have a proper understanding of what actually happened to the young boy.

Mr Adegboruwa also applied to the coroner for an independent examination of the corpse so as to avoid the likelihood of bias and conflict of interests.

Another counsel, Abiodun Kolawole, appeared as an interested party for the African Women Lawyers Association.

After hearing all the counsel, the coroner directed that the autopsy report and all other documents be made available to the parties involved.

The coroner also urged all the counsel to harmonise their positions and submit the list of their intended witnesses before the next date. 

The case was adjourned to 24th November 2023, for further proceedings.

Adebola died at LASUTH on September 19, following a plea by his mother to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to probe the disappearance of her son’s small intestines, said to have occurred while he was receiving treatment at the state-run facility.

But, the hospital management, however, denied the allegation.

instagram,"»Hard to be Soft – A Belfast Prayer« ist eine dichte Beschreibung des nordirischen Alltags, ein Porträt der Arbeiter*innenklasse, ihrer Härte und ihrer Verletzlichkeit. In ihrer geradlinigen Erzählweise erforscht die Tänzerin und Choreografin Oona Doherty, Spotlight-Künstlerin des diesjährigen Tanzfestivals, Inszenierungen von Männlichkeit, die Rollen der Frauen, Klassenidentität, Religion, Sexualität, Wut und Widerständigkeit – ausgehend von Erinnerungen an ihre eigene Jugend in Belfast, Nordirland.

Kraftvoll, zwischen rabiater Zudringlichkeit und verhaltener Zärtlichkeit tanzen Oona Doherty und ihre neun Tänzer*innen begleitet von einer Gruppe junger Tänzer*innen aus Wiesbaden, die die Schönheit und den Schrecken hervorhebt, die als Spuren des Nordirlandkonflikts, dem Kampf um Religion und Zugehörigkeit, noch immer wirksam sind. Es ist ein Versuch, dieses Erbe durch ihre Bewegung und ihren Schweiß zu überwinden.

[EN]
Hard to be Soft – A Belfast Prayer is a detailed description of everyday life in Northern Ireland and a portrait of its working class, their toughness and their vulnerability. Using a direct narrative style, the dancer and choreographer Oona Doherty, Spotlight Artist at this year’s festival, explores machismo, the roles of women, class identity, religion, sexuality, anger and resistance – based on memories of her own youth in Belfast, Northern Ireland. 

Dancing with a powerful combination of brutal defiance and restrained tenderness, Oona Doherty and her nine dancers are accompanied by a group of young dancers from Wiesbaden, that underlines the beauty and horror that persist as remnants of the Northern Ireland troubles, of a conflict between religions and identities. It is their attempt to overcome this legacy through their own movement and sweat.

instagram,"It is impossible to lead a fully-realized life without encountering conflict, and it is irresponsible to try. Let it be a test and source of growth, rather than a source of regret. As unpleasant and uncomfortable as it is in the moment, I’ve learned more from my disagreements than I have from times when everything was peaceful. What’s that saying, “steady waters don’t make good sailors?”. Don’t fear conflict, but be wary of those who refuse to own their part in it.

instagram,"To all the “ I stand with Israel” and “ The God of Israel” folks.
Let me remind you that Israel don't give a shit about you or your religion or Jesus.
Since your only support of Israel in this conflict is solely based on Religion.
My dear, go and worship your “ Living God” and not the “God of Israel” when the government of Israel is ready to throw you in jail for preaching Christianity in their country. .
Just this year, laws were proposed to jail Christians in Israel. If you dare preach to anyone 😁.
I have so much empathy for our people and the damage religion has done to them.
Christians could face one year prison sentence for encouraging conversion to their faith, according to a new controversial legislation being introduced in Israel.

Title: Metaerie: Wings Tip the Scales 

Genre: Thriller 

Review:
This is the second book of the series and trust me it will be an amazing read, might have better actions than the first one.and it continues to explore the magical realm of Metaerie. 

The plot revolves around a world where humans and their descendants now make up a significant portion of the population, alongside Dragons and Pixies. These beings wield ancient magic, but the Old World's traditions, which include deception and violence, continue to play a significant role in the characters' lives, making abrupt mortality a central theme.

The story unfolds as mages and warriors from different age groups come together to face a growing division within the realm. Witches, wyverns, dragons, and the undead are part of the mix, creating a diverse and perilous landscape. The question of whether the enemy of one's enemy is a friend or not adds depth to the character interactions and the overarching conflict.

It was a fantastic and an enjoyable read that will keep the readers on the edge of the chair. The book further delves into the intricate motivations of the characters. The story challenges readers to discern truth from deception and to understand the complex motives that guide individuals and groups in this magical world. The language is simple but I will recommend this book to the people above 16 years of age. The cover is simple with an apt title.

instagram,"NIEUW: De geactualiseerde biografie van de eigenzinnige dichter en theoloog Huub Oosterhuis die met zijn kerkliederen het geloofsleven in Nederland diepgaand beïnvloedde. 'Intelligente biografie' - NRC

In Huub Oosterhuis. De biografie vertelt Marc van Dijk het levensverhaal van de invloedrijke theoloog en dichter. Van zijn kinderjaren in bezet Amsterdam tot zijn laatste uren. Oosterhuis las de Bijbel als een politiek manifest, schreef liederen die in meerdere talen gezongen worden en stichtte culturele podia als De Balie, De Rode Hoed en De Nieuwe Liefde. Hij verbond zich met de SP, maar ook met de koninklijke familie. Nadat hij met Rome in conflict raakte over het verplichte celibaat, zette hij zijn werk voort op eigen kracht. Hij wilde de grenzen tussen religie, politiek en poëzie opheffen. Zijn taal oversteeg tegenstellingen en bracht nieuwe bezieling in een tijd van snelle secularisatie.

Marc van Dijk interviewde Huub Oosterhuis gedurende vele jaren voor deze biografie. Oosterhuis heeft zijn eigen woorden geautoriseerd. Ook de kroongetuigen uit zijn leven komen aan het woord; zijn kinderen Tjeerd en Trijntje, (oud-)collega’s en (ex-)geliefden. Zo ontstaat een veelzijdig beeld van 'de paus van Amsterdam'.

instagram,"happy Friday 🤍
some important thoughts of mine below:
•
🫖 drinking “quiet mind” today. it’s an herbal blend with lemon balm, milky oat tops, passionflower, chamomile, and a few other calming herbs. think it’s quite an appropriate blend for some ruminating about everything going on in the world right now. have already shared + plan to continue to share my thoughts, just can be hard to find the right words to say. made me so sad to see misinformation spread this week about the hospital explosion. the fact that so many people - well educated friends, the media, colleagues - were so quick to characterize this as a deliberate attack by the IDF without allowing thorough investigation to take place is terrifying. it’s important to remember that the first causality in any war is the truth. this uncritical misreporting has a realistic potential to spark an even greater conflict in the Middle East - with the almost certain outcome of more civilian casualties. 
•
as this conflict continues to escalate and we enter 2 weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, I’m especially thinking of the 201 hostages who have not yet been released 🤍 thinking also of the many civilians in Gaza who have lost lives and loved ones, who continue to suffer under Hamas’ reign. 
• 
I hope that we come to a place someday where Israel can exist amongst peace and democracy in the Middle East

instagram,"Best Interest of the Child Principle - An Explanation

The best interest of the child principle is an age-old concept that first emerged as an articulate standard in American adoption law in the mid-1800s.1. The best interest of the child is a dispositional standard, designed to guide judges when making decisions that concern children. Under traditional American family law such decisions only fall to a judge after a parent has been convicted of abuse or neglect, or in a divorce context when there is conflict between competing parents. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently recognized “that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children.”2. American law has historically operated on the presumption that parents are fit to make decisions in the interest of their children unless proven otherwise. 

This new human rights application of the best interest of the child principle, as implemented in U.N. treaties such as the CRC and the CRPD, abolishes the presumption of parental fitness. Under this misapplication, judicial prerogative to determine the child’s best interest becomes the default, rather than a last-resort reserved for when a parent has been proven unfit. Parents’ private choices for their children can be called into question any time government personnel disagree with them.

International law expert Geraldine Van Bueren clearly describes this emerging human rights application:

Best interests provides decision and policy makers with the authority to substitute their own decisions for either the child's or the parents', providing it is based on considerations of the best interests of the child. Thus, the Convention challenges the concept that family life is always in the best interests of children and that parents are always capable of deciding what is best for children. 3.

We will be worshipping with Jews, Arabs and Americans in English, Arabic and Hebrew while sharing updates, perspective and praying over this raging conflict. 

We are commanded to “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.”

Students in the Emory Dance Company will perform in the galleries alongside Assistant Professor of Dance Julio Medina, celebrating and reflecting on contemporary photography by Latinx artists across the United States. Medina's pedagogy draws from two philosophies: Knowledge of Self and Pedagogy of the Oppressed; as a result, his work is identity-based in nature, and his choreography is rooted in a deep curiosity about the complex layers of resilience, conflict, and connection as a Chicano.

instagram,"I am a theologian, and I am a mother. Those two things are inextricable.

In a time when many are arguing about the justice of war, it feels more important than ever to remember this name for God. It seems like on all sides of the conflict are people fighting in the name of their God, in the name of justice, or in the name of retribution.

Throughout history, so many have perished in the name of God, with Christians more often than not leading the charge. I don’t think that’s who God is; I think that’s who humans have wanted God to be.

I don’t have any of the answers to the conflict in the Middle East. I’m not a politician; I’m not a historian. I’m a theologian and I am a mother. I know that how we see God matters and I know that much of our theology till now has borne rotten fruit. This is what it looks like to explore fresh ideas about God. 💓

instagram,"@grrrgraphics Joe Biden, the Lying, Flying Carpet
New #bengarrison cartoon

#JoeBiden’s trip to #Israel has been lauded by the left, but to me it was nothing more than a publicity stunt designed to prop up his failing campaign for a second term.

During his visit, he displayed his usual confusion and befuddled babbling. He got snubbed by Arab leaders while he insulted Israel by saying #Hamas needed to become ‘better shots.’ He also called them a ‘team,’ as if the conflict were a sporting event. Then, for some reason, Biden said he was born in Israel.

instagram,"VICE ADMIRAL GAVAN IS THE 30TH PCG COMMANDANT 🇵🇭

Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Jaime Bautista announces the appointment of CG VICE ADMIRAL RONNIE GIL LATORILLA GAVAN as the 30th Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Commandant during the Change of Command Ceremony at the National Headquarters, Port Area, Manila, today, 19 October 2023. 

In his speech, the Transportation Secretary expressed his trust and confidence that CG Vice Admiral Gavan would efficiently lead the PCG in implementing the ""White Hull Approach"" towards upholding maritime security and safety in the country's exclusive economic zones.

""Admiral Art was hailed for his innate peace mindset that steered the country away from any deterioration in the volatile situation at the West Philippine Sea,"" DOTr Secretary Bautista said. 

""My belief that Vice Admiral Ronnie Gavan will do the same is anchored on his record of shifting to the 'White Hull Approach' when securing our maritime borders and his introduction of female radio operators, called 'Angels of the Sea,' as a way of diffusing tension during sea conflict,"" he furthered. 

Moreover, the Transportation Secretary emphasized President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr's directives to the PCG during its 122nd founding anniversary as it moved forward to provide better public service to the Filipino nation. 

""I expect the PCG to provide steadfast service and dedication to duty during times of calamity; uphold our country's maritime security and promote our maritime rights; do its part in fighting smuggling; protect our marine environment; and secure the safety of our fishermen when pursuing their means of livelihood,"" DOTr Secretary Bautista highlighted.

""The Department of Transportation firmly stands with you in your plans and efforts to improve, expand, and modernize your capabilities and services so you can level up your efforts at securing the welfare of our people and our nation,"" he concluded. 

The Chief Executive chose CG Vice Admiral Gavan among five recommended candidates to take over the Coast Guard helm following the retirement of CG Admiral Artemio Abu after over 35 years of public service on the same date.",,42,"{'like_count': 42, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 19361}",Philippine Coast Guard,,2023-10-20 07:17:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/307846384_1602800456845665_4158688990046238164_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=oMV7JodC-wcAX9RSElA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCFaaS47PFgtX2UuHzkJ5AcqvpwBCdog7jfm6gn6oIJAw&oe=655AA93E,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynKfa2yzH1/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393271443_1004511847325945_794486505305654027_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=n9o11xXxudoAX8LCU63&_nc_oc=AQl_jx7ND2FIVc19JDVYc8ZEIv7h6-ls68T_ECVhZANEfV6Y_xPoAlPBGGoGiYIxjoQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAwA2KGvsQiclevXF1E01T_7B7SARKhEdyc-ue-O_lSTg&oe=6543F2BB

instagram,"Started my read of In Truth, Madness by Imran Khan as part of the tour for Love Books Tours. 

My tour date is the 27th October when I will be posting my review. 

Blurb

The perfect read for Neil Gaiman fans. 

Meet Malek Khalil, a brilliant reporter with decades of experience in the field, and a man on the edge. Where there is war, natural disaster or political crisis, Malek is in the midst of it, but years of conflict reporting have taken their toll and he is slowly unravelling. 
His colleagues, Neeka and Justin, have noticed a change in him, beyond even his usual vivid imagination. Neeka is especially sensitive, having been his friend and producer for many years, and perhaps knowing him better than he knows himself. Justin, a skilled and brave cameraman, has worked with them for just as long and the three make a formidable team - but they are only as strong as each other - and Malek is fast going down the rabbit hole.

Born a Muslim but an atheist to his core, Malek's voyage takes him around the world and back in time to ancient Babylon, as he finds himself arguing with a God in whom he does not believe. A keen reader, his 'madness' is heightened by a strange book that keeps appearing on his Kindle, telling the stories of people he has briefly encountered during his career.

In Truth, Madness takes place in the Middle East, South Asia and London against a backdrop of war, religion, political skullduggery and emerging love, taking the reader on a tumultuous journey through the most dangerous arenas of modern culture and the ancient world. 

Is Malek losing his mind, or is he experiencing an astonishing kind of truth?

instagram,"TRANSFORMATION—This war is different.

That message, a drumbeat from Israeli leaders ever since the savage Hamas attack on Oct. 7, refers to the unprecedented scale of their intended military response.

But it is also true on a deeper personal, psychological, and emotional level – not just for Israelis, but for Palestinians, too. The war is stripping back their conflict over a piece of land to its rawest essentials, leaving people on both sides feeling vulnerable and victimized, apprehensive and angry.

The central question is whether this different war ultimately produces a different outcome – a path toward a political resolution of their conflict that Israelis and Palestinians alike will be able to embrace.

The depth of the parallel Israeli and Palestinian agonies at the moment is apt to make resetting Mideast politics a slow, difficult challenge, no matter how this war ends.

But a decade of diplomatic neglect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has now ended. Those parallel agonies have focused U.S. and other Western minds – along with those of more moderate Arab regimes – on the urgent need to create a new narrative. If it addresses the interlocking fears of both sides, it might just lay the foundations for a lasting peace.

instagram,My new friend was in so much emotional pain on Wednesday that the tears just wouldn’t stop falling. People without homes are often forced to live in “fight/flight/freeze” mode which leads to long term challenges regulating when and how someone needs to react to provocation. Shelters often create a proximity problem by forcing a large number of traumatized people under one roof with very little privacy and limited access to bathrooms. In some cases this environment can lead to power dynamics and conflict that forces people to fight for their own autonomy which inevitably leads to punishment and sometimes banishment. People often choose to sleep outside because they do not feel safe in these environments.,,38,"{'like_count': 35, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 1100}",Josiah Haken,,2023-10-20 12:13:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/241558722_2643501962619612_2384547697851755653_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=-dz4hk_yd7wAX8WelXB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAHEwwFgYPw1rNLdmb2rlkrqUwMiOtiXkFHwoxhjMjz4Q&oe=655BA3B0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CynsZm2rm38/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394451228_257351827267917_8217356122763186050_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JL95TP881wgAX8TIdlY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBKGCYp2pV2bbja2jRDmlbpLrDV3tvcrlNnzaJ6IW3mkA&oe=653A73E3
instagram,"Co-parenting is not about being best friends, or about getting our own needs for fairness met or about seeking justice for the hurts,  but it can still thrive when rooted in mutuality and shared goals!✨

One thing I can be pretty sure about is that you all want is what is best for your kids. That's what truly matters—the well-being of your kids. Sometimes, it means letting go of certain things to reduce conflict or going the extra mile to ensure both parents are present.

The ultimate reward is a well-adjusted, safe, and secure child!

Here are some quick reminders for when you get triggered or overwhelmed to help you refocus on what’s most important: the kids.

💫 Prioritize the Kids: make decisions that benefit them.

🏆 Celebrate Wins: focus on what works, not what doesn't.

🤝 Collaborate: approach challenges as teammates, not adversaries.

💭 Change Mindset: swap ""It's not fair"" for ""How will this benefit my kids? How do I want them to feel?""

instagram,"The top military brass on Tuesday expressed deep concern about the adverse developments taking place in the Gaza-Israel conflict and the enormous human cost being imposed on innocent civilians due to the disproportionate use of force by Israel.

The concern was expressed during the 260th Corps Commanders’ Conference held at the General Headquarters (GHQ) Rawalpindi, where Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir extended “diplomatic, moral and political support of the Pakistani nation” to the principled stance of Palestinians, according to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).

instagram,"#MitchellHamline Professor Forrest Tahdooahnippah is presenting a CLE on Thursday (Oct. 26) at 4pm CST on the Law of Psychedelics

As drug policy and attitudes towards drug policy evolves, laws prohibiting the use of psychedelics are being reexamined. Several state and local governments have decriminalized the use of psychedelics. 

Industry is taking advantage of these shifting attitudes to apply for intellectual property protection for uses of psychedelics. However, the use of psychedelics implicates individual and religious freedoms in ways that have not previously been in conflict with intellectual property rights. 

Profs. Tahdooahnippah and Dustin Marlan of UNC School of Law will discuss these emerging issues and explore the ways that #psychedelics create new intersections in the law, not previously considered.
