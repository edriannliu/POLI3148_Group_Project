facebook,"‚ÄúI was born in New York in 1919. My grandparents had a farm up upstate, and that‚Äôs what I remember, camping out in the barn and going swimming in the local brook. I put up a teepee out in the cow pasture. I had to put a fence around it so the cows didn‚Äôt break it down. I was a big fan of Native Americans. Did you ever hear of Ernest Thompson Seton? He wrote books about Native Americans. He said, ‚ÄúIf you want to have role models, don‚Äôt go to Europe. Right here were men who were strong and women who were strong, and they cooperated. If there was food, everybody shared; if there was no food, everybody, including the chief and his family, were hungry.‚Äù And that seemed to be the way people should live.‚Äù ‚Äì Pete Seeger ‚ÄúPete Seeger did so much for the world through music, in ways both subtle and big. You know, heaven must be a great place, because there are a lot of people going there!‚Äù - Buffy Sainte-Marie Today is Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Day! Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Day is celebrated on the second Monday of October to honor the cultures and histories of the Native American people. With this in mind, let‚Äôs take a moment to celebrate Buffy Sainte-Marie! Buffy Sainte-Marie is a Canadian-American Cree singer-songwriter, musician, composer, visual artist, educator, pacifist and social activist. Throughout her career in all of these areas, her work has focused on issues of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Her singing and writing repertoire also includes subjects of love, war, religion, and mysticism. In 1997, Buffy founded the Cradleboard Teaching Project, an educational curriculum devoted to better understanding Native Americans. She has won recognition and many awards and honors for both her music and her work in education and social activism. Her 19th album, ‚ÄúMedicine Songs‚Äù (2017), features a mix of new material, such as ‚ÄúYou Got to Run (Spirit of the Wind),‚Äù a collaboration with Tanya Tagaq, and re-recorded older songs, including ‚ÄúStarwalker,‚Äù ‚ÄúLittle Wheel Spin and Spin‚Äù and ‚ÄúBury My Heart at Wounded Knee.‚Äù The album drew positive reviews and went on to win the 2018 Juno Award for Indigenous Music Album of the Year. Of the album, ‚ÄúNOW‚Äù magazine‚Äôs Michael Rancic wrote: ‚ÄúAnother artist might show signs of disappointment or uncertainty when faced with the notion that not much has changed in half a century, but on ‚ÄúMedicine Songs‚Äù, in the face of the unchanging nature of the oppression she‚Äôs expressed through her music, Buffy Sainte-Marie has chosen to be just as determined, unflinching and constant in her own art.‚Äù In the video below, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Tanya Tagaq perform ""You Got to Run (Spirit of the Wind)"". The song was written by Sainte-Marie and inspired by champion dogsled racer George Attla, who competed in the first-ever Iditarod dog sled race in 1973 and was the subject of the 1979 film, ‚ÄúSpirit of the Wind‚Äù. The film shows the life of George Attla as a young Athabaskan trapper living in the bush in Alaska and then in a TB sanitarium in town.

Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world.

facebook,"More than 48 hours after Hamas's invasion on October 7th, the IDF spokesman says although Israeli forces have regained control of all Gaza border towns, it‚Äôs still possible that some Hamas terrorists are still lurking inside the country. The IDF deployed four divisions to the south to expel Hamas operatives from Israeli soil. Israeli warplanes are carrying out widespread strikes on Hamas targets and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday ordered a ‚Äúcomplete closure‚Äù of the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Hamas continues to rain down rockets on southern and central Israel. The numbers reported since the conflict began are staggering. More than 4,000 rockets fired into Israel, as many as 700 Israelis murdered, almost 3,000 injured, many seriously‚Äîand about 100 kidnapped and taken into captivity in Gaza.

facebook,"Via Reuters: Israel pounded the Palestinian enclave of Gaza on Sunday, killing hundreds of people in retaliation for one of the bloodiest attacks in its history when Islamist group Hamas killed 700 Israelis and abducted dozens more. Hamas fighters' rampage through Israeli towns on Saturday was the deadliest such incursion since Egypt and Syria's attacks in the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago and has threatened to ignite another conflagration in the long-running conflict. In response, Israeli air strikes hit housing blocks, tunnels, a mosque and homes of Hamas officials in Gaza, killing more than 400 people, including 20 children, in keeping with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vow of ""mighty vengeance"". Appeals for restraint came from around the world, though Western nations largely stood by Israel while Iran, Hezbollah and protesters in various Middle Eastern nations lauded Hamas.

Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world.

facebook,"Palestine-Israel conflict has resumed in the Gaza Strip for the third day. As of Monday, October 9, the death toll on both sides soared over 1,200. Gaza-based Palestinian armed movement Hamas launched a military operation and fired thousands of rockets at Israel on October 7. The military operation caught Israel off guard, bringing heavy battles to Israel‚Äôs streets for the first time in decades. Hamas claimed the attack was a response to the recent escalating Israeli assaults in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as decades of atrocities against Palestinians. Israel pounded the Gaza Strip from Sunday night into Monday, and ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip, halting deliveries of food, fuel, and supplies to its 2.3 million Palestinians. Houses, apartment buildings, and mosques were all among the targets hit overnight. According to the UN, Israeli missiles also raided health facilities inside Gaza and UNRWA Schools. The death toll, including civilians, women, and children, is likely to rise by minutes as indiscriminate rockets continue due to the ongoing conflict. #PalestineIsraelConflict #Palestine #Israel #Gaza #GazaStripe #MiddleEast",,6478,"{'like_count': 2474, 'comment_count': 415, 'num_users': 121062286}",CGTN,,2023-10-09 20:23:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/240501168_398442308315914_1975708148483497397_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fqFJPm2ePcQAX_EttAj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmpHfEtK6PszswEM-kc4fo5ZDurnAeUaRWl6uD79W1bw&oe=655A1719,https://www.facebook.com/100044504436603/posts/967263098100496,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385893108_711411051033507_8755966542850386452_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EVOcvKgd1gMAX-90ntt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA_gjn6eIkLAEsoSxBcsmWxv_zDlBkRF-u30l2Q14Pl5w&oe=653506D8

facebook,"Joe Biden and his administration hold at least part of the blame for the situation in Israel and Palestine. His administration released $6 billion to Iran, a supporter of Hamas and his administration left $86 billion of weapons in Afghanistan during the botched withdrawal. For those who say that $6 billion can only be used for humanitarian purposes don‚Äôt be so foolish. They can simply divert whatever they had previously allocated for this purpose over to providing funding for more conflict. Trump warned that the $6 billion would lead to increased conflict back in September. The Biden administration knew full well that their actions both in Afghanistan and with Iran would further destabilise the region. The question now is why did they do it? There are no winners in war only losers and suffering. As an international community we need to do more to bring this conflict to an end and demand both sides sit at a negotiating table once and for all. We simply cannot allow it to continue.

facebook,"I‚Äôm posting anonymously because I feel very vulnerable sharing these feelings. I wonder if other women who have reached this stage in life feel similarly. I received a phone call from a family member very early in the morning while I was at work asking where I‚Äôve been, why I haven‚Äôt been answering my phone, and demanding that I call them back that evening. As I hung up the phone, all I could think was‚Ä¶. I am not available currently. I have a full time job. No. Career. My career is physically, emotionally, and mentally challenging. Which has been made ever more challenging by new state legislation that greatly affects education and educators. My mental load is heavy and I am not available currently, but I am doing my best. After working from 6:30am-4:30pm I go home to my second job which is being the full time caretaker of an ailing parent. A parent with Alzheimer‚Äôs Dementia and stage 3 lung cancer. Both of which require many appointments that must be managed along with daily care that is time consuming and increasing in demand daily‚Äîas is typical with a degenerative disease. I also work as her executor, communicating on her behalf with lawyers, financial consultants, and state aide representatives, trying to establish long term care options. So I am not available currently, but I am doing my best. In addition, I am a mother to a college age child who just moved in to an off campus apartment to begin her sophomore year,across the country, and whom I support, financially, emotionally and mentally. Helping her navigate adulthood and new responsibilities all long distance. I am also trying to handle the emotions that come with living so far from my only child. Missing her so much my arms ache in her absence. Figuring out who I am now that she isn‚Äôt living in my home. My heart aches and I am grieving this change. So I am not available currently, but I am doing my best. I am a wife to a loving and supportive husband who also works as an educator. Who‚Äôs career has also been been made more difficult in this current political climate. This man with whom I am redesigning a 24 year marriage around our newly empty nest. As his wife I work to support him as he takes care of a property that shelters our family and my ailing mother. So I am not available currently, but I am doing my best. I am a pet owner to three chosen animals plus one I am actively trying to rehome for a family member who no longer wanted her. I am walking and feeding and managing their care. I am cleaning up messes cause by conflict from our newest animal configuration. I struggle to keep them in separate areas of the house to keep the peace,which is an impossible task, since my mother‚Äôs dementia keeps her from remembering to keep doors closed. So I am not available currently, but I am doing my best. I am busy and tired. My mental load is so extreme, so heavy that I don‚Äôt have enough wiggle room to be available to anyone else right now. People ask me ‚Äúhow can I help‚Äù? Please don‚Äôt ask me. It just adds to my mental load. I don‚Äôt have the space to make any more decisions or to manage anyone else. Help would be wonderful if it came in the form of someone else figuring out ways to lesson my mental load, to free up some of my time, to take on some of my responsibilities so that I don‚Äôt have to think about it.

I remind myself that this journey was never meant to be easy. There are stones and sticks. There are steep ravines and lonely valleys. But my focus remains the same: Home. This world as we know it is temporary. It's not our home. The Scripture tells us in 1 John 2: 17, ""And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever."" So we journey towards home and something greater than we have ever known or seen. It is a home not made with human hands. It is a place of peace and rest, that will not decay or leave us disappointed. The Father will be there and is there, even now. He will greet us with a loving embrace when we arrive: ""Welcome Home, My Child.....Welcome Home.""

facebook,"Our most powerful response to the horror in Israel and Palestine is to refuse to surrender our humanity. You will be told by some: The deaths of Israeli children are unfortunate but inevitable, because Israel‚Äôs occupation of Palestine is brutal and wrong. You will be told by others: The deaths of Palestinian children are unfortunate but inevitable, because it is the only way to keep Israel safe from terror, and Hamas brought this on its own people. Both will say: Our aggression is the only response to their aggression, our fear more justified than their fear, our grief more devastating than theirs ever will be. But oh my love, the hierarchy of pain is the old way. The moment we allow our hearts to go numb is the moment we shut down our humanity. I don‚Äôt know the solution to the conflict in Israel and Palestine, but I do know the starting point: To grieve ‚Äútheir‚Äù children as our children. It‚Äôs the only way to break the cycle. To my loved ones who are Israeli, Jewish, and Palestinian: I see your searing pain. I love you and grieve with you and am reciting my ancestors‚Äô prayers for protection as you search for your families and bear the unbearable. May love find you through the impossible. To all of us witnessing this story: What does love want you to do? If you cannot look at the news and the images: It‚Äôs okay. Step away, be with the earth, go to the trees, let them breathe through you; remember that you don‚Äôt need to do all the things, just the one that‚Äôs yours to do. If you want to help but don‚Äôt know how: Begin in relationship. Who in your life is hurting from this? Offer to walk with them, listen to them. There is no fixing grief, only bearing it together. Only then do we know what to do next. If you are falling apart: Your breathlessness is not a sign of your weakness, but of your strength. Of how deeply you feel the horror, how deeply you care. You still feel. And that matters in a world that wants us to feel nothing. Who can feel it with you? breathe with you? Opening our hearts to grief‚Äî others and our own‚Äî is how we hold our humanity in a world that would destroy it. It‚Äôs how we will begin to survive this. #IsraelPalestine #SeeNoStranger",,3971,"{'like_count': 581, 'comment_count': 149, 'num_users': 55522}",Valarie Kaur,,2023-10-09 20:36:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/313012745_671809071004770_2689659559733411513_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=OTcIOgH0PSsAX-sno72&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBupMQc7DsYMEYlvZdFQ3W6d7sDIWTITaG2ZYYdOU8xog&oe=6559DAB6,https://www.facebook.com/100045270499959/posts/902205747965100,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385876466_902424757943199_4341056479990872631_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=FLVVbBeRe5kAX-rkHuE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBSPj4WW18rVzMAcaty6ylN0E4AT5N4SFfpYP9f4MzDrQ&oe=655A1D80

The two presidents agreed on the importance of urging all parties to immediately stop the confrontations and violence, and to avoid exposing civilians to further risks and loss of life, taking into account the need to protect civilians and secure humanitarian conditions suitable for their livelihood. The two presidents also stressed that permanently ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict comes through providing hope and political prospect, and implementing the two-state solution based on the approved terms of reference and the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy.",,3794,"{'like_count': 2380, 'comment_count': 480, 'num_users': 2379927}",ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ÿ≠ÿØÿ´ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸÖŸä ŸÑÿ±ÿ¶ÿßÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖŸáŸàÿ±Ÿäÿ©-Spokesman for the Egyptian Presidency,,2023-10-09 19:52:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/328441906_909358313530689_6753333129130148843_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eHjJH8VKXdcAX8FFJ6b&_nc_oc=AQkz-ovPXPjNN9FGHjcE2gTOdWr2EhnAkTFzoZEb-dmM1r1g7Q6z08gVYdu6pv5O7YY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfChrQ0doEGmYFJpwy4OpzBVrRwPE-ylfgG3fOXqiAQVew&oe=6559EF70,https://www.facebook.com/100044362122571/posts/884578129697583,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387743453_884577199697676_8530065294851727057_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=-FYad9_cJZ8AX__lTaH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDDbmelKWBaGx-wKJshtVTppFjxbc_VK4nMxYL_gK2I0A&oe=6529AE21

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel? Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world.

facebook,"Our friends in Israel are at war. Their enemies attacked the civilian population. They went into the homes of families and began to do horrific things. They've taken prisoners back from those, those communities along the Gaza Strip back into the strip. We have a biblical assignment to pray for the peace of Jerusalem. God gave that piece of land to the descendants of Abraham forever and I don't believe he has withdrawn that covenant just because the UN doesn't always smile. Over a thousand Israelis have been killed. More than 3000 rockets have been fired out of Gaza into those communities far beyond just surrounding Gaza. Two years ago we were celebrating historic peace accords across the Middle East. Israelis were being welcomed in places they had never been welcomed before. Today, the Taliban is in charge in Afghanistan. In the last few months, we've given $6 billion to Iran, an international sponsor of terrorism. It's not surprising that Hamas has the resources to launch an attack on Israel. We are funding it. We gave $6 billion to the Iranians. That's a destabilizing influence. The world is watching to see if the United States will stand with our ally. You should know that expressions of hatred for the Jewish people, antisemitism, and hatred for Christians are two sides of the same coin. They're all fueled by the spirit of the antichrist. It. That spirit hates the purpose of God breaking forth in the earth. So we're not just praying for an end to the military conflict between Hamas and the Israelis, we're praying that that spirit that would like to see them destroyed will be turned back.

facebook,"THE PALESTINE-ISRAEL CONFLICT 1. The reactions to the latest hostility between Palestinians and the Israelis actually underscores why the conflict, which has been more than seven decades, would not find a solution. 2. Firstly, the responses that came from powerful Western nations and their apparatus, including their media, are hypocritical, bigoted and pathological. 3. Instead of addressing the conflict for what it actually is, they chose to continue with their deceptive narrative that it is an attack on Israel by terrorists ‚Äì their blame being obviously against Hamas, the Hezbollah and Iran. 4. With that narrative, they stoke fear in the Western community, claiming that it is an attack on democracy and peace loving people. 5. With that, the US in particular feel justified to extend military support to Israel to ‚Äúretaliate‚Äù against Palestinians attacks. 6. All these are far from the truth. Instead they are outright lies which had been perpetuated unashamedly by Western leaders and their media. 7. The truth is actually very simple. 8. For decades, the Israelis had been committing war crimes, massacres, genocide and unthinkable atrocities against the Palestinians. 9. These are not one-off acts but rather systematically conducted without respite throughout the seven decades. 10. Apart from Palestinian land which the Israelis acquired illegally through unilateral agreements and treaties with former occupiers of Palestine, the Israeli settlers have been forcefully seizing lands and farms belonging to Palestinians. 11. The Palestinians are chased out of their land and any attempt to seek some form of restitution from the Israeli authorities are met with violence backed most times by the Israeli security forces namely the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). 12. The Palestinians, pushed to the corner, while Gaza was turned into an open air prison, attempted sporadic retaliations, which in turn were met with the full force of the IDF with weapons supplied by superpowers in particular the US. 13. This episode is not any different from previous retaliations except that probably this time around they are more focussed with a bit more assistance externally. 14. But the Western powers and their apparatus continue with their lies, with their narratives that the hostility is an act of terror committed by terrorists, ignoring the fact that it is retaliation by a people whose freedom and rights to their land had been forcefully taken away from them. 15. They refuse to view the hostility is committed by freedom fighters who are up against an injustice committed by an apartheid regime which had been perpetrating genocide on the Palestinians. 16. The Western powers and the US are party to apartheid, genocide and crimes against humanity for as long as they support the heinous Israeli regime. 17. With that, any attempt towards finding a just and fair solution for the Palestinians becomes an exercise in futility. 18. In the meantime, the Israelis can be expected to carry out their genocide with impunity and with total disregard of international laws.

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel? Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

facebook,"Venti Passed on His Gnosis #GenshinImpact THEORY Spoiler for the end of Fontaine Act 4. In this passage, I delve into some captivating theories and musings related to the enchanting world of Genshin Impact. Firstly, I suggest that Neuvillette's words might hold the key to a profound revelation: that gnoses could be the stolen powers of the sovereigns, those enigmatic beings in the game. I then build on this intriguing notion by proposing that Venti's recent lack of glowing hairtips could be due to him willingly giving up his elemental authority to Dvalin. This leads to the fascinating question of whether Dvalin might actually be the anemo sovereign in disguise, or perhaps a reincarnated version. I also speculate that the current sovereigns might be oblivious to their true identities, which raises questions about their connection to their dragonhood. Furthermore, I touch upon the enigma surrounding Dvalin's origin and existence in relation to Venti's reign as the anemo archon. Moving on, I ponder the stolen gnosis and its significance. I suggest that it might be a tangible entity capable of existing independently of the archons. To support this, I draw parallels to other gnoses that have been concealed in various locations like the Exuvia and the Akasha. Although there's speculation that the hydro gnosis might be hidden in the Oratrice, its actual existence remains uncertain. The uniqueness of the anemo gnosis grabs my attention. It appears to have been exclusive to Venti throughout history. I speculate that it could potentially be concealed within Mondstadt's Venessa tree, which I liken to the importance of the Akasha and the Oratrice. However, I acknowledge that this idea remains speculative, and the source of the gnosis's power to cleanse Venti remains a mystery begging to be unraveled. I round off this passage with a thought-provoking theory. I believe that Venti might have purposefully allowed Signora to steal an empty gnosis vessel. This bold move, I contend, could be a strategic ploy to placate Signora and deceive the Tsaritsa into thinking she has vanquished him, thereby removing him from the ongoing conflict. In summary, I share these imaginative theories and interpretations about Genshin Impact's complex lore. These ideas offer players like me captivating perspectives on the game's narrative and its intricate mysteries.",,2515,"{'like_count': 654, 'comment_count': 177, 'num_users': 78767}",Brodakin,,2023-10-09 08:00:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/278369036_497116125284567_4777938180795065408_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ZCAqWj8cYc0AX8feI-k&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCpj56QLUxC7ggbOrT_15uScp9975KxLhZXALZaLFRbVw&oe=655B7709,https://www.facebook.com/100049585521480/posts/909051094091066,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385782960_907612997568209_575638653207195434_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=J26H_3xuKRYAX82Zysa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDe1Mjhu-x_vTJeCRy9_JG-J9UKaugzX2QS6roDwDhYxg&oe=6529791D

facebook,"Beste vrienden, Hamas terroristen vermoordden koelbloedig meer dan 600 onschuldige burgers waaronder 260 jongeren op het ‚ÄòFestival voor de Vrede‚Äô in Isra√´l. Lang leve Hamas Om deze slachtpartij te ‚Äòvieren‚Äô komen duizenden mensen op straat, niet enkel in Teheran en de Gaza, maar ook in heel wat Westerse grootsteden waaronder Antwerpen, Toronto, Rotterdam en Washington. De stille steun is onpeilbaar. Haatzaaier Van pro-Isra√´lische betogingen geen spoor te bespeuren. Wie - zoals ik - w√©l zijn steun en solidariteit met het volk van Isra√´l in deze barre tijden - publiek uitspreekt, krijgt bakken bagger en wordt weggezet als ‚Äòpolariserende haatzaaier‚Äô. De wereld op haar kop. Zelf gezocht 40 jaar massamigratie heeft de publieke opinie in de West-Europese grootsteden volledig in het voordeel van Palestina laten kantelen. Isra√´l is de bron van al het kwade en alle Palestijnen zijn slachtoffers, Hamas incluis. Terreuraanslagen, raketinslagen en slachtpartijen worden massaal vergoelijkt en onder de ‚Äòzelf gezocht‚Äô-noemer geplaatst. Continent zonder grens Intussen blijven de Palestijnen massaal binnenkomen in ons continent zonder grens. En Belgi√´ is het land van melk en honing. De extreme anti-Isra√´l houding van communisten, socialisten en ecologisten zal er niet vreemd aan zijn. Palestijnen - ook de meest radicale elementen - zijn allen welkom. Onze asielkantoren draaien overuren. Stille verhuis Onze grote Joodse gemeenschap leeft al jaren onder politiebescherming. Toenemend antisemitisme en dagelijkse beschimpingen zijn hun deel. Velen trekken definitief weg uit onze pan-Arabische grootsteden. Na wat eergisteren gebeurde zal die stille verhuis enkel toenemen. Geopolitieke hegemonie Intussen blijven veel mensen blind voor wat er √©cht op het spel staat: de strijd om de geopolitieke hegemonie in het Midden-Oosten. Sinds de historische ‚ÄòAbraham-akkoorden‚Äô zijn de decennialange bevroren diplomatieke en economische relaties tussen Isra√´l en de Arabische wereld stap-voor-stap aan het ontdooien. De netelige Palestijnse kwestie verdwijnt naar de achtergrond. En dat pikken de terroristen van Hamas en Islamic Jihad met jodenhaat als belangrijkste handelsmerk, en hun hoofdfinancier en opdrachtgever Iran niet. Perzi√´ - Arabi√´ Vooral de laatste toenadering tussen Isra√´l en Saoudi-Arabi√´, het machtigste Arabische land in het Midden-Oosten en traditioneel sterke bondgenoot van Palestina, steekt de ogen in Teheran, Gaza en Hebron uit. Iran zal nooit toestaan dat de relaties tussen Isra√´l en Saoudi-Arabi√´ normaliseren omdat dit - in de eeuwenoude strijd tussen Perzen (Irani√´rs) en Arabieren - hen potentieel een te groot technologisch, economische en militaire nadeel oplevert. Terug in uw kot De extreem blinde en bloederige haat die we eergisteren zagen, heeft helemaal niet als hoofddoel een oplossing voor het conflict te bespoedigen. Laat staan ‚Äòde ogen van de wereld te openen‚Äô. Ze beoogt net het omgekeerde, het herinstalleren van de decennialange stellingenoorlog tussen Isra√´l en de rest van het Midden-Oosten en Noord-Afrika en het diplomatiek herisolement van Isra√´l. Terug in uw kot, quoi. Hiervoor rekenen ze op blinde wraak van Isra√´l. Of dit plan zal lukken, zal de komende weken moeten blijken. Ik hoop hartsgrondig van niet. Prettige dag, deel gerust, Theo PS: Vandaag verkiezing voor h√©t ondervoorzitterschap van de NAVO pa. Spannend. Duim je mee?

facebook,"The Ancient War Principles of the Dinka and Nilotics The Dinka, Nuer, and other Nilotic tribes, proud of their heritage, used to follow unwritten codes during traditional conflicts. Historically, these disputes were over territories, water sources, resources, and other factors that led to these confrontations. The essence of these battles wasn't merely about victory or demonstrating one's strength and bravery to the adversary. The operation had a restricted scope because no community wanted the other to be cleansed. Not all wars were intentional. None of the communities initiated an attack because they wanted to compare it to our present world. Whether the conflict involved individuals or entire communities, adherence to these codes was paramount. A notable practice among the Dinka was their aversion to surprise attacks, especially when combat was primarily with sticks or spears. If one were to ambush an adversary, the norm was to gently tap them on the shoulder, giving them a moment to recognise their attacker. This practice stemmed from the Ji…õÃà≈ã's deep-rooted belief that blindsiding an opponent was dishonourable. They held that such actions displeased the divine, potentially invoking a curse upon the perpetrator for harming an unsuspecting soul. Furthermore, there were strict prohibitions against harming the elderly, women, children, the frail, or even prisoners of war. While men might fall in battle, children were spared, ensuring the continuity of life and culture even amidst conflict. Once hostilities ceased, efforts were made to mend ties, with reparations and reconciliation processes initiated to foster harmony and coexistence. Sadly, these communities' rich traditions, values, and ethics face challenges today. I passionately hope the upcoming generations remember and cherish the profound values and norms that once defined our societies. #AjakDengChiengkou",,2167,"{'like_count': 1812, 'comment_count': 118, 'num_users': 288800}",Ajak Deng Chiengkou,,2023-10-09 16:07:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292301445_600369234777708_314554277581745466_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=oqpMHp-rIwUAX_ZB7BQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfANDhHxzKq2PnT3hC-89FSmT8vXUJD3-F5a85aQ07_rJQ&oe=655B3A5E,https://www.facebook.com/100044139114373/posts/878787350269227,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387753066_878787023602593_787050437572510609_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EFhsupTRvC8AX-OUj1O&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBbirmQ69ibJNWqMzp4sS8Z9agR8NwULohbyUmDkZjzrg&oe=655A9859

facebook,"On this day in 1956, America welcomed my dad (pictured center) and his family as Palestinian Christian refugees. It was the greatest blessing of his life. Born Attallah Amash in 1940, my dad had an extremely difficult childhood. He was a victim of war, expelled from his home at just eight years old in 1948, moving from place to place to find shelter and living off scraps. He never had new clothes except what was provided to him through charity. In the few years (on and off) that he was able to attend school, the other children didn‚Äôt want to associate with him. He couldn‚Äôt even play soccer with them because he didn‚Äôt have shoes. His father made him sell coffee and tea as a young boy just to make a few cents that his dad would take. The first time my dad had a decent meal was when a family member died (an uncle, who lived and died in a dog house) and neighbors delivered food in his memory. Even before the conflict, my dad‚Äôs family lived in abject poverty. His grandma, grandpa, aunt, and uncle died of starvation under Ottoman rule. They lived in horrendous conditions among rats. They were abused, uneducated, prone to superstitions, and struggled with mental illness. The Amash family‚Äôs misfortune turned into triumph when Rev. & Mrs. Ralph Wagoner (pictured right), of the Muskegon Church of the Brethren, made the sacrifice to sponsor them to come to the United States. The incredible generosity of the Wagoners gave new life to the Amashes. I‚Äôm forever grateful to the Wagoners for making my life in America possible. I‚Äôm forever grateful to America for opening its arms to poor refugees like my dad‚Äôs family. This story is why I so dearly love our Constitution, which defends life, liberty, and property. It‚Äôs why I wanted to serve in Congress: to support, with my voice and votes, the great principles that define America.

facebook,"The most fool-proof way to know when a person is cheating is a shift in their baseline temperament. That is, a deviation from their normal behaviour in situations. Every couple knows their expected range of expression. How calm they are in normal circumstances, how they behave when angry or anxious, how they interact when there's tension between them. There is a rhythm to their energy when it's the two of them. But the moment a third person is plugged into the matrix, there will be a shift. The cheating person will experience guilt, and they will need to offset it. If they think of their partner as loving and committed, they will feel immense guilt for cheating on a person who is so good and loyal. So, to reduce this guilt, they must exaggerate the partner's weaker qualities to get some justification for cheating. They will overreact to things and prolong conflict more than usual. They will one disagreement to explain a lot of change in their own behaviour. The truth is that they're y're trying to convince themselves, not you. Alternatively, they will become inexplicably nice in an attempt to 'make it up for you.' They will seem happier and more excited without any reason. Nobody can perfectly balance these two experiences. Your solution is to stop focusing on the theatrics in the house. When you see strange behaviour, always look behind the person. You can't confront too soon because they'll just gaslight you and cover their tracks better. You have to contain yourself and fish for solid evidence, usually something around their communications or unexplained leave of absence. But remember you must be prepared to deal with a potential end of this relationship. If you don't know what you can do in case you confirm your fears, you will avoid digging. The problem will get worse and swallow your health and well-being. The first rule for a healthy relationship is to always marry life before you marry anyone so that your life will never depend on the one you marry. That is, learb to live on your own first so that those who get to live with you don't think they are your life. People cheat with impunity when they think you can't go anywhere. The moment they know you'll just shut them out at once, they will think twice before playing you. In essence, you maintain a healthy marriage by not needing it as a matter of life and death.

facebook,"In this life we must meet fiery trials and make costly sacrifices, but the peace of Christ is the reward. There has been so little self-denial, so little suffering for Christ's sake, that the cross is almost entirely forgotten. We must be partakers with Christ of His sufferings, if we would sit down in triumph with Him on His throne. So long as we choose the easy path of self-indulgence, and are frightened at self-denial, our faith will never become firm, and we cannot know the peace of Jesus, nor the joy that comes through conscious victory. The most exalted of the redeemed host that stand before the throne of God and the Lamb, clad in white, know the conflict of overcoming, for they have come up through great tribulation. Those who have yielded to circumstances rather than engage in this conflict, will not know how to stand in that day when anguish will be upon every soul, when, though Noah, Job, and Daniel were in the land, they could save neither son nor daughter, for everyone must deliver his soul by his own righteousness.""

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel? Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

facebook,"My heart goes out to all the victims and their families of the current escalation of this ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Social media is not a place for nuanced discussions or complicated issues, so I usually try to keep my thoughts to when I can actually have real meaningful conversation with people face to face. However, yesterday‚Äôs attack by the Hamas militants is something we haven‚Äôt seen yet. Perhaps because Hamas was never as successful as this, or perhaps just because violence and cruelty have a way of escalating where civility is allowed to erode. Even in the surreal status quo of bloodshed and despair that we have gotten used to over the many years of conflict, there seemed to be some general rules, which have been finally crushed yesterday morning. This was not just an indiscriminate rampage of violence. This was a planned and systematic slaughter, targeting helpless civilians‚Ä¶ babies, children and elderly included, followed by the cheering and the abuse of the paraded bodies in Gaza‚Äôs streets. The videos circulating in social medias are something that should send shivering chills in any beating human heart. They certainly have kept me up in a strange, numbing tempest of horror tonight. And while, of course there is a context for everything, and I am on the side that truly believes that the Palestinian people deserve to have their own governance and freedom, no context or ideal in the world can justify these actions. Moreover, I know as well as anyone, that these horrific acts of bloodlust and brutality only lead to a circle of retaliation and violence and loss. It saddens me, and despairs me. I wish I could say that distance makes it easier. But my heart truly shatters at the level of cruelty and inhumanity of the past two days.

facebook,"10ID awards medal to soldier who apprehends a snatcher in Tagum City MAWAB, Davao De Oro - Private First Class Junnel M Perdido, a soldier of the 10th Installation and Management Battalion (10IMB), was awarded the Bronze Cross Medal during the Monday Flag Raising Ceremony held at Camp General Manuel T. Yan Senior in Mawab, Davao De Oro on October 9, 2023. PFC Perdido fearlessly pursued a snatcher who stole the wallet of Mrs. Lorife Ulep, containing P30,000.00 as payment for her daughter's hospital bill at Aquino Hospital, Tagum City, on September 28. PFC Perdido's heroic act did not involve actual conflict but rather a life-threatening risk as he chased and apprehended the snatcher hiding in a nearby village despite the potential danger. Brigadier General Allan D Hambala, Acting Commander of the 10th Infantry (Agila) Division, personally pinned the medal on PFC Perdido and subsequently commended his heroism and dedication to duty. In an interview, Mr. Efren Ulep, the victim's husband, expressed his gratitude for PFC Perdido's heroism. ""Mabuti sir at may tumulong. Hindi na man siya duty diba, pero si sir (referring to PFC Perdido) ginamit niya ang sinumpaan niya,"" Mr. Ulep said in vernacular. PFC Perdido is a member of the Morale and Welfare Recovery Center of the 10IMB under the Operational Control of the 10ID. He was at the hospital with his pregnant wife and daughter for a medical check-up while on leave. #StrongerArmyStrongerCountry #AgilaNewsNetwork #AgilaTroopers",,1874,"{'like_count': 992, 'comment_count': 59, 'num_users': 152571}","10th Infantry ""Agila"" Division, Philippine Army",,2023-10-09 10:27:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/365565760_676752461143235_4175214130159810758_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=UvP6j01P_6cAX-qK7ke&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA3qnr1smDhfnF5ZPlOFEgvC8Wged8lAEEWmFKcglP6bw&oe=655A39E9,https://www.facebook.com/100064254626718/posts/712871214198026,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387796879_712860994199048_2623956742444403216_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=F88BnBy_ZooAX8s3rpX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA91jZsSU25ECKNzC5e5V6wyMDJWk2OJvHIAELtZyIdrQ&oe=6553098E

facebook,"Please read the following update from Daniel Pierce about some of the ways we have been able to help in Israel right now: Earlier today, Max Voloshin went out to purchase groceries for displaced families from southern communities in Israel. (Max is one of our employees and our building manager in Jerusalem.) We also donated groceries to an organization that distributes food to the IDF soldiers who are currently amassed on Israel‚Äôs borders in preparation for the conflict over the coming days and weeks. We have opened up our home, and the Glory of Zion Jerusalem Ministry Center to accommodate families from the south who need to take shelter outside of the Gaza area. We are so blessed to have the Ministry Center and home in Jerusalem to serve the community in this way. When Max arrived to stock our home with groceries, the alarm sirens went off in Jerusalem. Max and his girlfriend took shelter in our safe room and counted ten explosions over the city. This was the second rocket attack on Jerusalem today. Tel Aviv also had rockets this morning.

But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel? Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

facebook,"Palestine-Israel conflict has resumed in the Gaza Strip for the third day. As of Monday, October 9, the death toll on both sides soared over 1,200. Gaza-based Palestinian armed movement Hamas launched a military operation and fired thousands of rockets at Israel on October 7. The military operation caught Israel off guard, bringing heavy battles to Israel‚Äôs streets for the first time in decades. Hamas claimed the attack was a response to the recent escalating Israeli assaults in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as decades of atrocities against Palestinians. Israel pounded the Gaza Strip from Sunday night into Monday, and ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip, halting deliveries of food, fuel, and supplies to its 2.3 million Palestinians. Houses, apartment buildings, and mosques were all among the targets hit overnight. According to the UN, Israeli missiles also raided health facilities inside Gaza and UNRWA Schools. The death toll, including civilians, women, and children, is likely to rise by minutes as indiscriminate rockets continue due to the ongoing conflict. #PalestineIsraelConflict #Palestine #Israel #Gaza #GazaStripe #MiddleEast",,1068,"{'like_count': 197, 'comment_count': 65, 'num_users': 166635}",PandaPaws,,2023-10-09 20:22:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312147233_487929943381620_7168779904564889165_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=o9qa7qQsuT4AX8IfWJ3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBNPHsdZ2GqsXbdm_3PmvC-0uwc-tyPbq89CiMVheilQg&oe=655AB115,https://www.facebook.com/100064938556454/posts/711411951033417,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385893108_711411051033507_8755966542850386452_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=lSXqYTcY7VoAX9ni0-P&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAADP6UEg65wuG4KE7FnfSwMP1CXpUQf35EAUU7diVLbg&oe=65292958

facebook,"Living in multicultural Australia means I‚Äôm exposed directly to the heartbreaking stories of ethnic conflict from all corners of the world. Without having the livid experience of being those people and sharing that history, there is only so much I can understand about their deep rooted personal and historical desire to fight for or defend what they see as their homeland. As an individual I‚Äôm sympathetic to my friends from around the world and think how blessed we are to be in a country that shows our differences have very little to do with how we can all live together in peace. Living in Australia also means that we are a part of civilised society that condemn acts of savagery and barbarism. We have our own moral and ethical aspirations to be people who despite the conflict, value human life, especially the protection of innocent civilian life at all times. Even when our own nation fails to meet these standards we condemn it and seek to hold our own accountable. It is shameful that there are those in my country, including political parties, movements and their leaders who are unable to rise to this standard today. If you are standing in solidarity with the savagery of directly slaughtering civilians, the parading of mutilated corpses, the hostage taking and rape of women and children as acceptable forms of resistance and defence, please think long and hard about what you are endorsing. It is worrying that so many here in Australia that are not linked to this conflict by ethnicity or history are unable to be rational and think clearly during a time like this. If we also rise to the depths of an eye for an eye bloodlust that excuses acts of savagery against innocents, there is not a hope in the world for the people directly impacted by those conflicts.",,1010,"{'like_count': 532, 'comment_count': 248, 'num_users': 267465}",Rukshan Fernando,,2023-10-09 01:29:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/244189011_307071767890934_2075114747603308362_n.jpg?stp=c0.8.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mAM2Fwame-wAX9Ci5S4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAVRWlzGwX2jwPRS-4PiSyMmBOv7krAO8EQspUgkIHpoQ&oe=655B74CB,https://www.facebook.com/100057643382196/posts/763207365610703,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387752564_17995004453329320_1381320307411613231_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=GJupoMkwxQEAX9y98fJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfByfBT1xi0FDCIrMw_QOJewwzWEMekTJ-wV1WnclJ7Qug&oe=65297371

After hours of intense bombardment by Israeli jets, Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza, said it would execute an Israeli captive for every Israeli bombing of a civilian house without warning. üîó Read the latest developments on the war between Israel and Hamas at our link in bio. üì∑ Hadas Parush #Reuters #topstories #topnews #Israel #Israelis #Hamas #Palestinians #Palestinianterritories #Palestinian #conflict #Gaza #IsraelGaza #war",,988,"{'like_count': 245, 'comment_count': 394, 'num_users': 7174549}",Reuters,,2023-10-09 21:37:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/278570575_389433443047394_5275384003700696944_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=zv6fKplAJ3YAX-j1Qof&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDfGk4KxmwMV2Rd1W-aKj0lfPuLLqkEMvFzuwbk1gkQWg&oe=655AE0F1,https://www.facebook.com/100059422245844/posts/804363564887711,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387753970_18386804008030639_1119707321527081656_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=eEmAGVKseM4AX87mpjV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBEWQ_PE5lZSsVCAnGISuqyCa_zV132XdAjCbkyO4vrjA&oe=6529A37D
facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel? Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world.

This significant milestone fills our hearts with pride and gratitude, marking a journey of resilience, unity, and the unwavering spirit of our people. This year's Fiji Day theme, ""Rebuilding Fiji Together,"" reflects not only our aspirations but also the indomitable spirit that has guided us through the years. It underscores our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder, forging a brighter future for all Fijians. Today, I wish to expand upon this theme, intertwining it with a vision that transcends our national borders - the ""Pacific Zone of Peace."" Recently, I had the privilege of representing our beloved Fiji at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. There, on the global stage, we introduced the concept of the ""Pacific Zone of Peace"" as our Blue Pacific's invaluable contribution to global order. This vision embodies the very essence of our commitment to peace, mutual respect, and unity in our region. The ""Pacific Zone of Peace"" is rooted in the fundamental values of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence. It calls for the nurturing and enhancement of international cooperation, inviting nations to collaborate on areas of common interest. In an ever-changing world, it reminds us of the power of unity and our shared responsibility to create a better future. We, in the Pacific, face unique challenges. The threats of climate change loom large, casting a shadow over our islands and communities. Rising sea levels, frequent cyclones, and the displacement of our people are daily reminders of the urgency to address this crisis. It is in these trying times that the ""Pacific Zone of Peace"" becomes not just an aspiration but a lifeline - a call for global solidarity in the face of environmental challenges that threaten our very existence. Today, as we celebrate our independence, we are reminded that peace is not only the absence of conflict but also the presence of cooperation and understanding among our people. In our multicultural society, peace serves as the cornerstone that nurtures unity and drives progress. It empowers us to harness the collective strength of our diverse backgrounds, cultures, and traditions. In our rapidly developing nation, peace is the catalyst for innovation, investment, and economic growth. It attracts partners and investors who recognise the stability and potential of a peaceful Fiji. It equips us to confront the challenges of climate change and global disruptions with resilience and determination. Our commitment to the ""Pacific Zone of Peace"" reinforces our dedication to fostering regional and global collaboration.

Just a few weeks ago, I had the privilege of walking alongside Ofir. He spoke with passion about the region he loved so profoundly. He had grand dreams for Shaar Negev ‚Äî from elevating student life at Sapir College to catalyzing growth in local businesses, hi-tech ventures, and agriculture. More than just infrastructure, Ofir imagined a community thriving beyond the shadows of conflict. He was determined not to let the terrorists from Gaza dictate his residents' quality of life. Furthermore, he hoped to build bridges with the people of Gaza. He recognized many there who desired progress. He was clear in his stance: not to cooperate with Hamas, a terror organization, but to establish direct connections with the Gaza residents he saw as victims of Hamas. While we didn't always agree on every nuance, I deeply respected his vision and commitment. He was a true patriot, both for his community and the nation. After departing from the corporate realm, Ofir poured his heart and soul into these dreams. The heartbreak is palpable, knowing he won't witness these dreams realized. He had set his sights on retirement in 5 years, aiming to immerse himself in educating young Jews globally, fostering their connection to Israel. Although he won't be able to fulfill this dream himself, I am resolute in my commitment to ensuring his story and ideals resonate worldwide, perpetuating his legacy. Ofir, your impact was profound. You'll be profoundly missed by all fortunate enough to have known you. You were a hero throughout your life, and in your final moments, you bravely protected your people.",,923,"{'like_count': 429, 'comment_count': 56, 'num_users': 8509}",Dan Illouz -  ◊ì◊ü ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ñ,,2023-10-09 00:52:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/274643628_356199893179724_2102709475646295708_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ezRy7h6I9EIAX9aDrZj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB1GUd-laCliVTLMZCsylZ6yiXc7G1oFKUB1j-ly52_YA&oe=655B33BB,https://www.facebook.com/100063691490100/posts/828529099280132,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387766799_828528709280171_720474505911744972_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nrOAHWUlvdsAX8TrFtT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDjc6tpe6spiliDW7lhpu9AjsaOXbA2AgucptvKbW4_1A&oe=655AE75C

facebook,"Watching in horror the brutal massacre, kidnappings, murder and torturing of innocent civilians in Israel by Hamas, a terrorist organisation determined to kill Jews and abolish the state of Israel. I‚Äôve been amazed by how little empathy or even acknowledgment people have shown to what‚Äôs been going on. Somehow condemning terror that‚Äôs directed at children, women and old ladies is ok if the victims are Israeli, or is it Jews? I forget. And yea, you can totally be critical of Israel‚Äôs government (past and current), their policies and actions over the years, and support the Palestinian people‚Äôs right to freedom and land (I do too) without being antisemitic, but if you say nothing against this horror and somehow find ways to justify it, then chances are that you ARE antisemitic whether you realise it or not. Jews around the world are being targeted as we speak. People who have no contact with Israel, some have never even visited and are unable to impact its politics, today walk in fear. Why is that?! The inability to separate between Jews and the Israeli government IS antisemitism and is as damaging as the inability to separate between the Palestinian people and Hamas. It‚Äôs a result of ignorance and I urge anyone who feels ‚Äúconfused‚Äù (I‚Äôve heard that word several times over the past few days) to educate themselves. I‚Äôve written an article about the Middle East conflict for those who want to learn more and I‚Äôve linked in my bio, but beyond the analytical understanding of the situation, I urge you to not forget your humanity. Hamas has kidnapped toddlers. TODDLERS. Are they to blame for Israel government‚Äôs injustices? Are we saying that it‚Äôs ok to rape and kill in some situations? Condemning Hamas does not mean ignoring the Palestinians‚Äô suffering. Over the years they have lost many lives including innocent children and women and every single one of them was a tragic loss. If we are able to say that about them then we should be able to say the same about Israeli children. Regardless of our politics.

facebook,"Heads up to our leaders in the National Task Force To End Local Communist Armed Conflict-NTF ELCAC: CPP urban operative Neri Colmenares is in Canada now launching another attack against the Philippine Government. His vicious cycle of spewing lies against our country and our people includes the narrative that former Pres. Rodrigo Duterte ordered the mass killings of 12,000 to 30,000 civilians in his brutal war on drugs; and that this impunity of wanton execution of civilians, activists and human rights defenders continues to be as pervasive as it was before, now under the present administration. This is classic international network operations of communist terrorist organization (the so called ""CPP INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WORK or ISW) that they establish international alliances like this Colmenares' series of community dialogue and speaking engagements in Canada, where he engages even some Canadian Senators, Canadian Non-government organizations-- like the C√≤tedes-Neiges Community Resource Center (a CPP communist NGO network thru Communist Partyof Canada); Filipino communities and expatriates group. Finance generation and fund raising as well as so called ""international solidarity groups and support network"" in Canada are also being established, especially that there is now an active CPP Country Party Committee in Canada, as a lot of CPP Urban Cadre Operators are being deployed now in Canada and in Europe and the US to augment and sustain the CPP International Terrorist Network operations. Colmenares is using Philippine issued passport but he scandalously attacks our government... the very Philippine Government that guarantees his right to travel abroad in order for him to do his tasks and mission in abroad, as a CPP active urban operative with the ultimate objective of advancing the agenda of cpp-npa-ndf, a designated terrorist organization.... and remains as the leading destroyer of our country and our people for over 50 years already. Our government needs to level-up its law enforcement, legal offensives and international as well as diplomatic mission programs in order to address these pervasive international terrorist network operations of the cpp-npa-ndf and their collaborators, conspirators, as well as their urban operatives.",,788,"{'like_count': 554, 'comment_count': 109, 'num_users': 67028}",Jeffrey ‚ÄúKa Eric‚Äù Celiz-SAMBAYANAN,,2023-10-09 21:20:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/350254685_1068326454145094_5143332060408028245_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=W3jLemca7DQAX8WKGMI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCl0KiZWoeAWZyNX9VzbIcjUZU0c0KL50S9PDRe-mIRLg&oe=655AA445,https://www.facebook.com/100068826768781/posts/627711459533074,

facebook,"Today, the CWC unanimously resolved to conduct a nationwide caste census when we come to power in the Centre, as well as to conduct it in every INC-ruled state. As Sh. Rahul Gandhi ji stressed in his press conference, the push for a caste census is not based on narrow political calculations, but a deep commitment to uplift India's backward communities. We are fully dedicated to the social justice agenda - to understand the true extent of deprivation faced by SC, ST and OBCs, so that a new development paradigm can be unlocked for India's poor. Further, we will lift the 50% cap on reservations for SC/ST/OBCs and remove all obstacles to ensure OBC women also get reservation within the 33% quota. The CWC also addressed other pressing issues that deserve public attention: 1. We expressed our condolences to the people of Sikkim and North Bengal who suffered from the devastating flash floods and demanded these floods as well as HP's flash floods as national disasters. 2. The Modi government's brutal attack on journalism and free speech will not intimidate us and they must realise that voices against them will only grow louder. 3. Even after 5 months, the Manipur crisis finds. nosign of resolution and the State as well as Central Government have totally failed in restoring peace in the region. 4. Household savings have plummeted because of the BJP's economic mismanagement that has caused historic levels of unemployment and price rise. 5. The conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing and a ceasefire is the need of the hour.

The embassy added that it aims to implement the indefinite suspension of travel until the situation is stable. Presently, the Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel remains operational for travel, including to and from the Philippines. However, possible flight cancellations may occur during the said conflict. Over the weekend, the Palestinian militant group 'Hamas' hit Israel with a suprise attack resulting to a present death toll of over 1,000 individuals, 2 Filipinos injured along with thousands wounded in both countries.

facebook,"I love (love!!) this quote by Sharon Peykar, LCSW ‚Äî go follow her for more! I often talk about people-pleasing isn‚Äôt really about pleasing people; it‚Äôs how we learned to stay physically, emotionally, or socially safe. But this coping mechanism we learned in the past wreaks havoc on our relationships in the present. Ultimately, people-pleasing‚Äôs inevitable consequences‚Äîyears‚Äô worth of resentment, avoidance, conflict aversion, and unspoken grievances‚Äîinhibit us from truly connecting with the very people we care about. They also prevent others from knowing who we really are. True intimacy requires that we release our stronghold on this outdated coping mechanism. It requires that we share the depths of our own passions and dreams. It demands that we are honest about what we feel and need, even when it‚Äôs hard. Ultimately, accepting the invitation to intimacy means bringing more self to our relationships after years of bringing less. THIS Thursday, October 12, join me at my new talk, Using Fierce Compassion to Stop People-Pleasing and Start Being Real, where we‚Äôll discover how we leverage our natural care and compassion for others as tools to break the people-pleasing pattern once and for all.

facebook,"""2. NEVER FORCE CHILDREN TO SHARE: We may wish young children would share, but it‚Äôs an unrealistic expectation. Model sharing as often as you can and support your child on their journey ‚Äì they‚Äôll learn sharing can be a rewarding social experience but they need to get there on their own timeframe. To model sharing toys specifically, Pam Leo suggests you can buy your own set of toys and keep them in a special place to share with your children or those who come to visit. But, give your child the freedom to decide if certain toys are off limits to others, never to be shared. Adults have this freedom and it‚Äôs fair for children to have it too. When friends come to visit, suggest ‚Äúteddy can sleep in a special place‚Äù to avoid potential conflict.""",,751,"{'like_count': 446, 'comment_count': 21, 'num_users': 359322}",Raised Good,,2023-10-09 06:15:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292966871_630524828634447_3186432501488337256_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8K6j-JmF98EAX_auSrE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDdltpaeBBDbURcwNk8wtsRkdNA2dQswHOtzns9LjC_ow&oe=655AAEB6,https://www.facebook.com/100050308067025/posts/927263872293873,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/8348601865064390001?url=http%3A%2F%2Fraisedgood.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F05%2Frespectful_parenting-min.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=raisedgood.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbFPj1nq0sW-Yf9A0d9ZvnAyOzPSIx9YLcfjJoAIahxrJg&oe=6546A811

facebook,"‚ÄúFor the first time in decades, Israel called the conflict with Palestinians a state of war. But for Palestinians, being at war is an enduring reality that has shaped their daily lives for the past seven decades. Since the Palestinian Nakba in 1948, which resulted in the forcible displacement of 750,000 Palestinians from their towns and villages, successive Israeli governments have committed hundreds of human rights violations, including ethnic cleansing, apartheid, and mass killings, all of which amount to war crimes according to international law. While Palestinians have long said that Israel‚Äôs practices are part of a war waged against their very existence, Israel has managed to get away with its violations, enjoying complete impunity that has lasted for more than 75 years. At 6.30am on Saturday, residents in Gaza were abruptly awakened by the sound of explosions reverberating through the blockaded Strip. By this time, it was not another Israeli military assault; rather, it was barrages of Palestinian homemade rockets launched towards several towns and cities in Israel. While the attack is described as ‚Äòsurprising‚Äô by many, an escalation of events was undoubtedly expected, given Israel‚Äôs tightening of restrictions and the rise in assaults across the occupied Palestinian territories during the past few months. This rise in Israeli military and settler brutality signifies an unprecedented level of violence across all the Palestinian territories, fueled and encouraged by a troubling sense of impunity and a lack of accountability for those responsible. Residents of Gaza have been talking of a fresh escalation since the early months of 2023: those discussions became ever more prominent both during and following each Israeli surge in violence in the occupied territories. And for them, the attack by Palestinian armed factions against Israel this weekend was not so much a surprise in concept as in scale and nature, both of which were unprecedented in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.‚Äù ‚úç: Maha Hussaini * Views expressed in this column belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of MEE",,698,"{'like_count': 388, 'comment_count': 64, 'num_users': 1921391}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-09 09:30:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/291028422_410373144459463_4151778888964342317_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=L1wHiXsOmuAAX_kDcgS&_nc_oc=AQl7Cxb6m4E9oWWRaloZ7VPqwBvyKZPvKffsiwmDWPSw9jL9lWoagfjiwVjGa9XoJfw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBef7B_qtzmlJDR_6rsQa6JMwcf30uorWT7fdel2xySVA&oe=655AEB02,https://www.facebook.com/100064603425232/posts/725151929648248,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387746226_725151436314964_4795671482146731587_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bc5u7gr-xn0AX_TnKNr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCXkdoMmnlVX90BBsjR80pI0EuRoghmGi5UQaYQ-9wbPA&oe=65574967

facebook,"Mantra recitation is very useful. We should recite mantras instead of indulging in our usual mundane, ridiculous chatter, which neither helps nor benefits us. Useless speech merely results in conflict. As we engage in useless, mundane, worldly speech, at the same time, we visualize. Words create pictures; words symbolize existent phenomena. So, whenever we converse, we‚Äôre visualizing a kind of hallucinated picture of the world. That automatically brings a conflicted reaction. So mantra is very useful, especially the very powerful Guru Shakyamuni mantra, TADYATHA OM MUN√â MUN√â MAHA MUNAY√â SOHA. When you recite mantras, your mind is automatically integrated rather than split. Furthermore, your speech becomes blessed and positive. To put it simply, since the time of our birth up until now we‚Äôve been living under the influence of a disordered mental imagination. Everything we see is through that lens and it brings the reaction of further mentally disordered imagination. Whatever we visualize in the world brings more confusion and disorder into our mind. Our speech and our actions also contribute to this and it all conspires to bring us down; our entire everyday life is brought down, torn down, like this. It‚Äôs so simple. The whole thing is just our own samsaric trip. So when we recite mantra we bring ourselves up a bit, we get ourselves together rather than destroying ourselves all the time. The meaning of mantra is profound, and mantra itself is in the nature of supreme wisdom energy rather than having delusion as its source. With mantra, our mind‚Äôs vision is positive, divine and holy, and our speech transcends ordinariness or useless conversation, becoming tranquil and healing. When we chant the prayers we do, it‚Äôs not just for the emotional sensations they might bring. Take, for example, the lamrim prayer the ùòçùò∞ùò∂ùòØùò•ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØ ùò∞ùòß ùòàùò≠ùò≠ ùòéùò∞ùò∞ùò• ùòòùò∂ùò¢ùò≠ùò™ùòµùò™ùò¶ùò¥. When we recite it, we bring to mind its essence, the three principal aspects of the path to liberation. That‚Äôs what it signifies. When we recite it, we automatically visualize its meaning, which displaces the usual garbage that normally fills our mind and brings a negative reaction. It automatically elevates our mind. So prayers are not just the words or something we sing simply to experience some kind of emotional pleasure. It‚Äôs possible we sometimes do that, isn‚Äôt it? If we allow our minds to degenerate, we can finish up using prayers merely for the sentimental pleasure of a samsaric trip. If we lose their profound essence, they become completely devoid of meaning. Doing that, we transform a deeply meaningful thing into kaka.[1] If, instead, we recite prayers and mantras with a profound understanding of their incredible meaning, our minds can transcend their normal worldly existence and attain a state of bliss. So, such recitations are very, very useful. What happens when we recite mantras is that our speech is slowly, slowly rectified until finally our speech itself becomes mantra‚Äîour speech becomes mantra and our mind becomes mantra as well. Normally we think that for our speech to become profound, to attract people, what we say depends on the words we use and nothing else. We think, ‚ÄúIn order to get people to listen to me and to attract others, I need to have a fantastic vocabulary and a great delivery.‚Äù But I say it‚Äôs not just the words we use that attracts others. The words help a bit, but besides the words, beyond the words, there‚Äôs some force, or power, that makes other people take interest in what we‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs not just the words. So, what I‚Äôm saying is that when through recitation of mantra we attain a certain state; whatever we say becomes like a mantra. It‚Äôs possible. Automatically, whatever sound you make is a divine reflection and gives others a positive vibration. It becomes a mantra. Possible. Anyway, your speech becomes very powerful. The Mahayana tradition holds that by reciting millions of mantras you can purify yourself to where you suddenly get a flash of telepathic power and can almost see the whole world right there in front of you. You can‚Äôt believe it! That kind of thing can happen. Also, you can read others‚Äô minds. All that is possible. üôè Lama Yeshe gave this teaching at Manjushri Institute, Cumbria, England, in 1976.

facebook,"I think a large part of my discontent is the lack of thought in reactions and responses to Trek. It used to be something you could nerd out about because there was story and canon most took the time to study and discuss. Now a days it's labeled and dismissed casually. Safe example: Janeway stated in the premiere of the series that they were stranded with no way to resupply that they had a finite amount of weapons and materials. In the first season it was established that Voyager required regular maintenance and upkeep to keep going. While under warp they had to cut back on energy intensive activities, if they wanted to use the replicator w/o limits they had to be out of warp. Any major repairs they had to park the ship on a planetary body. Within those constraints they could resupply their weapons, build shuttlecraft, and do major repairs ,.... to a point. After the third or so time that someone who wasn't paying attention sneered about Voyager having more photon torpedoes, or having an unlimited amount of shuttlecraft, it just kills the buzz on enjoying a series with others. Almost ALL of Trek has underlying reasons for why things are the way they are. Most ""plotholes"" or ""bad writing"" is usually just not understanding what was being depicted. I say ""most"" because things like Tuvix happened. Over two hundred years on data about transporters, four clear examples on how to resolve bringing back Tuvok and Neelix without killing Tuvix, and the writers when for drama and conflict. I miss being able to talk w/o someone trolling the subject.",,607,"{'like_count': 369, 'comment_count': 155, 'num_users': 95936}",Star Trek Voyager Fan Group,,2023-10-09 20:09:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/39242334_1775910832464587_5356468978602475520_n.jpg?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=wZBpkeW0hYMAX8HcdG_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAk82DzFpbBqMjYSmKstcR78SSytMR9qVqQx3bvTIznpA&oe=657D322D,https://www.facebook.com/groups/237243726708281/permalink/1779191559180149,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387806438_10231636754889803_1670744692023622400_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=BvMAbIXT6r8AX8_vxmW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA9RbKr-YW0XpK1CkMuSMys3ddf9oVLdbX8T88ChNTiuA&oe=652E2D2A

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel? Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

Even I support Palestinian cause and people since ages against the IsraHell government and illegal Israeli settlers occupation , I don't support violence and terrorism acts from both side. Especially when innocent people are victims. And all my thoughts and feelings for all victims of the raid from Hamas against Israel this weekend, as I usually for Palestinian people killed by IDF. Even if all victims matter, a special thought for people who were killed, injured, raped or kidnapped at the trance festival @super nova festival. ( 260 dead bodies found at the festival, about 150 kidnapped ... üñ§üñ§ Especially because the electronic scene use to spread values of peace and unity, with no matter of origins, color of skin, sexual orientation, genre, religion, territory... Why this Hamas attacked them, what was the purpose? While many of attendees of the festival were pro-palestinian,... Why??? üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢ How can we blame bad actions from Israeli soldiers, when they kill kids and raped women from Palestine, if you cannot blame the Hamas for the same? It makes a big difference when you bomb a place from a rocket and rushing into a festival and killing people with riffles, raping, and taking them?

facebook,"# The 10:10 Portal Opening sangeetahanda.net Number 10 in celestial gematria signifies God's Authority, Completeness, God's Order, and Divine Perfection. Now, lets begin with a Soul. A Soul is an emergence of God. Or simply explained, an extension of God in outward manifestation. The Soul knows its Source. It doesn't need to discover God. It departed from Source to look at God from the outside so it could express its gratitude and appreciation of God. But in the corporeal shell (the human body) the mind takes over and silences, if not dismisses, the Source totally. The human mind sees itself as a separate identity. Much akin to Lucifer and the God parable. In the 3D Star Program, the Soul volunteered to descend into total obscurity and disconnection. A very bold, courageous yet, pompous decision - quite over confident of its ultimate control over the whimsical (to cut it mildly) and illusioned mind. Now. You entered the arena of total Lack and continual Loss. As a learning institutional playground or school. Confident that, when thrown in a dark abyss, you would instinctively and intuitively Tap into the reservoir of non-dual energies of Godly attributes. Being organically a Soul (an Emergence from God/of God) you would not fear the dark but resort to automatically (coz its generic in composition) switch on the light. Today if you enter a dark room, in an unknown territory, you will reflexively look for a light switch to disperse the darkness. Won't you? So thought the Soul! It was that soul-assured, and definitive, that darkness (the Lack and Loss) would not impose any threat to its counterpart. So, coming from that place of secured and convinced assurity, the Soul offered its participation in the Abyss of Total Darkness. The Soul understood, that God is not what its counterpart would need to re-identify itself with, nor invest in knowing It. It further understood that the environment of evolution would be one of Lack Loss Suffering etc just so its body and mind would need to Tap into the Godly Attributes of non-dual qualities in order to maneuverer a safe 'Float above the darkness'. The human would need to Tap into ""Peace"" wherever and whenever it confronted Conflict and immediately Shanti would supersede. The human would need to Tap into ""Joy"" when in a condition of Lack so the darkness doesn't incapacitate the human's life. The human being would need to Tap into ""Detachment"" when faced with Loss so the pain doesn't overwhelm and cripple the human. This is all a human needs to learn from a 3D world of intense and extreme duality. If one remains in the generic Consciousness of Peace, all wars and fightings would evaporate as fast as they emerge. If one stays connected to God's Vibration of Joy, no lack of money can create fear and anxiety. The human would Know, he and she is taken care of by God. Moreover. If the human remained in the Feeling world of the Light, he would not spiral down into emotions of pain and suffering. Detachment would be the natural order of his nature! This is why we came to earth planet! To HOLD-ON to our organic God Attributes in total Darkness bereft of all Light. This is our only Test. BE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GOD AT ALL TIMES IRRESPECTIVE This is the Divine Message from the Light to us all on the 10:10 Portal Opening. Because number 10 is a ""GOOD KARMA"" number. Not a 'Karmic Debt' number as the other compounded numbers are. So, sit on the 10th at 10:00 Am & PM (at your time zone with no conversion of time required) and receive your Good Karma. And. Henceforth, keep the Cosmic Advise or Cosmic Wisdom at the forefront when faced with an upsurge of darkness. **Remain rooted in the God Consciousness qualities to remain afloat.** Its organic to your nature. You dont need to make any effort to discover it, unravel it, or comprehend nor master it. Its natural. Just be as soul-assured and pompous as your Soul is :-) Be confident that you are God. Where there is only abundance, prosperity, richness, undying wealth, perfect health, only joy, love, light and enlightenment. Why do you think whenever a human has had a Near-Death-Experience, he never wanted to return to earth. He found himself in the completeness of complete Joy and Love with such overwhelming lightness and perfection in beauty that he understood the Hell, that earth is - as an abnormal venue for evolution. Each human, once having accidentally walked into Heaven, was adamant in not-returning to Hell. How could he? Why would she? But had to return as his Learning was not yet complete, his karma not yet resolved. But, look at the benevolence of the Father, once that human was forcibly pushed back to Hell, his life changed and became better --- not coz, the circumstances improved but coz *he had changed, *once having felt the Love that Hell lacked! God had been experienced, appreciated, and gratitude felt, unlike when in the spirit! He now understood the value of Hell and became eager to learn all Hell had to offer (truncated)",,580,"{'like_count': 274, 'comment_count': 32, 'num_users': 46480}",THE SUN MASTERS,,2023-10-09 19:24:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/377506566_10160896096031866_7320793411721818420_n.jpg?stp=c0.6.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=e5IKls_n2DgAX9l9DHD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBu29eKZg9yzUTzi_3Q2kkmvvSzYh96_uXjHXardIRi4A&oe=655A9BA0,https://www.facebook.com/groups/136842465117173/permalink/604093248392090,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387839778_10160949135441866_8959157760947066594_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=XoGuUGsH8VsAX8BSJXG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC1tx1laxKHgPTyW8QqJqIAJJp-4hLP8hAwLSt5ykK3PQ&oe=65289BFE

facebook,"The Bible, rightly divided, does not say God hates divorce, and the Bible does not say that adultery is the only cause for divorce. The biblical marriage covenant has a zero tolerance of abuse ‚Äî of any kind. Abusers and lovers of violence are who God actually said He hates with a passion. So why do we have so many who are suffering in abusive marriages believing that ‚ÄúGod hates divorce‚Äù and ‚Äúabuse is not grounds for divorce?‚Äù Why are biblical lies this big believed by so many despite the liars, the tellers of these lies, knowing the biblical truth? Listen beloved, every biblical lie has a beneficiary, and these biblical lies are no exception. It doesn‚Äôt take much to figure out who benefits from these atrocious, biblical lies and who suffers. The toxic patriarchal misfit, who is the biblical equivalent of a Pharisee, is the beneficiary, and those they believe in their corrupt mind to be their property are the sufferers‚Ä¶women. It‚Äôs been that way since the beginning of time and the Bible records and rebukes it (Matthew 23), yet we are still contending with these heresies, and abuse victims are still being kept in bondage by these grotesque, self-serving, toxic patriarchal lies. I don‚Äôt know who this is for but I‚Äôm praying whoever needs it is set free from the bondage of spiritual abuse that keeps you prisoner in an abusive marriage: The Bible does not say ‚ÄúGod hates divorce.‚Äù That lie, like all biblical lies, is a whole lie created from a half truth. Malachi 2:16, the actual text that is misquoted to spiritually abuse and coerce abuse victims, not only does not say God hates divorce, it‚Äôs an egregious deception intended to distract from the context and whole truth of the scripture. The context of Malachi 2:16 is a rebuke of unfaithful, treacherous ‚Äúreligious‚Äù husbands who were throwing God‚Äôs daughters away to chase after whores (Malachi 2:10-15). God rebuked these religious perverts for their unholy behavior in Malachi 2:16: ‚ÄúThe man who hates and divorces his wife,‚Äù says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‚Äúdoes violence to the one he should protect,‚Äù says the Lord Almighty.‚Äù Now, imagine the scripture used to rebuke depraved and unfaithful religious husbands being twisted to keep innocent abuse victims bound in abusive, unfaithful and abominable marriages. Toxic religious patriarchy will stop at no lie to justify its distorted belief that women are ordained to suffer for the benefit of their depraved and perverted proclivities. Does this mean God loves divorce? No, it means divorce is a consequence of sin, and God takes no pleasure in the cause of divorce ‚Äî sin (Psalm 5:4). But let‚Äôs be clear, no spouse gets married to get divorced and no divorce from an abuser is a sin‚Ä¶abuse is the sin, divorce from an abuser is the consequence of an abuser‚Äôs covenant breaking sin: ‚ÄúDo not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction‚Ä¶‚Äù (Galatians 6:7-8). What does God say He hates? The Bible tells us: ‚ÄúThere are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community‚Äù (Proverbs 6:16-19). God repeats His utter and complete hatred of the behavior that causes divorce from an abuser: ‚ÄúThe Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion‚Äù (Psalm 11:5). That includes intimate partner abusers. The same toxic religious patriarchy who uses ‚ÄúGod hates divorce‚Äù to coerce abuse victims, is also responsible for the lie that adultery is the only biblical grounds for divorce ‚Äî but conveniently dismiss porn and marital rape as unfaithful. The same religious Pharisees that were throwing God‚Äôs daughters away, attempted to get Jesus to co-sign their depraved treatment of women by testing Him: ‚ÄúSome Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, ‚ÄúIs it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?‚Äù (Matthew 19:3). Now, to these depraved and whore chasing religious perverts, Jesus responded: ‚ÄúI tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery‚Äù (Matthew 19:9). Jesus was specifically addressing the behavior pervasive among these religious hypocrites which was throwing God‚Äôs daughters away for any reason including chasing whores. God was telling them that a man married to God‚Äôs daughter has no right to divorce her except for adultery, and if a man throws his wife away for their perverted reasons, that man would commit adultery if he married another woman. Why? Because not only were these perverts throwing wives away to chase whores, they refused to give the wife a letter of divorce. This meant that these injured spouses couldn‚Äôt remarry and they were relegated to a life of destitution ‚Äî while the (truncated)",,559,"{'like_count': 161, 'comment_count': 64, 'num_users': 149095}",Patrick Weaver Ministries,,2023-10-09 07:00:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/158019332_275007433995250_8558686633557984914_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=d6M_N4wNjzEAX83Yby8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmRK12SI05sEZbVHvHoRmYw4lBqTe1rzDuRvQoAIRTeA&oe=657D10EC,https://www.facebook.com/100044579857544/posts/870957964400191,

facebook,"Appeal to Armenian diaspora organizations from the International Foundation of World Azerbaijanis (IFWA): After more than thirty years of conflict, the military confrontation between Azerbaijan and Armenia has come to an end. The leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia are currently continuing their efforts to achieve a peace agreement between the two countries. Both leaders have repeatedly declared that a peace agreement can only be signed under condition of mutual recognition of territorial integrity and sovereignty. As a consequence, some major and important tasks stand before intellectuals, public organizations and diaspora organizations of the two countries; these include supporting the leaders‚Äô peace efforts, building bridges of trust and confidence between the two neighbouring countries and paving the way of their peaceful coexistence. Following the local anti-terrorist measures conducted by Azerbaijan which aimed to restore constitutional structure within its borders, peaceful Armenian residents, voluntarily or under the influence of other forces, left their homes and moved to Armenia and third countries. The President of Azerbaijan, Mr. Ilham Aliyev has repeatedly stated that the ethnic Armenians living in the Karabakh region are citizens of Azerbaijan and their rights and security will be ensured according to the Constitution of Azerbaijan. In the face of this reality, there is a serious need for joint efforts of progressive forces in both countries to advance cause of peace and overcome hostility between the two nations. It is no secret that, as in past years, there are international powers who still resist stability in the region and normalization of relations between the two neighbouring nations. Some groups, being used by international powers as pawns, are also striving to prevent the establishment of normal relations between the Azerbaijani and Armenian people. The IFWA, which includes numerous Azerbaijani diaspora organizations, believes that the organizations of both diasporas should refrain from any actions that incite enmity between the two nations. Such actions are nothing but obstacles to processes towards peace and peaceful coexistence that are being developed in the region. Diaspora organizations operating abroad should not incite discord or enmity in the region, but should promote peace and peaceful coexistence. Rushing to the streets located hundreds of kilometres away from the South Caucasus region, inciting confrontation and organizing raids on diplomatic missions does not contribute to region‚Äôs prosperity in any way. Karabakh, a cradle of culture, has always been rich in its ethnic diversity. To rebuild its stable ethnic structure and to achieve lasting peace in the region, both Armenian and Azerbaijani diaspora organizations should spare no effort in supporting normalization of relations and reintegration. The people of two states that have a common border spreading over hundreds of kilometres, have no choice but to live in peace, recognize and respect each other's territorial integrity. The large-scale development and construction works currently ongoing in Karabakh aim to improve social welfare of all people living in the region, regardless of their ethnicity. The state of Azerbaijan carries out acontinuous work to ensure sustainable reintegration of Armenian citizens residing in the Karabakh region into our society. The working group created for this purpose has been assigned relevant tasks aimed to resolve social, humanitarian, economic and infrastructure issues in the Karabakh region. This work includes registration of Armenian residents living in the Karabakh region, understanding their needs and proposing measures for solving problems they may face. IFWA hopes that responsible organizations of Armenian diaspora will renounce regressive efforts and actions against Azerbaijan and support reintegration of Armenians living in Karabakh into Azerbaijani society. IFWA believes that cooperation between the two diaspora organizations is vital for promotion of peace and reintegration, and expresses readiness to support joint efforts in this direction.

facebook,"*THE PALESTINE-ISRAEL CONFLICT* 1. The reactions to the latest hostility between Palestinians and the Israelis actually underscores why the conflict, which has been more than seven decades, would not find a solution. 2. Firstly, the responses that came from powerful Western nations and their apparatus, including their media, are hypocritical, bigoted and pathological. 3. Instead of addressing the conflict for what it actually is, they chose to continue with their deceptive narrative that it is an attack on Israel by terrorists ‚Äì their blame being obviously against Hamas, the Hezbollah and Iran. 4. With that narrative, they stoke fear in the Western community, claiming that it is an attack on democracy and peace loving people. 5. With that, the US in particular feel justified to extend military support to Israel to ‚Äúretaliate‚Äù against Palestinians attacks. 6. All these are far from the truth. Instead they are outright lies which had been perpetuated unashamedly by Western leaders and their media. 7. The truth is actually very simple. 8. For decades, the Israelis had been committing war crimes, massacres, genocide and unthinkable atrocities against the Palestinians. 9. These are not one-off acts but rather systematically conducted without respite throughout the seven decades. 10. Apart from Palestinian land which the Israelis acquired illegally through unilateral agreements and treaties with former occupiers of Palestine, the Israeli settlers have been forcefully seizing lands and farms belonging to Palestinians. 11. The Palestinians are chased out of their land and any attempt to seek some form of restitution from the Israeli authorities are met with violence backed most times by the Israeli security forces namely the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). 12. The Palestinians, pushed to the corner, while Gaza was turned into an open air prison, attempted sporadic retaliations, which in turn were met with the full force of the IDF with weapons supplied by superpowers in particular the US. 13. This episode is not any different from previous retaliations except that probably this time around they are more focussed with a bit more assistance externally. 14. But the Western powers and their apparatus continue with their lies, with their narratives that the hostility is an act of terror committed by terrorists, ignoring the fact that it is retaliation by a people whose freedom and rights to their land had been forcefully taken away from them. 15. They refuse to view the hostility is committed by freedom fighters who are up against an injustice committed by an apartheid regime which had been perpetrating genocide on the Palestinians. 16. The Western powers and the US are party to apartheid, genocide and crimes against humanity for as long as they support the heinous Israeli regime. 17. With that, any attempt towards finding a just and fair solution for the Palestinians becomes an exercise in futility. 18. In the meantime, the Israelis can be expected to carry out their genocide with impunity and with total disregard of international laws. *DR MAHATHIR BIN MOHAMAD* Oct 9, 2023 https://x.com/chedetofficial/status/1711309964424458466?s=20:=:https://twitter.com/chedetofficial/status/1711309964424458466?s=20",,505,"{'like_count': 385, 'comment_count': 46, 'num_users': 1466719}",Kelab Che Det,,2023-10-09 11:41:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/243456906_383833189871354_3852453255929554183_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=oMEQwHTk-9kAX-Y88Cu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCCGiS1iQ7H96CjIdUjmtWzSADeZ_8hTrwp1qaJU5zaAg&oe=6559F681,https://www.facebook.com/100047340275913/posts/855645706023431,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387041630_855645599356775_5375518397011766106_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=34bsTXtQhLAAX_kEFyk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBJc9IpiOOMc5gYrQubDKykSvdFRybMCP3HNbu7baIEzA&oe=653FBCC2

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel? Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

facebook,"I have a very close relationship with ◊î◊õ◊ï◊®◊°◊ê ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊î ◊ú◊ê◊ï◊®, my publishing house in Israel, including a wonderful friendship with publisher Hilit Hamou-Meir. Not so long ago, she sent me a beautiful basket of handmade wares (and chocolates!) from Galilee, which I treasure; it sits just beside my desk. And when I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, she immediately helped me to connect with Israeli breast cancer organization One in Nine so that I could reach Israeli readers with my story and encourage them to stay up to date with their mammograms. I have a tremendous respect for her, and for the many readers there in Israel who have reached out to me over the years. Just as many of us have, I've felt very helpless these last two days watching the terrible events in Israel unfold from afar. I asked Hilit over the weekend if she could suggest an organization that concerned Americans might be able to donate to, to help provide humanitarian aid to Israelis impacted by the terrorist attacks, and she suggested this campaign: https://www.americaisraeldemocracy.org/southunderattack It looks like the organization, a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit, was founded to ""educate, strengthen, and preserve the democratic foundations of the State of Israel,"" but this particular campaign promises to ""support medical, psycho-social, physical assistance and aid for families with members kidnapped to Gaza."" I don't know enough about the organization to personally endorse it, but I did a bit of research and made a donation there myself this morning. Another organization doing good work in the region: Save the Children, which has been working with children impacted by the ongoing conflict since 1953, with a permanent presence in Gaza since 1973. They help both Palestinian and Israeli children--I think we can all agree that no child, on either side of the border, should have to live through what's happening right now: https://www.savethechildren.org/us/where-we-work/west-bank-gaza#statement:=:https://www.savethechildren.org/us/where-we-work/west-bank-gaza I made a donation to Save the Children, too. Harper's Bazaar also provides a good list of aid organizations responding to the violence if you're interested in making a donation for humanitarian aid: https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a45477422/how-to-help-victims-war-israel-palestine-donate/ (Pictured: THE FOREST OF VANISHING STARS in Hebrew)",,479,"{'like_count': 157, 'comment_count': 72, 'num_users': 61535}",Kristin Harmel,,2023-10-09 11:28:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/102379060_106715547744615_2797701536362464765_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=W_4UpHOP6iIAX-ZjSN_&_nc_oc=AQlAMDy0MKSMBevOZjCCLgl8wv3Jt2kH1w3c9CJgVGIMv0m5qXQ65F7J_oTSMBycakE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBue4HYuYKdouz-s1W7G5mCgVt2maHD9CBmqJ9vUwMkeQ&oe=657D2578,https://www.facebook.com/100052185093446/posts/873071957775633,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387822451_873064351109727_4767122828637645865_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=t7MKM6incqYAX8unPEw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmFsVyt-HJdgXZgbG1Q4hcK_wIC03VsskaItZbEBOLJg&oe=65595A8A

The team included officers of the Traffic Section under the undergoing initiative of Inspector (Ag.), Allister Kistow, of the Sangre Grande Police Station, which is geared towards sensitising and conditioning the impressionable in the Sangre Grande District to curb the ‚Äúhigh levels of indiscipline displayed by young adults in society today.‚Äù Over 500 students and 29 teaching staff were present who were ‚Äúvery appreciative and interactive‚Äù with the lawmen who described the session as ‚Äúwell-received.‚Äù",,460,"{'like_count': 263, 'comment_count': 74, 'num_users': 270558}",Trinidad and Tobago Police Service,,2023-10-09 13:09:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/346982757_180584188278034_7796463031066191033_n.png?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=W50x1Zrl30sAX97cnAJ&_nc_oc=AQnpVt4o5Xxf8dR3djYd-Av7QEIH2fz53CLohTcY1rDeXgPCak7bfEqfXoy_iEdh9Yg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB_NWFu_C_D7kF5BgPy2YEXRRlyaTvV-MzTq-EnGxkjdA&oe=655A9E31,https://www.facebook.com/100064681267313/posts/726639119502124,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387742086_726639619502074_7032109472124544188_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=ZjtyUBeajOoAX_9F252&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAW43zg1-ZFyJCi8wEcQvioQiNONfqatqSOwcsA5iIWsA&oe=65288D97
facebook,"KABATAAN PARTYLIST ON THE ISRAEL-PALESTINE CONFLICT Tumitindig ang Kabataan Partylist para sa tunay na kalayaan at kapayapaan sa mga lupaing okupado ng Israel. Ninanais natin ang kaligtasan ng mga mamamayang apektado ng umiigting na labanan sa pagitan ng mga Palestino at ng pamahalaan ng Israel. Batay sa datos ng United Nations (UN), hindi kamakailan lamang nagsimula ang labanan. Sa huling labinlimang (15) taon, nasa 6,400 mamamayang Palestino ang namatay at mahigit 120,000 ng sugatan, habang nasa 300 naman ang nasawi at mahigit 6,000 ang sugatan sa panig ng Israel. Bunga ito ng pitumpu't limang (75) taong okupasyon ng gobyerno ng Israel sa mga teritoryo ng Palestine, kabilang ang Gaza at West Bank, na nagpalayas sa daan-daang libong Palestino mula sa kanilang mga komunidad at nilalagay ang mamamayang Israeli sa mabuway na kalagayan ng pamumuhay. Labag sa pandaigdigang batas at maituturing na krimen sa digmaan o 'war crime' ang deka-dekadang okupasyon, at maging ang mga kinatawan ng UN ay naglabas ng mga pahayag laban dito. Gayumpaman, nagiging posible pa rin ang okupasyon dahil sa pagsuporta ng gobyerno ng Estados Unidos sa gobyerno ng Israel, na siyang pinakamalaking tumatanggap ng dayuhang tulong pinansyal mula sa Estados Unidos. Taliwas sa tindig ng UN, sinusuportahan ng Estados Unidos ang okupasyon at hinaharangan o pinalalabnaw ang mga resolusyon ng UN na kumukondena sa mga abuso at paglabag sa karapatan ng mga mamamayang naninirahan sa mga okupadong lugar. Makakamit lamang ang tunay na kapayapaan at kalayaan para sa mga Palestino at Israeli kapag napawi na ang ugat ng labanan. Kailangang tapusin na ang okupasyon ng Gaza at West Bank, at dapat itigil ng ibang mga bansa ang pagsuporta sa mga pwersang nagtutulak ng okupasyon. Sa kagyat, dapat maprotektahan ang buhay ng lahat ng mga sibilyan habang nangyayari ang labanan. Krimen sa digmaan ang pagtarget sa mga paaralan, moske at bahay ng mga sibilyan sa Gaza; krimen din ang planong blockade sa Gaza na maghaharang sa akses ng mahigit 2 milyong sibilyan sa kuryente, pagkain, tubig at iba pang batayang pangangailangan. Suportado ng Kabataan Partylist ang mga hakbang para mabilis na protektahan ang mga migranteng Pilipino na nasa mga apektadong lugar at ilikas ang ating mga OFW papunta sa mas ligtas na matutuluyan. Dapat mapakawalan sa lalong madaling panahon ang sinumang Pilipinong magiging bihag ng mga armadong pwersang bahagi ng labanan. ### PRESS STATEMENT October 9, 2023",,460,"{'like_count': 133, 'comment_count': 48, 'num_users': 258288}",KABATAAN PARTYLIST,,2023-10-09 14:00:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/383342437_866958681488409_8474734267950364330_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=P2UHhI2lxrEAX-f7rT0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAb5-KsNRmkD4HyyAVqdAlgLEhG93T_b2RKnI_C0eWK1g&oe=655A9E9F,https://www.facebook.com/100045228561623/posts/873906980793579,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387758361_873906914126919_782988182094862503_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=47ZrANnJWlMAX_Qu1hZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCCLz69W4XryGUH7TMJs_C_JHaXh5iId5hC8G20xdLJQA&oe=654FB780

facebook,"Why is there a lack of global coverage regarding the death toll in other countries? On September 21st, I predicted that after the autumn equinox on September 23rd, there would be an increase in casualties. Unfortunately, my prediction proved to be true. On October 7th, a devastating earthquake struck Herat Province in Afghanistan resulting in the tragic loss of over seven thousand lives. Additionally, the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israelis has led to the senseless killings of over two thousand innocent civilians. Moreover, a heartbreaking bus crash occurred in southern Mexico on Friday, claiming the lives of over eighteen Venezuelan and Haitian immigrants. On September 25th, I predicted the commencement of a war, and unfortunately, my prediction has come to fruition. This war is spreading like an uncontrollable plague to other nations, which would result in a rapidly escalating death toll worldwide. In November of this year, expect another significant group of individuals to tragically lose their lives through terrible circumstances. As major seismic activities intensifies, along with other major disasters occurring more frequently, many more citizens worldwide will leave their mortal shell and depart this world. The war in the Middle East will continue to escalate, and other Islamic nations will begin to join forces to unite in a collective effort to overcome their shared enemy. In this case, the enemy will not only be Israel, but will be America and Britain. Therefore, expect aggressive attacks to be amplified against these two countries.

facebook,"#mondaymotivation Love in the midst of life There‚Äôs only places the right two can go. With the wrong hand in yours There really is no telling where you will be led. Wrong words, wrong places, wrong feelings, wrong stories, fake smiles , wrong just wrong. The right person will make you care if the stars are out , or if the breeze is just enough to send you the scent of their hair. They know your heart, and your flaws, and it somehow creates the right combination to fit the complex puzzle of theirs. Forgiveness and compromise comes natural. You know their love wouldn‚Äôt allow for intentional pain or conflict. They would gladly bleed for you, in any situation that may apply. When sudden stops happen on trips, your right hand instinctively goes out in an attempt to be the external force that could overcome and protect them from inertia. Thought of self safety and health at times fall by the wayside. Because without them and their well-being you would feel like the lone dove. No longer wanting wind giving lift to your wings in what seems to be every pointless flight. It‚Äôs so easy to let time slip by without putting gratitude towards the importance of what could leave you any second without warning. Love in life is no different from a house fire, or a tragic accident. Except the pain never gets better. It‚Äôs loss not replaced with the right policy. It finds a place to reside and lingers like the ghosts of war. You forget there are stars. The moon is just another reminder that it too is alone. Be grateful. Be kind, be with who you can‚Äôt be without, and show them. You don‚Äôt want to know how long the miles of eternity look to the lonely or the misplaced. No breeze bringing their scent, and their laughter at some point will no longer be a sound your memory can mimic. Show who you love you love them with more than who you are, but what you are. And if you‚Äôre holding the wrong hand, let go. Be where you need to be. Life is shorter than it was yesterday. I love you all- TG",,409,"{'like_count': 155, 'comment_count': 120, 'num_users': 30175}",Thomas Gabriel,,2023-10-09 19:55:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/152256442_257974639276987_1207787162409826068_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=wn9Iu4QMitUAX_JbKor&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB5Sx0qUa7_xBIgh-TcJQeKZylGg68jYXCOqisttNlTMA&oe=657D2545,https://www.facebook.com/100051933581659/posts/869504631457315,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387132963_869506864790425_7121918864088570374_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=1wFisodfZ4EAX975e2-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCMdHQ3fCqBcJkkb3rqIfIGpNwlDCCkdMaDIZCWd1MAqg&oe=654C8B4B

facebook,"Daily 9 October 2023 So I see you may having been having some doubts, fears or negative thoughts around a situation in your life. Your higher self (your soul) and spirit team are guiding you in your intuition to remain positive about the situation at hand. It may have a better result or outcome than you had imagined. As long as it‚Äôs for the highest good of all you will be supported. Our thoughts and our minds light the way of our reality so when we change it to that of a light nature it makes a big difference. I see an improvement in mental and physical health that could be due to efforts around lifestyle changes. If there is discord or conflict it shows a peaceful resolution is soon on its way in the near future. Let go of control and believe in your capabilities to create abundance opportunity for yourself through your chosen career or talents.

The opposition leader pointed out that development will not take place properly until it is created and it will not be possible to provide permanent solutions to the problems arising based on land requirements. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said so by addressing the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Wildlife, Environment and Natural Resources. Hon. Sajith Premadasa underlined that in order for environmental and wildlife conservation projects to be successful, they must be community-centered, with the community being a pioneer in the process of safeguarding the environment and wildlife.

facebook,"The US will likely 'go to war' in Israel with air and naval power if Syria or Iran become actively involved, retired 4-star general says Amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, Ret. Gen. Barry McCaffrey expressed concerns that the U.S. may be forced into military intervention in Israel if neighboring nations become more involved in the ongoing conflict. McCaffrey, during his appearance on MSNBC's ""Weekends with Alex Witt,"" emphasized that the U.S. would consider direct intervention with air and naval strikes, especially if Israel's existence is at stake due to escalating actions from countries like Syria and Iran. Commenting on the potential involvement of regional powers, he said, ""The other shoe we're waiting to see if it drops is, will Hezbollah intervene out of Lebanon with their 100,000 some odd rockets? Will the West Bank ignite? And what will the Syrians and the Egyptians do?"" This came after Hamas militants launched a series of attacks against Israel, resulting in significant casualties on both sides. Israel, in retaliation, has declared war. The U.S., in response to the situation, announced the deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group to patrol the Eastern Mediterranean, aiming to deter a full-blown war involving Israel and its neighboring countries. McCaffrey, drawing from his experience from the Gulf War and his tenure leading the U.S. Southern Command, believes the U.S. show of force isn't purely symbolic. He stated, ""They're there for more than a show of force or a potential noncombatant evacuation."" However, he also clarified that while air and naval power might be deployed, it's improbable that U.S. ground troops would enter Israel, given the nation's own potent ground forces. When questioned about possible involvement from other allies, McCaffrey felt it was premature to speculate but highlighted the Biden administration's goal of deterrence. ""They want to make sure that the Syrian military and Hezbollah don't enter this fray,"" he noted. Hezbollah, meanwhile, announced its shelling of the Golan Heights, an area annexed by Israel from Syria in 1981, expressing solidarity with ""Palestinian resistance."" Reports from The Wall Street Journal indicate a collaboration between Iranian officials and Hamas in preparation for the recent incursions into Israel. While U.S. State Secretary Antony Blinken acknowledged the historical ties between Hamas and Iran, he stated that there's no direct evidence pointing to Iran's orchestration of the current attack. Egypt's Foreign Ministry has also sounded alarms about the situation's escalation and called for restraint from both Israel and the Palestinians. The U.S. State and Defense Departments have yet to make official comments on McCaffrey's statements or the evolving situation in the region.",,389,"{'like_count': 221, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 93289}",Belize Live News,,2023-10-09 10:58:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/323347673_719179332829420_5300813974315463983_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=aXewoOVb7DwAX-MR0Z6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD38upzzOQ96R9oDKJrC8KVyc2NUVRG3UjP0UXkc3JXiw&oe=655AEDEF,https://www.facebook.com/100064133798981/posts/733670782114042,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387053062_733670372114083_8543772764023779459_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=pHVraIrfmgQAX-wUN-y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA2ARvyb-2xmmla6h4nAyY1MIkJ0SDi4Zxd1bRw4TliGA&oe=65296AEF

This significant milestone fills our hearts with pride and gratitude, marking a journey of resilience, unity, and the unwavering spirit of our people. This year's Fiji Day theme, ""Rebuilding Fiji Together,"" reflects not only our aspirations but also the indomitable spirit that has guided us through the years. It underscores our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder, forging a brighter future for all Fijians. But today, I wish to expand upon this theme, intertwining it with a vision that transcends our national borders‚Äîthe ""Pacific Zone of Peace."" Recently, I had the privilege of representing our beloved Fiji at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. There, on the global stage, we introduced the concept of the ""Pacific Zone of Peace"" as our Blue Pacific's invaluable contribution to global order. This vision embodies the very essence of our commitment to peace, mutual respect, and unity in our region. The ""Pacific Zone of Peace"" is rooted in the fundamental values of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence. It calls for the nurturing and enhancement of international cooperation, inviting nations to collaborate on areas of common interest. In an ever-changing world, it reminds us of the power of unity and our shared responsibility to create a better future. We, in the Pacific, face unique challenges. The threats of climate change loom large, casting a shadow over our islands and communities. Rising sea levels, frequent cyclones, and the displacement of our people are daily reminders of the urgency to address this crisis. It is in these trying times that the ""Pacific Zone of Peace"" becomes not just an aspiration but a lifeline‚Äîa call for global solidarity in the face of environmental challenges that threaten our very existence. Today, as we celebrate our independence, we are reminded that peace is not only the absence of conflict but also the presence of cooperation and understanding among our people. In our multicultural society, peace serves as the cornerstone that nurtures unity and drives progress. It empowers us to harness the collective strength of our diverse backgrounds, cultures, and traditions. In our rapidly developing nation, peace is the catalyst for innovation, investment, and economic growth. It attracts partners and investors who recognize the stability and potential of a peaceful Fiji. It equips us to confront the challenges of climate change and global disruptions with resilience and determination. Our commitment to the ""Pacific Zone of Peace"" reinforces our dedication to fostering regional and global collaboration. It sends a resounding message that Fiji is a staunch advocate for peace, both at home and on the international stage. As we rejoice in the spirit of independence, let us rekindle our commitment to safeguarding and enhancing the peace that underpins our progress. Together, as one united people, we will continue to build a Fiji that thrives economically and stands as a shining example of unity in diversity. ùêáùêöùê©ùê©ùê≤ ùêÖùê¢ùê£ùê¢ ùêÉùêöùê≤ ùê≠ùê® ùêöùê•ùê•!

facebook,"It seems to me that most people don't really understand what the fuss in Israel is all about, particularly as Jews have their own, capable, strong country, and Palestinians are - as media often report - living in dire poverty behind guarded, concrete barriers. It's very easy to start thinking that those poor people deserve some sort of statehood of their own and that Jews are their oppressors. It's also easy to be deceived into believing that the entire conflict has been going on for so long and is so complicated that surely, at the very least, both sides are to blame. üî¥ The reality is far simpler and I've decided to sum it up in three points in the image attached. Only one side of this conflict has ever accepted to live side-by-side with the other, in two separate countries. Only one side agreed to share the holy city of Jerusalem, important to Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, under independent, international jurisdiction. The Jewish side. And while it seems that Israel is a powerful nation, it's only inhabited by 9 million people, 2 million of whom are Arabs with Israeli passports. That leaves 7 million Jews surrounded by 460+ million Arabs living in neighbouring countries in the Middle East and North Africa + 88 million Iranians. These proportions have always been skewed heavily against the Jews, so they never wanted to start any wars. They just wanted to finally have a small country of their own, in their historical homeland that they had migrated to since the 19th century, following hundreds of years of deprivation and the Holocaust in which 6 million had been methodically exterminated by the Nazis. That's all. To frame these people as some sort of bloodthirsty occupiers is an absurdity of monumental proportions. However, these weaknesses also explain why Arabs were never interested in any talks or compromise - they were just so convinced of their numerical superiority that they did not think it possible that any Jewish state could survive. Today we're often hearing about Jewish settlers dividing the West Bank into smaller and smaller pockets that Palestinians can live in but the fact of the matter is that Jews never wanted the West Bank, which was under Jordanian control until 1967. They captured the area during the Six Day War, after pleading with Jordanian king not to take part in the conflict but he refused. In the very same war they captured Sinai, which they later returned to Egypt in exchange for recognition and peace. For the longest time West Bank was considered just another bargaining chip and the settlement policy started as a security measure, given the persistent Arab threat. And yes, after decades of indiscriminate terrorism and failed promises by Palestinian leaders, it has become a de facto policy of squeezing Palestinians out. But it was not intended in the first place - Jews were more than content with the original 1947 plan and just wanted space for themselves, away from bombs, bullets and gas chambers. That's all. So, fast-forward several decades, what you're seeing today is not Israel oppressing poor Palestinians but rather a victim that has overpowered his oppressor, containing him to isolated, controlled areas, limiting the harm that he can inflict. And if you take pity on Palestinians today you have to remember that the conditions they live in are a consequence of seven decades of trying to get rid of Jews. And even now they voted Hamas into power in 2006 and the organisation's leader, Ismail Haniyeh, would still win their presidential election today (if they ever got round to calling one). Choices have consequences.",,382,"{'like_count': 229, 'comment_count': 92, 'num_users': 30072}",Critical Spectator,,2023-10-09 23:34:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352238793_654473106721732_8208518943407117173_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8x1dfcAuWJAAX-vhCco&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDoyth8BBPqVJqadFMrpRKihzW7HjUjoWULue8-_w1Hsw&oe=6559EC35,https://www.facebook.com/100044208020618/posts/881335393350053,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387767714_881321843351408_4533979329733254287_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NcIAgXZ_OyUAX_9kyro&_nc_oc=AQm8KqbaDombH63G_-HTCNb7oFqHaunwIsLXsn3qCVsrNwvJDQlLj5L5NnfMU8i7loQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAJcUJPcMRgQKxr3QeEnwaV2P2OebyIxH_0KWofHmZABA&oe=65328DC4

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel? Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers. And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7) The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus. The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets. It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says. Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God. This is no time to follow popular opinions. This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word. So what's our assignment as Christians? Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers. So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

Powerful women of Africa II
Mantsopa Makhetha

Prophetess Anna Mantsopa Makhetha was born in 1795 at a place called Likotsi or Ramakhetheng near present day Maseru. She is the daughter of Nkopane, elder brother of Makhetha, and Sesilane. The name she was given at birth is Koena-li-fule, which means ‚Äúthe crocodiles are feeding/ crocodile feed‚Äù.  When she was young she witnessed the horrors of famine caused by the Difaqane, which forced many people to turn to cannibalism and sadly this is how she lost her father.

She was also taken captive for 6 months by an Nguni group called Amankowane (or Mankoane), who swept down the country in pursuit of Pakalitha and his AmaHlubi. Fortunately, she managed to escape when some of her relatives came into the area trading animal skins for mealies. 

Mantsopa was supposed to marry her cousin Lekote (son of her father‚Äôs elder brother, Makhetha), but he died shortly after the dowry cattle were handed over. She, therefore, got married to his brother, Selatile, who already had five wives and bore four children (three daughters and one son namely; Ntsopa, Motsielehi, Ts‚Äôiu and Sesilane).

As is customary in the Basotho culture for a mother to change her name after the birth of her first child by adding the prefix ‚ÄúMa or Mma‚Äù to the name of the first child, she became MaNtsopa. It is believed that she inherited her healing, rainmaking, divining and prophesying powers from her uncle Mohlomi, who had trained a young and ambitious Moshoeshoe before becoming his political advisor.

During the early 1850s Mantsopa prophesied that the Basotho would win a battle against the British troops led by Major Warden. She became renowned as a prophetess, living legend and advisor to Moshoeshoe I when her prophesies about successive wars were fulfilled. Eugene Casalis (French missionary) recalled how, in anticipation of conflict with Major Warden's forces in 1851, Moshoeshoe was only concerned about whether to await the enemy or to commence the attack thanks to Mantsopa.

Over time she prophesised many victories including that over Batlokwa of Sekonyela in 1853 and predicted many events such as the rinderpest epidemic that followed World War I.  However, her role as an advisor to Moshoeshoe ended in 1868 when the British annexed Basutoland (Lesotho). That same year, she was baptised by a French missionary called Theophile Jousse and given the name Anna.

Soon after, she moved to Modderpoort (outside Ladybrand in the Free State) and joined Anglican missionaries. Although she had been baptised as a Christian, Mantsopa continued working with herbs and divining. This did not sit well with the missionaries as they regarded what she did as black magic, but she still continued.

Her conversion to Christianity was in itself surprising, because her early encounters with the missionaries were ambivalent. They disagreed on a lot of things such as how she did not believe that she needed the bible to reach God as she already had direct contact with him through her visions.  She also disputed the missionary contention that the road to reach God was narrow, saying that the path in her view was wide to accommodate many people. Nonetheless, she agreed that there was one God, but remained critical of what she perceived as an anti-Basotho notion in their teachings. 

She died at the age of 111 and was buried with Christian rites in the Modderpoort cemetery, alongside the Brothers of the Society of St Augustine and the white residents of Modderpoort. Her grave, the cave where she prayed and the freshwater spring (reputedly pointed out to Mantsopa as a source of ‚Äòsacred‚Äô water by her ancestor) are major tourist attractions visited mostly by pilgrims who go there for various reasons (e.g. for prayers, to collect water from the sacred spring or to pay respects to the memory of their prophetess).  The Free State Provincial Heritage Resources Authority declared the grave and cave as provincial heritage sites.",,376,"{'like_count': 146, 'comment_count': 37, 'num_users': 254623}",Dithoko tsa Basotho,,2023-10-09 21:23:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/83589218_10220683348774590_4119155232099794944_n.jpg?stp=c13.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=1c-hJBYe9B8AX9Y3WeR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCcP5INCFPFS--pR_HwKomXx-OFnzLLcorc_VSIPoolUw&oe=657D233D,https://www.facebook.com/groups/103027076554900/permalink/2198383943685859,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/68530646_1727505454061059_3775115900580003840_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7f8c78&_nc_ohc=T8uOaWUKp7EAX-z6lwu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAUSUFJ4LKWbht9fM1-LvIGobcitZa7vxoqQxUM-gLB5Q&oe=657ACB64

‚Å£
As someone who guides families through murder and loss, often caused by police or a government that refuses to provide justice, I understand murder and loss better than I wish I did. Me and @leemerrittesq can hardly sleep as a result of the work we‚Äôve done all our lives.‚Å£

What about 2009?‚Å£
‚Å£
‚û°Ô∏è LOOK AT THE GRAPHIC. ‚Å£
‚Å£
In both of those years, far more Palestinians were killed by Israel than Israelis have been killed this week. ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚û°Ô∏èIf 2023 is 9/11 for Israel, WHAT DO WE CALL 2014, when Israel killed a STAGGERING 2,142 Palestinians? That‚Äôs comparable to 9/11. ‚Å£
‚Å£
üö®To say that Palestinians ‚Äústarted a war‚Äù would be to pretend that Israel and Palestine didn‚Äôt even exist before this weekend!!! And it would be pretending like none of these other years in this graph ever happened.‚Å£
‚Å£
But they did happen. You and I were alive for it. ‚Å£
‚Å£
1. This chart is from the @NYTimes. And the data is rock solid and widely accepted. ‚Å£
‚Å£
2. If you squint REALLY hard in most years you will see a little bit of purple there. That‚Äôs the amount of casualties Israel has suffered. ‚Å£

instagram,"Hamas launched a large-scale attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip on Saturday, October 7, a day after the 50th anniversary of the start of the Yom Kippur War, also known as the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.‚Å†
‚Å†
On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israeli positions in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights. Magnum photographers @michabaram.archive, @leonardfreed, @abbas.photos and Bruno Barbey closely documented the ensuing 19-day armed conflict between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hamas began this weekend‚Äôs attack with a barrage of rockets while militants crossed the border into Israel, killing and taking civilians and soldiers hostage. Israel has since formally declared war, responding with heavy airstrikes and cutting off electricity in Gaza. Both sides have suffered hundreds of casualties.‚Å†

instagram,"ISRAEL HAMAS WAR

Israel currently provides food, fuel and electricity to palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli government says it will cut off these provisions, to Palestinians who are already suffering and displaced. They will turn to other neighbors, including Egypt, to fill the vacuum. 

Israel is seeking ways to retaliate that won‚Äôt threaten the lives of the hostages in Gaza, so perhaps this is one motive for this choice. It is also true that some members of the Israeli government have said terrible dehumanizing things about the Palestinian civilian population; the government is made up of many far-right extremists unpopular with the majority of the Israeli public. There have been mass protests in the streets for months because so many Israelis object to the extremists and their policies. 

Hamas is an Iran-backed terrorist organization that drove out the governing leadership of the Palestinian Authority in 2007 and has controlled Gaza ever since. Hamas has conducted suicide attacks against civilians and kidnappings. Hamas does not recognize Israel‚Äôs right to exist and supports the extermination of Jews and the creation of fundamentalist state throughout the region. There are other Palestinian leaders who have worked for peace and co-existence. Hamas is not that. 

If you want to offer more context or a different way to frame these developments please do so with compassion and curiosity. Righteousness, intolerance, cruelty are not welcome here.

Israel has declared a ‚Äúcomplete siege‚Äù of Gaza, cutting off water, food and power supplies, as Hamas militants threatened to start killing Israeli civilian hostages if the bombing of civilian areas in the enclave continued without prior warning.

Palestinian militants abducted more than 100 people during a surprise multi-front attack in which they killed more than 700 ‚Äì making Saturday the deadliest day in Israel‚Äôs history. Israeli media said on Monday the death toll had climbed to 900, with 2,616 injured.

In response, Israel has pounded the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, killing hundreds of people in retaliation. The death toll in Gaza has risen to 560, with 2,900 injured, according to Palestinian authorities.

With rockets flying overhead, Ward and her team demonstrated incredible bravery as they swiftly dove into a nearby ditch to avoid the incoming artillery. This harrowing experience highlights the dedication and commitment of journalists who risk their lives to bring us real-time updates from conflict zones.

instagram,"Israeli lawmaker Ofer Cassif has condemned the Hamas attack on Israel that occurred on Saturday while also accusing the Israeli government of being fascist and leading pogroms against Palestinians, resulting in ethnic cleansing.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Cassif, a member of the leftist Hadash coalition, also criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not caring about the well-being of Israeli and Palestinian citizens, but only being motivated by self-preservation.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The ongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian lands by the Israeli government is believed to be the root cause of the attack, according to Cassif.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The situation raises the prospect of a broader regional conflict, with Hezbollah launching guided rockets and artillery in solidarity with the Palestinian people, and an Egyptian policeman opening fire on Israeli tourists in Alexandria, killing two.‚Å†

instagram,"Watching in horror the brutal massacre, kidnappings, murder and torturing of innocent civilians in Israel by Hamas, a terrorist organisation determined to kill Jews and abolish the state of Israel. I‚Äôve been amazed by how little empathy or even acknowledgment people have shown to what‚Äôs been going on. Somehow condemning terror that‚Äôs directed at children, women and old ladies is ok if the victims are Israeli, or is it Jews? I forget. And yea, you can totally be critical of Israel‚Äôs government (past and current), their policies and actions over the years, and support the Palestinian people‚Äôs right to freedom and land (I do too) without being antisemitic, but if you say nothing against this horror and somehow find ways to justify it, then chances are that you ARE antisemitic whether you realise it or not. Jews around the world are being targeted as we speak. People who have no contact with Israel, some have never even visited and are unable to impact its politics, today walk in fear. Why is that?! The inability to separate between Jews and the Israeli government IS antisemitism and is as damaging as the inability to separate between the Palestinian people and Hamas. It‚Äôs a result of ignorance and I urge anyone who feels ‚Äúconfused‚Äù (I‚Äôve heard that word several times over the past few days) to educate themselves. I‚Äôve written an article about the Middle East conflict for those who want to learn more and I‚Äôve linked in my bio, but beyond the analytical understanding of the situation, I urge you to not forget your humanity. Hamas has kidnapped toddlers. TODDLERS. Are they to blame for Israel government‚Äôs injustices? Are we saying that it‚Äôs ok to rape and kill in some situations? Condemning Hamas does not mean ignoring the Palestinians‚Äô suffering. Over the years they have lost many lives including innocent children and women and every single one of them was a tragic loss. If we are able to say that about them then we should be able to say the same about Israeli children. Regardless of our politics.

instagram,"In the wake of the horrific attack on Israel, which has left over 700 dead, reports have surfaced that Iranian security officials helped the terrorist organization Hamas plan the strike for weeks.

‚ÄúIranian security officials helped plan Hamas‚Äôs Saturday surprise attack on Israel and gave the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut last Monday, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-backed militant group,‚Äù the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sunday.

Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officers as well as four Iran-sponsored terrorist groups, including Hamas, reportedly attended meetings in Beirut where the operation had been planned. U.S. officials have said they have not seen evidence of Tehran‚Äôs direct involvement in the attack.

‚ÄúWe have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack, but there is certainly a long relationship,‚Äù U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CNN.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any information at this time to corroborate this account,‚Äù a U.S. official said of the meetings.

Mahmoud Mirdawi, a senior Hamas official, has claimed that the group planned the attacks on its own. ‚ÄúThis is a Palestinian and Hamas decision,‚Äù he said. Iran‚Äôs supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, praised the attacks in a post on X. ‚ÄúZionist regime will be eradicated at the hands of the Palestinian people and the Resistance forces throughout the region,‚Äù he said.

More from the WSJ:

A direct Iranian role would take Tehran‚Äôs long-running conflict with Israel out of the shadows, raising the risk of broader conflict in the Middle East. Senior Israeli security officials have pledged to strike at Iran‚Äôs leadership if Tehran is found responsible for killing Israelis.

The IRGC‚Äôs broader plan is to create a multi-front threat that can strangle Israel from all sides‚ÄîHezbollah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the north and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, according to the senior Hamas and Hezbollah members and an Iranian official.

instagram,"As Hamas fighters crossed the border into Israel on Saturday, prompting Israeli forces to respond with air strikes on Gaza, social media had a clear function to play: Give people access to real-time, accurate information.

This function is especially important when it involves a complex conflict as historic, violent, and consequential as that between Israel and Hamas. Yet X in particular remains rife with misinformation and vitriol.

instagram,"In light of ongoing atrocities by the Islamic Republic on the people of Iran, their support of Hamas, and threats against British nationals, I met again with Security Minister @tomtugendhat to urge the UK government to implement policies to urgently address the root cause of these problems: the regime itself. This includes expulsion of regime officials and cronies, and holding the regime and IRGC to account for crimes against humanity and terrorism. And providing a safe haven for dissidents.

Update - My position on the conflict in the Middle East:

As an advocate for human rights, justice, freedom and peace, I stand firmly with all innocent civilians caught in the crossfires of terrorism and war.

I unequivocally condemn Hamas‚Äôs brutalities against the people of Israel. I also condemn them and their primary funder the Islamic Republic regime, for hostage taking and hiding behind their own people to achieve their political agendas. Let‚Äôs be clear, they do not care about the Palestinian or Iranian people or their rights. They know that their atrocities will lead to the devastation of their own people.¬†To defeat Hamas we must disempower its enabler, the Islamic Republic. 

In exercising its right to self-defense, Israel is bound by the rules of war and must distinguish itself from the non-state, designated terrorist organization Hamas, by not using indiscriminate force. It must not provide Hamas with more propaganda to use for radicalization. That is exactly what Hamas seeks to fan the flames of extremism. Breaking the cycle of perpetual violence takes extreme moral courage.¬†My heart breaks for every innocent life lost.",,16401,"{'like_count': 16229, 'comment_count': 172, 'num_users': 950747}",Nazanin Boniadi,,2023-10-09 17:04:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/316646183_2410759979081132_4826320314882948216_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=YTkl1jTGm6cAX8x-LDv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAZ71rOvZUXaE2TsY33klt2vKxP1H_c00_N0uEzHNOmJQ&oe=655ABC78,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyL46OjubRQ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386942109_3487620481566576_729720185675942517_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=uMeGV9qukYMAX9Wu-9w&_nc_oc=AQnRoiljSibs28tLkRYVUUz8qGBw0uKdMtFW47G2QCYNfT4SzYrrd8yKS2zG0Bpb_EM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDkGLE8DNg-1u6AEgHGgab8l1VdICvZ_zJ8KM1wOYL2Gw&oe=6559DFE7

instagram,"Correction: An earlier version of the article this post was adapted from incorrectly described Hamas‚Äôs aim as the creation of a Palestinian state along the borders that existed before the 1967 war. Hamas does not recognize the existence of Israel and is committed to replacing it through armed struggle with a Palestinian state stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River.

In addition, an earlier version of this post inaccurately characterized Qatar's relationship with Hamas. Qatar works with Hamas to provide humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza, but it does not directly support the group. That error has been removed.

---

Israel declared war against Hamas on Sunday following a surprise attack by the Palestinian militant group based in Gaza that included the taking of military and civilian hostages.

Israeli security forces, caught off-guard, have pounded the Gaza Strip with retaliatory strikes, and U.S. officials said they expect Israel to soon launch a ground incursion into the enclave as violence escalates in the conflict-ridden region.

Unlike the Palestinian Authority, Hamas does not recognize the existence of Israel and is committed to replacing it through armed struggle with a Palestinian state stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. In October 1997, the United States designated Hamas a terrorist organization.

instagram,"Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome missile shield is considered among the most advanced defence systems in the world.

It was specially designed to protect against a range of incoming short-range threats.

The Iron Dome uses radar to identify and destroy incoming threats before they can cause damage.

It can differentiate between missiles likely to hit built-up areas and those that won't. Static and mobile units only launch interceptor missiles to shoot down anything interpreted as dangerous.

The system became operational in 2011 and was developed by Israel with some US support.

Rockets used by Palestinian militant group Hamas often struggle to evade the Iron Dome system - but thousands were fired in a short space of time to overwhelm it on Saturday.

Hamas itself may not even know how many people were taken captive, or where they all are. It will want to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners, a practice that has a long history in the Israeli-Arab conflict.‚Å†

instagram,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel?  Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately.  Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.  But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.  Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.  And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.  And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.  Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.  But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13) 

The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7)  The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus.  The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets.  It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says.  Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God.  This is no time to follow popular opinions.  This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word.

instagram,"Israel declared war on Hamas on Sunday after it launched a surprise assault on Saturday. 

More than 700 Israelis and more than 400 Palestinians have died, with at least 2,300 wounded in Gaza; power cuts and a blockade have made medical care difficult for Palestinians. Hamas, which does not believe Israel should be a separate state, is also holding over 100 Israeli hostages in Gaza, which it controls.

Israel, founded in 1948, and Palestine claim the same area in western Asia. Millions of Palestinians have been displaced and seek self-determination. Others have called for a two-state solution. Yet, Israel has delayed resolution. About 2.1 million Palestinians live in Gaza and another 2.6 million live in the West Bank. 

The UN Security Council met on Sunday but did not take any action; all members needed to vote unanimously to do so.

Meanwhile, several #SouthAsian countries have commented on the conflict.

‚Ä¢ India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was ‚Äúdeeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel‚Ä¶.we stand in solidarity with Israel.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Bangladesh said it ‚Äúdenounces the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Palestine and deplores the resultant loss of innocent civilian lives (and) calls for immediate ceasefire.‚Äù It also said it ‚Äúsupports a two-state solution, Palestine and Israel, living side by side as independent states.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Pakistan said it is ‚Äúdeeply concerned by the escalating hostility‚Ä¶and the loss of innocent lives. We stand in solidarity with Palestinians and call for an immediate end to the violence and oppression by Israeli occupation forces‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Nepal issued a press statement about affected citizens: ‚ÄúTen Nepalis have tragically died due to an attack by the Palestinian Hamas group in a place called Kibbutz Alumim.‚Äù It said it ‚Äúcondemns the terrorist attack that occurred in Israel today that caused loss of precious human lives.‚Äù

instagram,"A surprise attack by Iran-backed Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, on Israel this past weekend has ignited geopolitical tensions. The impact of the war is set to be seen across the globe, including India. 

Gold prices have already begun to rise on increased haven demand amid tensions ramping up in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel. The precious metal gained as much as 1.2% today, as financial markets brace for headwinds and volatility from the shock attack by Gaza militants, as per a Bloomberg report.

Moreover, higher oil prices would increase inflation pressure and further weaken the Rupee, thus making gold an attractive investment option. This could drive up gold prices domestically.

Gold rate today, as per a Mint report, is witnessing strong buying interest due to rising uncertainty after the Israel-Palestine conflict. Gold price today on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) opened higher at ‚Çπ57,000 per 10 gm levels and went on to hit an intraday high of ‚Çπ57,400 levels within a few minutes of the commodity market's opening bell today.

As far as oil prices are concerned, they have surged as much as 5% after the broadest and bloodiest attack on Israel in decades. Brent crude ‚Äî the global oil benchmark ‚Äî jumped 4.94% to $88.76 a barrel on Monday. This bodes ill for India's state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) which have been forced to keep the retail fuel prices unchanged ahead of the general elections in 2024.

High crude oil prices will weaken the profitability of the three government-owned oil marketing companies in India ‚Äî Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, according to Moody's.

On Monday, shares of Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp are all down around 2-3%.

instagram,"Baldwin IV, the 12th-century King of Jerusalem, faced a formidable adversary from a young age. Afflicted by leprosy, he ascended to the throne at the tender age of 13. Despite the physical toll of his ailment, Baldwin IV displayed exceptional courage and strategic brilliance. Known as the ""Leprous King,"" he valiantly led his forces against the renowned Muslim general, Saladin.

Baldwin's reign was marked by intense conflict, including the famous Battle of Montgisard in 1177. Despite being outnumbered, the young king,  who was 16 at the time, devised a daring plan, surprising Saladin's forces and achieving a remarkable victory. His tenacity and leadership earned him respect even from his adversaries.

The challenges posed by leprosy, however, were relentless. As his health deteriorated, Baldwin struggled to maintain stability in the kingdom. Despite his condition, he demonstrated a commitment to his people, making significant efforts to secure the realm's future.

Baldwin IV's story is one of resilience, leadership, and sacrifice. Despite facing insurmountable odds, he left an indelible mark on history, remembered not only for his military triumphs but also for his unwavering dedication to his kingdom in the face of a debilitating illness.ü™∂

Because the violence never stopped.

It is an absolute embarrassment seeing those who shrugged their shoulders for years, all of a sudden leap to TV, radio and social media platforms in their droves to support yet another quest of war.

It's insane.

Sexual violence in conflict zones is a war crime and is one of the most disgusting and unjustifiable acts possible.

instagram,"On October 8, 2023, Palestinians in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, experienced a tragic scene as they inspected the ruins of a mosque destroyed by an Israeli attack. Local sources reported that Israeli warplanes targeted this mosque as part of the ongoing conflict in the region. The conflict stems from Hamas' launch of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm in response to the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and escalating violence by Israeli settlers. During the conflict, Hamas reportedly fired rockets and captured several Israelis. 

In response to the attacks, the Israeli army began Operation Iron Sword. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced, ""We are at war,"" while urging civilians in Gaza to leave the territory as the Israeli military planned to reduce ""all Hamas hideouts to rubble."" Amid the ruins of the destroyed mosque, a number of residents attempted to remove debris and responded with concern for possible casualties from the attack. The prolonged Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to cause suffering and destruction in the region.

We are closely monitoring the action on ground which is concentrated in South Israel, whereas Haifa port is situated in the North. We have taken measures to ensure safety of our employees and all of them are safe. We remain fully alert and prepared with a business continuity plan that will enable us to respond effectively to any eventuality.""

‚ÄúThe overall contribution of Haifa in APSEZ‚Äôs numbers is relatively small at 3% of the total cargo volume. For the current financial year (Apr 23-Mar 24), we have guided for Haifa Cargo volumes range of 10-12 MMT and APSEZ‚Äôs total cargo volume guidance of 370-390 MMT. In the initial six months (Apr-Sep 23), APSEZ‚Äôs total cargo volume was ~203 MMT, of which the Haifa share is ~6 MMT. We stay confident of APSEZs business performance,"" it added.

After hours of intense bombardment by Israeli jets, Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza, said it would execute an Israeli captive for every Israeli bombing of a civilian house without warning.

instagram,"""The holy Bible may preach peace, but when it is Christendom itself that is threatened, it is every Christian's duty to defend all that is holy. His Holiness, the Pope, has called a Crusade to reclaim the Holy Lands from the infidel, who would deny Christian pilgrims their right to visit the holy places. It is time for the armies of Christendom to put aside their differences and unite under one banner - the Sign of the Cross - and give back God's children what is rightfully theirs...or die trying.""

instagram,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel?  Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately.  Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.  But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.  Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.  And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.  And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.  Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.  But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13)  The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7)  The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus.  The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets.  It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says.  Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God.  This is no time to follow popular opinions.  This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word.

instagram,"#BREAKING ƒ§@m@·π£ announces it will execute hostages/""settlers"" for every Israeli bombing of civilian buildings that doesn't include ""roof knocking"" prior warnings and kills civilians, and will publish footage of the executions and names of the executed online, says spokesperson for the Gaza militant faction in new statement. 

(Update: A senior official said the militant group is open to discussions over a possible truce with Israel, having ""achieved its targets."" He told Al Jazeera in a phone interview that the group was open to a ceasfire ""something of that sort"" and ""all political dialogues"")

This comes as IDF bombing of Gaza is reportedly five times as much as during 2006 Lebanese conflict says IDF spokesperson.

""In a press conference, IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari says some 60 fighter jets are carrying out waves of airstrikes against leading Gaza militant targets at this hour. He says the military has completed the evacuation of the towns adjacent to the border and that there are a few families who have chosen to stay.

Hagari says troops are still going from house to house in towns close to the Gaza border, searching for fighters. ""There are no terr@r!sts crossing the fence from Gaza into Israel,"" he says, noting that they are being struck by the IAF. ""Since this morning there have been a few encounters with terr@r!sts, there have been none at all in the last few hours,"" Hagari says.

Regarding the armed infiltration from Lebanon, Hagari says the identities of the gunmen are still under investigation. Another militant faction claimed responsibility for the attack. On Israeli hostages held in Gaza, Hagari says the army has ""the full details"" on all of those taken captive by the terror group.

""As of now, we have notified 30 families. When we complete notifying the families, the number of hostages in Gaza will be made available to the public,"" he says."" Via https://twitter.com/manniefabian/status/1711425206865076366

instagram,"#BREAKING ƒ§@m@·π£ announces it will execute hostages/""settlers"" for every Israeli bombing of civilian buildings that doesn't include ""roof knocking"" prior warnings and kills civilians, and will publish footage of the executions and names of the executed online, says spokesperson for the Gaza militant faction in new statement. 

(Update: A senior official said the militant group is open to discussions over a possible truce with Israel, having ""achieved its targets."" He told Al Jazeera in a phone interview that the group was open to a ceasfire ""something of that sort"" and ""all political dialogues"")

This comes as IDF bombing of Gaza is reportedly five times as much as during 2006 Lebanese conflict says IDF spokesperson.

""In a press conference, IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari says some 60 fighter jets are carrying out waves of airstrikes against leading Gaza militant targets at this hour. He says the military has completed the evacuation of the towns adjacent to the border and that there are a few families who have chosen to stay.

Hagari says troops are still going from house to house in towns close to the Gaza border, searching for fighters. ""There are no terr@r!sts crossing the fence from Gaza into Israel,"" he says, noting that they are being struck by the IAF. ""Since this morning there have been a few encounters with terr@r!sts, there have been none at all in the last few hours,"" Hagari says.

Regarding the armed infiltration from Lebanon, Hagari says the identities of the gunmen are still under investigation. Another militant faction claimed responsibility for the attack. On Israeli hostages held in Gaza, Hagari says the army has ""the full details"" on all of those taken captive by the terror group.

""As of now, we have notified 30 families. When we complete notifying the families, the number of hostages in Gaza will be made available to the public,"" he says."" Via https://twitter.com/manniefabian/status/1711425206865076366

Several Indians living in Israel are working as caregivers, but there are also about a thousand students, several IT professionals and diamond traders. Some businessmen visiting Israel are stranded in the conflict and are waiting to be evacuated soon.

instagram,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was 'deeply distressed' by Israel's announcement of a complete siege on the Gaza Strip.

""The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities. Now, it will only deteriorate exponentially,"" Guterres said.

""This most recent violence does not come in a vacuum,"" Guterres stressed. ""The reality is that it grows out of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year-long occupation and no political end in sight."" 

Guterres reiterated calls for a negotiated peace and two-state solution, saying ""it is time to end this vicious circle of bloodshed, hatred and polarization.""

Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a ""complete siege"" of Gaza.

Gallant said the new measures will cut electricity and include a ban on admitting food and fuel.

Guterres urged all sides to allow the UN access to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinians trapped in Gaza.

instagram,"‚ÄúFor the first time in decades, Israel called the conflict with Palestinians a state of war.

But for Palestinians, being at war is an enduring reality that has shaped their daily lives for the past seven decades.

Since the Palestinian Nakba in 1948, which resulted in the forcible displacement of 750,000 Palestinians from their towns and villages, successive Israeli governments have committed hundreds of human rights violations, including ethnic cleansing, apartheid, and mass killings, all of which amount to war crimes according to international law.

While Palestinians have long said that Israel‚Äôs practices are part of a war waged against their very existence, Israel has managed to get away with its violations, enjoying complete impunity that has lasted for more than 75 years.

At 6.30am on Saturday, residents in Gaza were abruptly awakened by the sound of explosions reverberating through the blockaded Strip. By this time, it was not another Israeli military assault; rather, it was barrages of Palestinian homemade rockets launched towards several towns and cities in Israel.

While the attack is described as ‚Äòsurprising‚Äô by many, an escalation of events was undoubtedly expected, given Israel‚Äôs tightening of restrictions and the rise in assaults across the occupied Palestinian territories during the past few months.

This rise in Israeli military and settler brutality signifies an unprecedented level of violence across all the Palestinian territories, fueled and encouraged by a troubling sense of impunity and a lack of accountability for those responsible.

Residents of Gaza have been talking of a fresh escalation since the early months of 2023: those discussions became ever more prominent both during and following each Israeli surge in violence in the occupied territories.

And for them, the attack by Palestinian armed factions against Israel this weekend was not so much a surprise in concept as in scale and nature, both of which were unprecedented in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.‚Äù

instagram,"I love (love!!) this quote by @sitwithsharon ‚Äî go follow her for more! I often talk about people-pleasing isn‚Äôt really about pleasing people; it‚Äôs how we learned to stay physically, emotionally, or socially safe. But this coping mechanism we learned in the past wreaks havoc on our relationships in the present. 

Ultimately, people-pleasing‚Äôs inevitable consequences‚Äîyears‚Äô worth of resentment, avoidance, conflict aversion, and unspoken grievances‚Äîinhibit us from truly connecting with the very people we care about. They also prevent others from knowing who we really are.

True intimacy requires that we release our stronghold on this outdated coping mechanism. It requires that we share the depths of our own passions and dreams. It demands that we are honest about what we feel and need, even when it‚Äôs hard. Ultimately, accepting the invitation to intimacy means bringing more self to our relationships after years of bringing less. 

THIS Thursday, October 12, join me at my new talk, Using Fierce Compassion to Stop People-Pleasing and Start Being Real, where we‚Äôll discover how we leverage our natural care and compassion for others as tools to break the people-pleasing pattern once and for all. Get your tickets today at the link in my bio. (Can‚Äôt make it live? A ticket gets you access to the recording afterwards!)

instagram,"Pope Francis and the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem called for peace after Israel declared ‚Äúwar‚Äù following a major attack by Hamas fighters over the weekend.‚Å£
‚Å£
The pope said at the end of a public address on Sunday he is following the violence ‚Äúwith apprehension and sorrow,‚Äù and issued an appeal to ‚Äúplease stop weapons attacks!‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
The head of the Catholic Church in Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, called for a de-escalation of the situation in a statement Oct. 7.‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúThe continuing bloodshed and declarations of war remind us once again of the urgent need to find a lasting and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in this land,‚Äù he said.‚Å£
‚Å£
A series of rocket attacks and incursions on Israel from Hamas militants had reportedly killed hundreds and wounded many between Saturday and Sunday morning.‚Å£
‚Å£
The surprise attacks began early on the morning of Oct. 7, the start of the observance of the Jewish holiday Simchat Torah.‚Å£
‚Å£
Israel reacted to the attacks by fighting back in southern Israel and launching airstrikes in Gaza. Israeli military official Daniel Hagari told reporters Sunday morning that ‚Äúhundreds of terrorists‚Äù had been killed during fighting in Gaza and southern Israel, the Associated Press reported.‚Å£
‚Å£
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday Israel is ‚Äúat war.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
In an appeal at the end of his Sunday Angelus address, Pope Francis said ‚Äúterrorism and war do not bring any solution, but only death and suffering for many innocent people. War is a failure. Every war is a failure.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
He said he is close to the families of the victims and called for prayers ‚Äúthat there will be peace in Israel and Palestine.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
The pope also recalled that the month of October is dedicated to the rosary, and asked Catholics to continue to pray through the intercession of Mary ‚Äúfor the gift of peace for the many countries of the world marked by war and conflict.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
Pizzaballa, who was created a cardinal by Pope Francis in a consistory Sept. 30, called the sudden outbreak of violence in Israel and Palestine ‚Äúvery concerning due to its extension and intensity.‚Äù‚Å£

instagram,"The U.S. has already begun delivering munitions and military equipment to Israel, and the Pentagon is reviewing inventories to see what else can be sent quickly to boost its ally in the three-day-old war with Hamas, a senior Defense Department official said Monday.

Planes have already taken off, said the official, who declined to provide details on the weapons. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive shipments, also warned that the U.S. is closely watching Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed groups, noting that the decision to shift American ships in the region was to deter any of them from entering or expanding the conflict against Israel.

The weapons movement came as President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. death toll in the war has gone up to 11.

The official said the U.S. is ‚Äúflooding the zone‚Äù with calls and other messages so that extremist groups and other nations know they should not question America‚Äôs commitment to supporting the defense of Israel. The official, however, would not comment on whether U.S. military forces would be used at all. - AP",,5615,"{'like_count': 5022, 'comment_count': 593, 'num_users': 170289}",TCD News,,2023-10-09 22:04:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/391270375_1380968379153634_7150394767222209336_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=1bw3fj9vJJEAX8uPM2X&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCdps30DwCZIYYRyZhfrrYJ1H2zq0wCqg3Ulb13IGwJjw&oe=655B8DEC,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMbPQPur-C/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387732984_1526912048128524_6983677093663176550_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CgBsiMU6sYAAX8-MXeJ&_nc_oc=AQlRSFM4Ivun1CKY2QJBYL7wqarMYhDIzvFg2mLJEnqO5IhXGM_ie8htCbdojD16VMI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBLN-T_TrCC8qTwfofwuhfZtW962X8fK8WAzF7vz03xiA&oe=6530DE22

‚Å£
‚ÄúI join with Pope Francis in his call for peace and his condemnation of this widespread outbreak of violence,‚Äù Malloy said.‚Å£

‚Å£
‚ÄúMay all who love the Holy Land seek to bring about among all the parties engaged in the fighting a cessation of violence, respect for civilian populations and the release of hostages,‚Äù Malloy urged. ‚Å£
‚Å£
The strike by Hamas resulted in hundreds of Israeli deaths, as well as reports of Hamas insurgents roaming through Israeli neighborhoods and allegedly abducting citizens there. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari indicated on Monday that the country was prepared for a lengthy siege, claiming that the IDF was ‚Äúin the midst of wide-scale aerial strikes‚Äù and that ‚Äúthousands of terrorist targets have been struck and hundreds of terrorists have been neutralized.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúWe have called in 300,000 reservists over the past 48 hours, and there is no lack in equipment or food,‚Äù Hagari said. ‚ÄúEverything will come, patience is essential.‚Äù‚Å£

instagram,"Misunderstanding is a complex and sometimes hurtful emotion that we all experience at some point in our lives. It's that feeling when someone interprets our words or actions in a way we never intended, leading to confusion and sometimes even conflict.

Sending a message that was misread, saying something innocently that was taken the wrong way, or trying to explain our viewpoint but being met with resistance instead of understanding. It's like a knot in our chest, tightening with every passing moment, making us question our ability to convey our intentions. 

It's essential to remember that communication is a two-way street. It's easy to feel hurt or defensive but taking a step back and approaching the situation with empathy can lead to a resolution.

It's crucial to have open and honest conversations, allowing space for clarifications and explanations. 

Understanding that it's natural for misunderstandings to occur, and we all have our own perspectives. Instead of pointing fingers, let's strive to listen actively, seek to understand, and extend the benefit of doubt.

Remember, words have power, but misinterpretations can arise irrespective of our intentions. A warm smile can go a long way in bridging the gap caused by misunderstandings. 

Let's make an effort to be patient, loving, and compassionate towards one another, acknowledging that we are all unique individuals trying to navigate this complex world.

Next time you find yourself caught in a web of misunderstanding, take a deep breath, and remind yourself that clarity can be achieved if both parties are willing to communicate with an open heart and an open mind.

.
.
Slides 1&2: Who gets called a terrorist? and who gets their terrorist called a mistake and a manifestation of their mental health?
.
. 
Slides 3-4: How YT supremacy culture whitewashes leftist movements and conversations while simultaneously romanticizing colonial structures. 
.
.
Slides (5&6) Screenshots of the discussion in my stories covering the overwhelming defense of Israel by YT women while many ignore the violence against Palestinians. Slide 5 was written by a YT Jewish woman who is anti-Zionist. Slide 6 is written by a woman who was raised in Christianity. I think these comments show how slides 3&4 manifest in how people respond to media coverage of this current conflict.

Slide 7: This is self-explanatory and hopefully asks y'all to reflect. Thank you @theandrehenry for your concise contributions and questions.

Edit: I'm putting this here for any people who will read this post and undoubtedly not look at anything else. As I said in the pinned comment below.

Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns as the country suffered its bloodiest day in decades on Saturday. Israel battered Palestinians with air strikes in Gaza on Sunday, with hundreds reportedly killed on both sides. The spiraling violence threatens to start a major new war in the Middle East.‚Å†

At least three Americans were among those killed, CNN reported on Sunday, citing a U.S. memo.‚Å†

Austin in a statement said he ordered the moving of the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean closer to Israel. The force includes the carrier, a guided missile cruiser and four guided missile destroyers.‚Å†
‚Å†
Austin also said the United States had also taken steps to augment U.S. Air Force F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter aircraft squadrons in the region. He said the United States would also provide munitions to Israel.‚Å†

Ambassador Tuggar said that the cycle of v#olence and retaliation that the current escalation has assumed only ‚Äúserved to perpetuate an unending cycle of pain and suffering for the civilian population, it consequently called for ceasefire in the interest of the vulnerable civilians.

‚ÄúThe government also called for restraint and the need to prioritise the safety of civilians by giving room for humanitarian considerations.‚Äù The Federal Government of Nigeria is deeply concerned about the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in the early hours of Saturday, 7th October, 2023 and calls for de-escalation and ceasefire.

instagram,"FG calls for ceasefire between Israel and Hamas 

 The Federal Government has called for de-escalation of hostilities in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

A statement issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf¬† Tuggar, said it was deeply concerned about the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas yesterday in Abuja.

Ambassador Tuggar said that the cycle of v#olence and retaliation that the current escalation has assumed only ‚Äúserved to perpetuate an unending cycle of pain and suffering for the civilian population, it consequently called for ceasefire in the interest of the vulnerable civilians.

‚ÄúThe government also called for restraint and the need to prioritise the safety of civilians by giving room for humanitarian considerations.‚Äù The Federal Government of Nigeria is deeply concerned about the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in the early hours of Saturday, 7th October, 2023 and calls for de-escalation and ceasefire.

‚ÄúThe cycle of v#olence and retaliation that the current escalation has assumed, only serves to perpetuate an unending cycle of p@in and s¬•ffering for the civilian population, that bear the brunt of every conflict.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Federal Government of Nigeria, therefore, calls on both sides to exercise restraint, prioritize the safety of civilians and give room for humanitarian considerations. We are therefore calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue.‚Äù",,4476,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 4476, 'num_users': 527168}",Instablog9ja,,2023-10-09 07:54:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323742370_219716873759955_508253261971726743_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KReNdkWc118AX_Z9Hhz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA7PeBPWjWlxaN4v7QYp3WQxkKp12_EYHmoaYtxsSrbqw&oe=655AC7AD,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyK5_Lfs7dp/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387726174_844452450669972_1035705416285642964_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=8Rjch1l4U00AX_urHfR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBE6LAgPkeDdpdRXtJch0Is7p2ck89NIEmn9Q5m8c-dUQ&oe=6528597E
instagram,"A lot of new people have started following me in regard to the current events in Israel. I would like to introduce myself to those who have not heard of me before: I AM NOT AN ACTIVIST. 

I am first and foremost a novelist. A writer. A journalist. I don't want to educate. I want to sit in my bed and invent protagonists and weird stories and read books and listen to music and dream. I was born and raised in Berlin, East-Berlin, when there was still a different state and a wall. My father is Jewish and I have cleared my halachical status through a German Beit Din. Therefore I am Jewish and member of the Jewish Community in Germany. In 1991 I traveled to Israel the very first time to meet my family and flew back over and over again. So I know this country for 32 years. Since ten years I am living between Berlin and Tel Aviv. I have an 8 years old German-Israeli daughter. 

In 2015 my first novel was published by @sfischerverlage called ""Wintern√§he"" in which I write about the Israeli-Arab-conflict, Jewish identity and antisemitism. If you'd read it now, you had the feeling it was written yesterday. Which is odd even to me. For years I have been writing for basically all German newspapers and magazines covering topics like feminism, Jewish life in Germany, financial freedom and sex. So basically I write about sex, money and Jews. My bones are filled with humor, my heart with optimism, my brain with curiosity. I studied Philosophy and History at Humboldt University. And I really really really do not want to share one gruesome story about the massacre that started October 7, 2023 again but I have to. üíîüáÆüá±",,4372,"{'like_count': 4204, 'comment_count': 168, 'num_users': 42718}",Mirna Funk,,2023-10-09 09:14:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/365431309_1612409849164578_3535788130741094479_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ho-TWfanGjEAX96uaBJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDj47jNFrTRwRbHJuMk6ztwCBSijVH-WRP7LsSMjkwIMA&oe=655AE110,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLDJR0shdR/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386909989_325770936809969_6505316647524249143_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=61H9owBYrVQAX_8vuWI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDqtKnGfF69HQ7spQjbCHuDgP-9VxiBOu6PopKppEITPw&oe=655A0FF7

instagram,"This past couple days have been so heavy for the psy community & i wanted to bring some light to the situation.

We are a collective of people trying our absolute best to make this world a better place even in the smallest ways. Once or twice a year we gather in remote parts of the world to share love, ideas & movement thru the art of dance. 
We are peaceful people. 
None of us would harm a fly.

To have our tribe decimated by men who want to cause terror is truly so saddening & feels like a direct attack on Good. 
It‚Äôs simply Good VS Evil in these moments. 

This terror attack has pointed a spotlight at our community & it‚Äôs how we act in these moments that makes all the difference. We cannot chastise the murderers or wish harm on them because that is simply mirroring their behaviour & nothing good comes from violence on violence. 
No one wins there. 
There is only suffering. 
We must be the better people as we always strive to be & show love to all. That‚Äôs our core belief & we can‚Äôt change that now.

My prayers & love go to everyone who attended that festival near the gaza border. I am thankful so many survived & escaped. I wish a safe return to all the hostages & wounded still in hiding. 

These photos are from 2 months ago where i danced with our tribe & showed love to all no matter their background or beliefs. I hope we can all return to that soon despite this huge hole in our hearts.üíî

RIP to @shanukkk, she was my german friend, i watched her body being paraded around in the back of a truck in a video before realising who it was. Such a horrific image now burned into my mind. No one deserves to be treated like that. She had nothing to do with the conflict in that area. None of them did.

instagram,"There are a lot of people online talking about the Israel-Palestine conflict right now. People are picking sides (because that's what we do). Israeli forces have ramped up attacks following an attack from Hamas. Netanyahu is promising that his response will change the future of the occupation and conflict. But, Palestinian resistance forces and Hamas have never had the military power or global support Israel has. Nor have the Palestinian people currently living on occupied lands on the Gaza Strip ever really had freedom of movement and safety (or nationhood) they deserve. We are watching genocide happen.

People are using ideological shortcuts to determine when violence is justified, necessary, or warranted.

Rather than enter a political debate that predates me and that I have not, myself, participated in organizing around, I would rather just focus on the ways that we condone violence and genocide when powerful people, institutions, and nations suggest its the only way forward. 

We hold space for violence when it's enacted by countries with asymmetric military power, nuclear arms, and political cache among other developed nations. We are fine with violence when it preserves the status quo and keeps our existing political relationships intact.

It's only when marginalized and oppressed people defend themselves that we see calls to end the violence. Protestors are cast as aggressors when their goal is merely survival. 

This is the colonial project at work. Notice it. Call it out. There are people who cannot speak in this moment. 

This is not about our political beliefs and sides. It's about the belief that human beings deserve to live and live fully.

Tweet grabs: Whenever Black and Brown people resist oppression, we are cast as violent, aggressive, and riotous. But, the oppressors are silent about the violence they've enacted, typically for generations.

This is how colonization works. Rewriting history is central to this process.

When you chastise oppressed people for resisting because ""it will make things harder for them,"" you're siding with the oppressors.",,4110,"{'like_count': 4060, 'comment_count': 50, 'num_users': 21149}",dr. jenn m. jackson,,2023-10-09 12:43:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/386231796_336130848777582_4795347683956353471_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=QdkKzBk1xcwAX9kecW-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDleB5ptXcoXGRiC_r25LJjPYQ8JpK3QOXPopd38GJ_2Q&oe=655A0E4A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLbDU7u2I1/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387714831_1702794526872367_4292393965677006280_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=cJ5JImJJpxYAX9q4CC5&_nc_oc=AQmOc2a6DeKSH_OilfEO8Rq_GuNWZ0cAu_Z4sq_tCvF7lymJ-AWF5swcn3GwLyEmKyA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB2u_EciB5p-_QP9J0lF1n34c9PL8spGmUvYXvAfPg1qg&oe=655A8A95
instagram,"#Netanyahu said his country was now at ‚Äúwar‚Äô‚Äô with #Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by #Israel and the US. Though understandable, or even inevitable, given the moment, this wasn‚Äôt a good sign. Wars demand clear battlefield victories that don‚Äôt necessarily bring strategic ones, and Israel‚Äôs strategic priority right now should be containment. This conflict could grow a lot worse if allowed.

The more substantive part of Netanyahu‚Äôs statement on Saturday was hard to fault. He divided his prescription for the days and weeks ahead into three parts: First, clear Hamas fighters from Israeli territory and restore security to the border; second, exact a price from Hamas, including in #Gaza, while securing other borders to ensure nobody else attacks; and finally, unite and remain level-headed. It's the second and third parts that will be hard to stick to, so let‚Äôs take them one at a time.

instagram,"On Saturday, Hamas launched and executed a multi faceted attack on innocent people. Terrorists indiscriminately killed men, women, and the most vulnerable in society - babies and the elderly. They raped, tortured and murdered young adults at a music festival for peace in cold blood. They targeted everyone regardless of who they were. If any of you were there, dancing in the desert, your life would have been taken. They are now holding and threatening to kill hundreds of hostages - kids, parents, grandparents, and mums with babies. It is barbaric and gut-wrenching.

instagram,"For two decades now, our tie to Israel through our strategic partner Haifa Chemicals has grown rooted in mutual respect and understanding. We‚Äôve forged many close relationships. And the recent turmoil in the region touches our hearts deeply.

Hamas‚Äôs actions are undeniably tragic, brutal, and absolutely unacceptable.

The assault resulted in over a thousand casualties, with the toll still rising. The taking of hostages and the loss of so many innocents is profoundly troubling.

Israel has admirably weathered numerous challenges, consistently striving for peace. Such tenacity merits our unwavering support, now more than ever.

We resolutely stand with Israel, condemning the violence, and earnestly hope for a swift end to this conflict. We remain with those affected and urge united efforts for regional peace

The gravity of this situation serves as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of unity and peace.

instagram,"Living in multicultural Australia means I‚Äôm exposed directly to the heartbreaking stories of ethnic conflict from all corners of the world. Without having the livid experience of being those people and sharing that history, there is only so much I can understand about their deep rooted personal and historical desire to fight for or defend what they see as their homeland. As an individual I‚Äôm sympathetic to my friends from around the world and think how blessed we are to be in a country that shows our differences have very little to do with how we can all live together in peace. 

Living in Australia also means that we are a part of civilised society that condemn acts of savagery and barbarism. We have our own moral and ethical aspirations to be people who despite the conflict, value human life, especially the protection of innocent civilian life at all times. Even when our own nation fails to meet these standards we condemn it and seek to hold our own accountable. 

It is shameful that there are those in my country, including political parties, movements and their leaders who are unable to rise to this standard today. 

If you are standing in solidarity with the savagery of directly slaughtering civilians, the parading of mutilated corpses, the hostage taking and rape of women and children as acceptable forms of resistance and defence, please think long and hard about what you are endorsing. 

It is worrying that so many here in Australia that are not linked to this conflict by ethnicity or history are unable to be rational and think clearly during a time like this. 

If we also rise to the depths of an eye for an eye bloodlust that excuses acts of savagery against innocents, there is not a hope in the world for the people directly impacted by those conflicts.",,3461,"{'like_count': 2777, 'comment_count': 684, 'num_users': 94213}",Rukshan Fernando,,2023-10-09 01:29:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/243550818_147386347601785_7030819563720572569_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4Z6n-jsFI-wAX9H88S7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAIOQxh4Q19C55WTgHh1P5vgUWHneiOtYUfA7AhHBheLg&oe=6559B52D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyKN-cgPxO_/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/387752564_17995004453329320_1381320307411613231_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4bvhpKzHJFEAX87xq1A&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAV6v6dcBBaYZGQsUCgXion_MUVQMma22c-N2CNnPb2ow&oe=6558E971

- The decision to terminate talks was conveyed to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, marking a setback to recent US efforts to broker peace and diplomatic ties between the two nations.

- The reasons behind this sudden change in position are not yet fully understood, but speculation suggests that the recent escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine may have played a role.

- The conflict has sparked global outrage and protests, increasing pressure on nations to take a clear stance.

instagram,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel?  Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately.  Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.  But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.  Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.  And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.  And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.  Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.  But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13)  The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7)  The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus.  The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets.  It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says.  Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God.  This is no time to follow popular opinions.  This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word.

instagram,"Israel pounded Gaza on Sunday, killing hundreds of people in retaliation for one of the bloodiest attacks in its history after Hamas killed 700 Israelis and abducted dozens more.

Hamas fighters' rampage through Israeli towns on Saturday was the deadliest such incursion since Egypt and Syria's attacks in the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago and has threatened to ignite another conflagration in the long-running conflict.

instagram,"One of the most common situations which may happen to any thinker is undoubtedly doubting his own principles and opinions that often have to be met with the pressure of opposing ideas. According to Friedrich Nietzsche, tired people are more susceptible to ideas, which were defeated by them some time ago, because during this period man exposes himself to an apparently positive influence which, in fact, should never be allowed to speak again seriously for the reason of giving people pure illusions without any piece of truth from reality. Nonetheless, a great deal of people consider this state to be extremely useful and crucial to our development, as it undermines our current views, forcing us to intelligently defend our most important claims. Although in theory we fight the same views, constantly, new counter-arguments along with dilemmas appear in our consciousness, concluding with the direct conflict of our values with foreign concepts. So does the feeling of fatigue, bringing old ideas down on us, directly harm people? Or maybe it is a test that is an ideal opportunity for future¬† development?
_
Generally speaking, I would be more likely to agree with the second group about the properties of the event as a whole. By returning old ideas in a new form, man is able to show his willpower in the face of an overnight threat, which practically never forgives us, while always pushing our interior until one side finally wins. Of course, one possible scenario is that the person will be¬† possessed by persuasive and sinister views, but in most cases the risk is worth the potential gains. Therefore, despite the numerous dangers to which fatigue exposes us, including prevalent illusions such as popular truisms, a man should definitely oppose the slightest sign of them in order to crystallize his own courage and strengthen the power of his arguments or abandon his current principles for the sake of more meaningful statements.

(For all haters already writing disgusting things in comments, I made demo and protest in Hebron, beside the Palestinians, facing the IDF and illegal settlers some years ago.) 
all my thoughts and feelings for all victims of the raid from Hamas against Israel this weekend.
Even if all victims matter, a special thought for people who were killed, injured, raped or kidnapped at the trance festival @super nova festival. 
( 260 dead bodies found at the festival, about 150 kidnapped ... üñ§üñ§
Especially because the electronic scene use to spread values of peace and unity, with no matter of origins, color of skin, sexual orientation, genre, religion, territory...
Why this Hamas attacked them, what was the purpose? While many of attendees of the festival were pro-palestinian,... Why??? üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
And without being part of the conflict between extremists, I know many Israeli who don't support the political actions of their government, as not all Palestinians don't support the Hamas actions.

I am witnessing this sad conflict since my childhood, and personally condemn violence on both side, within the hope and dream that one day will be finally the peace.

instagram,"My heart goes out to all the humans suffering, the Israeli and the Palestinian civilians who have, are currently, and will continue to experience unimaginable harm. The terrorist attack on Israel is deeply personal and devastating. 
In this particular conflict, before I go into developmental messages to help you decide what and when to share horrific events with your children, I want to explain a concept in psychology that may help you have these hard conversations. In particular, this applies to conversations which require empathy and complexity. One important concept in psychology and mental health is the dialectic. A dialectic allows for the idea that  two seemingly opposing things can be true at the same time. Our children need to understand this concept now more than ever - something they can only do when they witness the adults in their lives thinking in this way. Please do not post hateful comments, this is not the space. I am just trying to provide language for making your own decisions about how best to speak with and support kids who are NOT directly impacted. This is an IG post so do not ask me to go into the thousands of years of history that led to this. I am explaining how to discuss with kids in 9 short sentences on Instagram. I will trust you can each do your own homework and determine how best and when to include details. This is not going to be a history lesson.

instagram,"After the start of this most recent war in Israel, I‚Äôve seen people make some wild and uneducated assumptions on where weapons used by Palestinian armed groups come from.

The majority of the fighting happening in early October in 2023 in Israel / Palestine is happening around Gaza. 

There are a fewer number of AR15 pattern assault rifles in the hands of armed groups in Gaza than there are in Groups based in ‚Äúrefugee camps‚Äù in the West Bank. This is because Gaza has a ocean border and land border with Egypt, meaning other arms besides IDF ‚ÄúM4‚Äôs‚Äù are easier to acquire via smuggling than they are in the more heavily Israeli controlled West Bank.

A majority of AR15s used by armed Palestinian groups actually came from Israel via theft, corruption, or capture during a conflict. The few AR15s that are not from the IDF are usually older M16A1 or M16A2 pattern rifles or carbines that are smuggled into Gaza.

Most of these AR15s in the hands of armed Palestinian groups do vaguely resemble ‚ÄúM4‚Äôs‚Äù, but are in fact mainly M16A1 rifles that have been converted into carbines by the IDF. Some of these are modified further by Palestinians such as the rifle in slide 4 which has had its fixed carry handle removed. Companies like DS Arms in the United States provided the Israelis with ‚Äúupgrade kits‚Äù to turn M16A1 assault rifles & other older carbines into more modern ‚Äúflat top‚Äù AR15 carbines.

Some AR15s used by Palestinian groups are actually not AR15s, but just look the part from a distance. Slide 5 & 6 show a 9x19mm carbine that is designed to vaguely look like an AR15.

In reality, the AR15 is not the primary rifle of armed groups in Gaza, as the AK is way more prolific in the area.",,2369,"{'like_count': 2268, 'comment_count': 101, 'num_users': 17022}",Dixie,,2023-10-09 17:57:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/295569405_391143293003342_1535715752580208850_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=wiS65LDx5TAAX_lkkWV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAN8TXVZs1GjHiBOSq3TeYYWlIoI1JKYGkanTs9t6-slw&oe=655A01E3,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyL--OiL4nP/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387255593_847688947035175_8367921849548056933_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=GC-viMUXHZ8AX9AGfbh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBczQowaN7dpaVtddVLBoklm5tTHgnPa3JHxVfGqxQQqA&oe=653104D8

He said the AIMIM is fully prepared for these elections and expressed confidence that the people will support his party for its work, accessibility and availability, particularly in Telangana.

Dismissing allegations that his party acts like a B team for the BRS, Owaisi said MIM supported former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government between 2004 and 2014.

Responding to a query, Owaisi said they have already demanded the BJP-led central government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to conduct caste census in the entire country.

To another query on the conflict between Hamas and Israel, he alleged ""Israel is the oppressor there and Palestinians are oppressed.

This is a complex issue that spans decades and centuries of history, and one we are not qualified to cover on besides affirming our stance that violence, forced displacement and war are not the solution on either side of the conflict.

instagram,"Unprovoked?! This is a disgraceful statement from Defence Minister Richard Marles. It is also appalling that tonight the Opera House will be lit up in support of Israel - what about all of the Palestinian lives lost since occupation? What about the Palestinian Australian community mourning their loved ones? What about the decades upon decades of human rights violations against Palestinian people?

I am disgusted at both state and federal Labor Governments for their actions in relation to this. But also I guess we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised - because after all they too rule over a land still marked with the bloodstains of invasion and colonisation without any end to the injustice for First Nations people.

Today and every day, I stand in solidarity and defiance with Palestinian people here and across the globe. 

And urge you all to listen to the voices of Palestinian people - and human rights organisations - who are providing much needed perspective as well as  current historical context for the current escalation.

A statement issued by Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights is calling on the Member States of the UN Security Council to:

1. Recognize and condemn Israel‚Äôs illegal occupation, settler-colonialism, and apartheid regime as the root causes underpinning the continuous waves of conflict in the territory;

2. Demand Israel‚Äôs immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, as required in UN resolutions since 1967; 

3. Call for the dismantling of Israel‚Äôs settler colonial apartheid regime on both sides of the Green Line;

4. Take concrete steps to ensure the protection of the Palestinian people, particularly in the Gaza Strip, facing retaliatory Israeli attacks;

5. Sanction Israel‚Äôs illegal occupation, apartheid and acts of aggression through the application of an arms embargo, economic sanctions and countermeasures against Israel.

instagram,"Conflicting protests erupted in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Sunday as Israeli and Palestinian supporters clashed following a peaceful start. Emotions flared on East Sunrise Boulevard as hundreds from both sides responded passionately to the recent Hamas attack, resulting in casualties on both sides. 

Pro-Israel and pro-Palestine demonstrators encountered each other, leading to heated confrontations before some protesters dispersed later in the evening. This protest reflects the ongoing tensions after a surprise multi-front attack by Hamas in Israel, with casualties reported. In South Florida, supporters from both sides are rallying, determined to continue until the conflict ends.

‚Å£
As someone who guides families through murder and loss, often caused by police or a government that refuses to provide justice, I understand murder and loss better than I wish I did. Me and @leemerrittesq can hardly sleep as a result of the work we‚Äôve done all our lives.‚Å£

But if 2023 is 9/11 for Israel, what do we call 2008 for Palestinians? ‚Å£
‚Å£
What about 2009?‚Å£
‚Å£
‚û°Ô∏è LOOK AT THE GRAPHIC. ‚Å£
‚Å£
In both of those years, far more Palestinians were killed by Israel than Israelis have been killed this week. ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚û°Ô∏èIf 2023 is 9/11 for Israel, WHAT DO WE CALL 2014, when Israel killed a STAGGERING 2,142 Palestinians? That‚Äôs comparable to 9/11. ‚Å£

‚Å£
1. This chart is from the @NYTimes. And the data is rock solid and widely accepted. ‚Å£

2. If you squint REALLY hard in most years you will see a little bit of purple there. That‚Äôs the amount of casualties Israel has suffered. ‚Å£

instagram,"For there ever to be peace, we in the US must fight to end our government‚Äôs military funding of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. This did not just become war, this has been war, and a resolution will only be achieved by addressing the root of the conflict: the occupation.

The killing of civilians‚Äì children, the elderly, the sick, the unarmed at large‚Äì is a horror. Loss of life is devastation, that is unequivocal. Please take a moment to pause and examine your heart if you say otherwise.
The violent occupation of a land and ongoing displacement of a people for decades is also a horror.
The right-wing US-funded Zionist war machine and the also right-wing Iran-backed Hamas can both be bad at the same time. In every case, it is a tragedy that the civilians of a country should have to suffer injury and death for the crimes of their governments.
It is no one‚Äôs choice where they are born and what circumstances they are born into.

There can be no mistaking these circumstances, though: the Palestinian people were forced out of their homes and off their land during the Nakba of 1948 and have endured continued displacement, eviction, surveillance, restriction of movement, and outright war in the intervening 75 years. So far this year, Israeli soldiers had already killed more than 250 Palestinians, including at least 47 children, in the occupied West Bank. Since 2005, the blockade against Gaza and its 2 million residents has created essentially the world‚Äôs largest open-air prison. This is all funded and facilitated by the US military-industrial complex.
You might say that violence is not ‚Äúthe answer‚Äù but neither is apartheid, neither is the jailing of a whole nation.
People cannot and will not live their lives in a cage.
‚ÄúThe answer‚Äù to the many, many atomized and collective problems we‚Äì all life on this earth‚Äì face will never be to sink more money into weapons of oppression, to put up more fences, or imprison more people.

During these tumultuous times, our hearts are with everyone affected by the ongoing conflict in Palestine and Israel, especially the Palestinian people who have endured decades of hardships.

As a proud American business, we believe in the core values of justice, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness for all. These principles guide our stance on domestic and international issues alike. We staunchly affirm that standing in solidarity with the oppressed and calling for an end to injustice anywhere in the world is a deeply American act, rooted in our nation's longstanding commitment to human rights and dignity. Independent groups like Amnesty International and the international community as a whole have long recognized that the Gaza Strip is the worlds largest open-air prison blockading basic needs for over 2 million Palestinians. During the latest conflict, the leaders of Israel publicly urged the people of Gaza to leave before their siege was set to begin - causing the world to question where the people should go.

It is with the core American spirit of standing with the oppressed we urge Israel, a significant power in the region, to act responsibly and with absolute compassion. Being a powerful nation comes with the irrefutable moral obligation to protect and uphold the rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or ethnicity. It is not too late to reverse the decades of wrongdoing that have been afflicted on the people of Palestine. It is not too late to grant Palestinians the basic human rights afforded to everyone in Israel.

instagram,"""The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Monday that it was deeply disturbed by reports that at least six journalists were among the civilians who were killed, injured or missing in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza.

On Saturday, two Palestinian journalists were shot dead while out reporting‚ÄîIbrahim Mohammad Lafi, a photographer for Ain Media, who was at the Gaza Strip‚Äôs Erez Crossing into Israel, and Mohammad Jarghoun, a reporter with Smart Media, who was to the east of Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian press freedom group MADA and the Journalist Support Committee (JSC), a nonprofit that promotes the rights of the media in the Middle East.

In addition, Ibrahim Qanan, a correspondent for Al-Ghad channel, was injured by shrapnel in the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, those sources said.

Two Palestinian photographers, Nidal Al-Wahidi from the Al-Najah channel and Haitham Abdelwahid from the Ain Media agency, have also been reported missing since Saturday.

On Saturday, CPJ reported that freelance journalist Mohammad El-Salhi was shot dead in the central Gaza Strip.

‚ÄúWe are extremely concerned that three Palestinian journalists have been killed, with two more declared missing, and another injured while reporting on the conflict between Israel and Gaza since it began on Saturday,‚Äù said Sherif Mansour, CPJ‚Äôs Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. ‚ÄúWe call on all sides to remember that journalists are civilians and should not be targeted.

instagram,"On September 20, the Indian government, in the context of the rising diplomatic tension with Canada, put out an advisory warning about ‚Äúgrowing anti-India activities and politically-condoned hate crimes‚Äù and the ‚Äúdeteriorating security environment in Canada‚Äù.

The advisory seemed to refer to a conflict-ridden and lawless country, and not to Canada, ranked the third safest country in the world. Soon, panic calls and messages came from families  and prospective immigrants to Canada.

A similar kind of advisory was issued a year ago, with similar kinds of responses. This had led a Hindu right-wing affiliated website then to declare that ‚ÄúCanada is officially unsafe for Indians in general and Hindus in particular‚Äù because of Khalistani attacks.

Now, even some Indo-Canadian politicians, like the Hindu MP from Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Liberal Party, Chanda Arya, raised this fear among Hindu-Canadians after a condemnable video from a Khalistani extremist was posted, asking them to go back to India.

He was scathing in the criticism of his own government for allowing the ‚Äúglorification of terrorism or a hate crime targeting a religious group ‚Ä¶ in the name of freedom of speech and expression.‚Äù

This is a narrative that is quite solidified in large sections of the Indian media/social media, which uncritically amplify government messages and propagate fake news or one-sided narratives. Therefore, people in India believe that there are marauding mobs of Khalistani extremists threatening the life and limb of Hindus and Indians in Canada.

instagram,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel?  Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately.  Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.  But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.  Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.  And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.  And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.  Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.  But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13)  The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7)  The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus.  The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets.  It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says.  Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God.  This is no time to follow popular opinions.  This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word.

instagram,"Please read the following update from Daniel Pierce about some of the ways we have been able to help in Israel right now:

Earlier today, Max Voloshin went out to purchase groceries for displaced families from southern communities in Israel. (Max is one of our employees and our building manager in Jerusalem.) We also donated groceries to an organization that distributes food to the IDF soldiers who are currently amassed on Israel‚Äôs borders in preparation for the conflict over the coming days and weeks. We have opened up our home, and the Glory of Zion Jerusalem Ministry Center to accommodate families from the south who need to take shelter outside of the Gaza area. We are so blessed to have the Ministry Center and home in Jerusalem to serve the community in this way.
 
When Max arrived to stock our home with groceries, the alarm sirens went off in Jerusalem. Max and his girlfriend took shelter in our safe room and counted ten explosions over the city. This was the second rocket attack on Jerusalem today.  Tel Aviv also had rockets this morning. 
 
Max also shared with us that the grocery stores are very crowded and food is going fast. The city is currently shut down other than the grocery stores and people have been instructed to shelter in place. Thank you for continuing to pray for Israel and support in every way we are called to through Glory of Zion International.",,1747,"{'like_count': 1698, 'comment_count': 49, 'num_users': 69177}",Chuck D Pierce,,2023-10-09 17:21:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/306514180_618498666621399_4622752215039873675_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=DHxT4jZXVOQAX-ZvX_m&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCNl4vn6Z-1xr4trkm7pqgMRK-tRMHEgZviAk4B33u5MQ&oe=6559FF20,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyL62e0uE1K/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387268904_215642914865749_1915777453810943015_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ss-WNLn1iRoAX-JRiEo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDULIEpZileAnhsSuF5PZBSajQ_NbrxJVaDqb_wN5CuSQ&oe=6558990C

always passes by gardens and windows
and children playing and a barking dog.

Remember the fruit that fell and remind it
of the leaves and the branch,
remind the hard thorns
that they were soft and green in springtime,
and don't forget that the fist, too,
was once the palm of an open hand, and fingers.

instagram,"Two Tanzanian students are reported missing in the ongoing Israel-Palestine war.

In the wake of the escalating Israel-Gaza conflict, the Tanzanian embassy in Israel has embarked on a frantic search for two Tanzanian students who have gone missing following a Hamas attack.

Tanzania's ambassador to Israel, Alex Kallua, told the BBC that his mission has been in contact with approximately 350 Tanzanians around the country, most of them students.

""We understand that there are two students missing in south Israel, where the situation is not OK. The two were on their internship pursuing agri-business studies,"" he said.

‚ÄúWe believe the two are fine and hope to get them safe. The embassy is also closely monitoring the situation to keep everyone safe,‚Äù he added.

There are around 350 Tanzanians living in Israel, including around 260 students pursuing agricultural programs, according to the embassy.

The Israel-Gaza conflict has elicited a global outcry, with countries worldwide expressing their concerns and calling for an immediate halt to the violence.

Thousands of lives have so far been lost, as no end is in sight for the war-torn region.

Just a few weeks ago senior intelligence officials were saying ‚ÄòHammas is not interested in widespread conflict',‚Äù says Peter Lerner, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Israeli Defence Forces, and former IDF spokesperson.

For a country that arguably has the most sophisticated human intelligence and electronic intelligence gathering networks in the region, Israel didn‚Äôt see Hamas‚Äôs assault coming.

‚ÄúThis is obviously a grave miscalculation on the part of the intelligence community,‚Äù says retired Lt Colonel Lerner.

instagram,"Today, we give flowers to @rigobertamenchu ‚Äî Mayan k‚Äôiche‚Äô human rights activist, feminist, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate

Born in 1959 in Chimel, a small Mayan community in Guatemala, Rigoberta traveled to communities teaching rural campesinos their rights. 

During ethnic and socioeconomic tensions and war, Rigoberta and her family mobilized Guatemalans to denounce government-led mass atrocities.

Rigoberta and her family‚Äôs activism led to their targeting as her father and other campesinos were murdered in a fire and her brother and mother were tortured years later. 

By the time, the peace agreement was signed, ending the 42-year-long conflict, 450 Mayan villages were destroyed, more than 200,000 Guatemalans were murdered and 1 million were displaced. 

Rigoberta fled to Mexico in 1981 and continued her work for the rights of indigenous peoples. 

In her book, ‚ÄúI, Rigoberta Mench√∫‚Äù she continued to share her story and later helped to define and distinguish the concept of ‚Äúindigenous peoples.‚Äù 

Later, in 1992, Rigoberta was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her ‚Äústruggle for social justice and ethno-cultural reconciliation based on respect for the rights of indigenous peoples.‚Äù

In 2006, Rigoberta and five other Nobel laureates established the Nobel Women's Initiative to promote peace, justice and equality for women.

Today, Rigoberta continues her work promoting the rights of indigenous people, women, equality, and peace.

‚úäüèΩThe Rigoberta Mench√∫ Tum Foundation (FRMT) plays a vital role in supporting Mayan governments and seeking justice through advocating in several high-profile cases. 

‚úäüèΩIn 2013, Rigoberta was appointed as a Special Investigator within the Autonomous National University of Mexico (UNAM) Multicultural Nation Program to investigate and seek justice for all Mayan people impacted by the genocide.

Today, we give Rigoberta flowers for her dedication to ensuring justice for indigenous peoples and her perseverance despite facing numerous systemic and oppressive obstacles.

It was my first time to Tel Aviv, and I enjoyed it very much as a city. I understand that the streets are currently very quiet with most people staying indoors. I am very sorry for everyone who has to live with conflict, regardless of where that may be in the world. I am not making any political statements here. I'm just pointing out that one the one hand, things can change so very quickly so we always have to appreciate what we have and second, I really do feel bad for all in the world who must suffer due to conflict. Wishing you all the best regardless of circumstance....

instagram,"The European Commission has decided to freeze all development aid payments to Palestinians, with a total value of 691 million euros ($728.66 million). This bold move comes in the wake of escalating violence and instability in the region.

Oliver Varhelyi, the EU Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, conveyed the gravity of the situation through a statement on the social media platform X. He emphasized, ""The scale of terror and brutality against Israel and its people is a turning point."" Varhelyi made it clear that the EU could not continue with ""business as usual"" in light of recent developments.

The immediate consequence of this decision is the suspension of aid payments. Additionally, ongoing projects are being put under review, and any new budget proposals have been postponed indefinitely. This marks a significant shift in the EU's approach to aiding Palestinians, reflecting the urgent need for a resolution to the escalating conflict.

instagram,"More than 1,100 people have been killed since conflict between Israelis and Palestinians erupted on Saturday morning.

The Israeli army said it hit more than 500 targets in the blockaded and impoverished Gaza Strip in overnight clashes, while fighting persisted in seven to eight locations inside Israel around the enclave.

It came two days after Hamas launched a barrage of rockets and sent a wave of fighters who gunned down civilians and took at least 100 hostages in an massive attack that took Israel by surprise.

Yesterday the Israeli government officially declared war on the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israel to prepare for a ""long and difficult"" conflict.

Israeli air strikes have hammered the impoverished and blockaded Gaza Strip, an enclave of 2.3 million people, with officials there reporting at least 413 Palestinian deaths.

instagram,"What began on Oct 7 as a ""surprise attack"" with Palestinian group Hamas launching multiple rockets into Southern Israel has become one of the biggest escalations in the Israel-Palestine conflict in recent times. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war against Hamas, saying, ""we are at war, and we will win"". Around 6 a.m. (IST) on Oct 9, the death toll passed 1,100, with thousands wounded on both sides, AP reported.

An adverse economic impact of the conflict is expected worldwide. India, too, is not excluded from the spillover effects.

IMPACT ON INDIA-ISRAEL BILATERAL TRADE
According to the Embassy of India in Israel, the trade (excluding defence) between the two countries stood at USD 10.1 billion in the financial year 2022-23. That fiscal, Indian merchandise exports to Israel were valued at $7.89 billion and Israeli exports to India were $2.13 billion.

India's major exports to Israel include automotive diesel, chemical and mineral products, machinery and electrical equipment, plastics, textile and apparel, transport equipment, and agricultural products. India primarily imports defence machinery, petroleum oils, electrical equipment and transport equipment.

The bilateral trade could take a hit if the Israel-Hamas war is prolonged, as Israel's resources would then get concentrated towards conflict response.

EFFECT ON OIL PRICES
Although Israel and Palestine are not major oil players, the violent conflict at the moment is happening in a broader key oil-producing region. Crude has already spiked as much as 5% intraday on fears that Israel-Hamas war may escalate even further.

US-brokered talks to normalize Saudi-Israel relations will likely be put on hold. This may delay oil production and reduce prices, a report by Mumbai-based risk consultancy firm Mitkat Advisory said.

But honestly‚Äî a trip to Italy is not our norm. What IS our norm is making time for each other every day, date nights at home when the kids go to bed, choosing a Netflix show we love and want to watch together, having our Sunday night check-ins each week, talking through the hard discussions, dealing with our conflict in healthy ways, setting boundaries around our lives and saying NO to a lot of extras so we can prioritize our marriage, and connecting emotionally & spiritually on a regular basis!! 

Having kids is a gift‚Äî but it comes with a lot of responsibility. One of the biggest responsibilities is showing them in real time what a healthy relationship looks like so they can model that in their own life.

Slide 1: The Greens reject and condemned all forms of violence, especially against civilians. There must be an immediate ceasefire between the State of Isreal and Hamas. 

Slide 2: The right to resist occupation must be in accordance with international law. The premeditated targeting of civilians by Hamas violates these laws. The bombing of Palestine civilians in response by the state of Isreal violates these laws.

At least seven Palestinians were killed in two Israeli air strikes on two houses in Gaza, according to medics. Israeli planes carried out dozens of air strikes, many in the northern town of Beit Hanoun.

Israeli air strikes on Sunday hit housing blocks, tunnels, a mosque and homes of Hamas officials in Gaza. The Palestinian health ministry said more than 400 people including scores of children had been killed.

‚ÄúThe price the Gaza Strip will pay will be a very heavy one that will change reality for generations,‚Äù said Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in the town of Ofakim, which suffered casualties and had hostages taken.

instagram,"President directs police to provide necessary security to Israelis in SL

While calling for assistance in facilitating the return of Israelis, including tourists and employees in Sri Lanka to Israel, President Ranil Wickremesinghe directed police to provide necessary security to the Israelis within Sri Lanka.

In a briefing to the Cabinet, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed deep concern over the recent attacks in Israel and its implications on Sri Lankans and Israelis residing in both countries, the President's Media Division (PMD) said.

President Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for immediate action to ensure the safety of Sri Lankans working in Israel. He directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to locate and ensure the well-being of these individuals. 

While reaffirming Sri Lanka's longstanding support for the two-state concept of Israel and Palestine, President Wickremesinghe condemned the recent Hamas attack on Israel, which resulted in the loss of numerous civilian lives. He stressed that despite past criticisms of Israel's actions, such attacks could not be justified.

President Wickremesinghe called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in line with the African Union proposal, emphasizing the broader consequences of the crisis on global fuel prices. 

He noted that the ongoing conflict would likely lead to a prolonged period of high fuel prices, adversely affecting developing economies, including Sri Lanka.

The President's statement underscores Sri Lanka's commitment to peace and stability in the region and its concern for the safety and well-being of its citizens and foreign residents amidst the current crisis.",,1404,"{'like_count': 1296, 'comment_count': 108, 'num_users': 107106}",Daily Mirror,,2023-10-09 12:54:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/351443367_656516956295062_4448180953466469174_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=W_Gho1GYGs8AX86zE-F&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCmdhjFBTReNwlDdvbDVw6O62soj7oi1YtjHh2PZU8cWw&oe=655B3EA1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLcUgGrQFM/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386907914_857754546012488_6838265259931113873_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9I5OmLpR9G8AX_sA9aX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDeGsn4VGBtDKIbmeMKtI0kZO5QlTpjIP9IsK0Ayx_zHw&oe=6530D681

My heart goes out to the people of Israel and the families of the victims. This never ending conflict has to stop. The people of the Middle East deserve competent leadership and an end to demagoguery and religious fanaticism. 
The commentary here has been disappointing, so let me be clear. Murder and kidnapping is wrong, no matter who commits it. I would be similarly outraged if Israel had swept in and slaughtered 600 Palestinian people. For what it‚Äôs worth, I think that Netanyahu is a malignant agent and has set the peace process back, not forward. 
But this? 
No one should be celebrating.

The Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political conflict beginning in the mid-20th century, and the world is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel.

When people discuss Israel and Palestine, it may be easy to think of hatred and conflict. Such a stereotype prompted the French artist JR to create the ""Face2Face"" project in 2007.

JR photographed the locals of the same profession in several cities in Israel and Palestine, including teachers, musicians, actors, hairdressers, and students. He captured their exaggerated expressions at close quarters and exhibited their large-scale images side by side in Jerusalem and Bethlehem.

What surprised JR was that even locals could not distinguish between Israeli and Palestine portraitures. When they looked at the so-called ""enemy"" images face to face, they did not feel hatred, threats, or insults, making people wonder where their hostility comes from.

instagram,"Israel pounded the Palestinian enclave of Gaza on Sunday, killing hundreds of people in retaliation for one of the bloodiest attacks in its history when Islamist group Hamas killed 700 Israelis and abducted dozens more.

Hamas fighters' rampage through Israeli towns on Saturday was the deadliest such incursion since Egypt and Syria's attacks in the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago and has threatened to ignite another conflagration in the long-running conflict.

In response, Israeli air strikes hit housing blocks, tunnels, a mosque and homes of Hamas officials in Gaza, killing more than 400 people, including 20 children, in keeping with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vow of ""mighty vengeance"".

Appeals for restraint came from around the world, though Western nations largely stood by Israel while Iran, Hezbollah and protesters in various Middle Eastern nations lauded Hamas.

instagram,"The gist of the situation in Israel:

‚óè Hamas attack occurred during a leave block for a holiday so security posture was relaxed leading to a complete blitzkrieg due to everyone on leave

‚óè Various bases and govt infrastructure overun 

‚óè ~3-4 hundred (couldve been more) Hamas fighters went to towns and began indiscriminately killing everyone they saw including going into homes and killing entire families reports of hamas fighters putting on IDF uniforms to trick people into opening their door has been reported too

‚óè Women especially prior military or active were kidnapped with reports of rape along with other citizens back into Gaza including a Israeli General that was captured and killed

‚óè Israeli government has declared full scale war unlike its previous strict ROEs on fighting within Gaza and will not consider negotiations and intend to fully wipe out Hamas in its entirety

‚óè Use of makeshift gliders to fly below radar were used to fly over walled off areas in Gaza and were used to land at a rave that was going on in Southern Israel where they then proceeded to massacre everyone at the concert 260+ dead from that alone

‚óè IDF soldiers that were cut off and killed have had their bodies dragged through streets and reports of beheadings are now coming out

‚óè 150k reservists recalled to active duty with combat operations intended to begin with an invasion of Gaza 

‚óè Air strikes have been rolling none stop while simultaneously rocket barges from Hamas have been non stop as well with an opening Salvo of 5000 rockets fired into Israel at the beginning of the attack

‚óè Videos of Israeli tanks captured and destroyed with dead crew being taken by fighters

‚óè ~6 hundred Israelis dead with death toll expected to rise  dozens being police and military along with massacred civilians 

‚óè Iran believed to have some role in the planning of this 

‚óè Intense fighting ongoing as IDF begins to retake lost towns and govt infrastructure 

‚óè US carrier group dispatched to Israel to deter other nations or proxies to join the conflict

Wild stuff happening. This is the worst couple days for Israel in its history happening right now.

instagram,"Defense mechanisms, we all use them. We all use many of them. They are a way to help us maintain our self image and to avoid our fears. Any type can use any defense mechanism but there is one that fits with your type rather well.
‚†Ä 
The defense mechanism that fits type 9 is Narcotization.
‚†Ä 
In order to avoid conflict and in order to keep their self image of being comfortable or harmonious, 9s will make use of narcotization.
‚†Ä 
Narcotization is numbing oneself to avoid feeling something that feels too difficult/uncomfortable/painful. Like all defense mechanisms, this is mostly done subconsciously.
‚†Ä 
Defense mechanisms protect our ego but keep us from being fully ourselves and developing deeper relationships.
‚†Ä 
Once you know what your defense mechanism is:
1) Notice WHEN you use it
2) Ask yourself WHAT is really going on
3) Ask WHY you are wanting to protect yourself
4) Ask do you NEED to use the defense mechanism
5) Be vulnerable and step out of your fear of losing your self image

 I‚Äôm Sitting Here Thinking of What‚Äôs Happening to The People of Palestine Right Now and What The Oppressors are doing to Them and Have been doing to Them for DECADES [Gaza is The Largest Open Air Prison in The World]. 

I Visited Palestine/Jerusalem in 2020 and Have a Strong Love for Them and Their Beautiful Hearts and onGoing Struggle [to be Oppressed How They Have Been, Yet be so Hospitable and Welcoming Was Something That Melted My Heart, Makes Me Think of Them Weekly‚Ä¶ I Have so Many Stories I Could Share‚Ä¶ go Look at My HighlightsüëÄ]. 

do Your Research on Where The ‚ÄúConflict‚Äù Stems from, Read The Belfour Declaration of 1917, How it Came About and What Came from it, See How Many Hundreds of Thousands of Palestinians Were Displaced Between 1947-1949 and What The Nakba is. 

Islam Teaches:

 ‚ÄúMessenger of Allah Ô∑∫ said: 'Indeed when people see an oppressor but do not prevent him from doing evil, it is likely that Allah will punish them all.‚Äù

""Oppression will be a darkness on the Day of Resurrection."" 

And think not that Allah is unaware of what the oppressors do. He only grants them respite until the day the eyes will stare in horror. - [QURAN, 14:42]

I Pray for All The Oppressed People Around The World and Their Victory Over Their Oppressors and  Supporters ü§≤üèæ Ameen !

instagram,"Is there really a mystery here? Like we don‚Äôt know why 2 Biden state department officials wrote statements condemning the attacks by Hamas, but also calling for a ceasefire? Who doesn‚Äôt want the bloodshed of over 1000 Israelis and Palestinians to end? To whom is a ceasefire dangerous? Weapons manufacturers that bought your government. 

THE NEW REPUBLIC: The Biden administration has sparked backlash for posting and then deleting tweets that called for a ceasefire between Israel and Palestine.

Fighting broke out on Saturday when Hamas launched a surprise airstrike attack on Israel, killing about 900 people. Israel has since responded in kind, imposing a total siege on the Gaza Strip, cutting off food, water, and electricity. More than 680 Palestinians have been killed in the counteroffensive‚Äîand the death toll on both sides is expected to quickly rise.

On Saturday, before the conflict really escalated, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to discuss a solution. Blinken then shared a statement on X, formerly Twitter, saying he ‚Äúencouraged Turkey‚Äôs advocacy for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages by Hamas immediately.‚Äù
He quickly deleted the post and replaced it with a statement that said only, ‚ÄúIsrael has the right to defend itself, rescue any hostages, and protect its citizens.‚Äù

Blinken‚Äôs fast 180 was the second time the State Department backtracked on a statement calling for Israeli restraint.

Hours after the initial attack, the State Department‚Äôs Office of Palestinian Affairs said on X that it ‚Äúunequivocally condemned the attack of Hamas terrorists and the loss of life that has incurred. We urge all sides to refrain from violence and retaliatory attacks. Terror and violence solve nothing.‚Äù

The office soon deleted the post and shared a statement saying only that it ‚Äúunequivocally‚Äù condemned the attack.

Hamas said Monday that it would be open to discussing a truce or ‚Äúsomething of that sort‚Äù with Israeli officials. The group said it had ‚Äúachieved its targets.‚Äù",,1118,"{'like_count': 973, 'comment_count': 145, 'num_users': 348352}",Lady Bunny,,2023-10-09 22:06:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/281355785_994796598065498_5845186840137323383_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=S8Xa0vHz8_EAX940GXP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAz7pxJ6R7nFKHo69sYIeW_fsFUISRBmyksX6h70mkZtg&oe=655A5733,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMbe9nuN65/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387268133_879386473773967_4431785956684828165_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=FAjJaOuA7WcAX8cp_i1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB6dH37vPAtL-eX2soxbih2k0ab_KWioT7ePe0qk8QC8A&oe=653043E0

Her Royal Highness saw the work of UNICEF in the region, in response to the devastating and far-reaching impact of conflict related sexual violence (CRSV), and gender-based violence.

The Duchess has championed the Prevention of Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI), and survivors of CRSV, for a number of years, and has travelled widely to bear witness to their testimonies.

The Duchess of Edinburgh visited Sabacare IDP Camp, which has a population of over 16,000 Internally Displaced Persons, the majority of whom are women and girls. Her Royal Highness spent time hearing about the ongoing challenges they face and the specialised help they receive from trained UNICEF supported workers before joining them for some skilled sewing activities.

instagram,"""The Palestinian people will continue to defend themselves, their homes, and their fundamental right to live in freedom and dignity, free from occupation, apartheid, and persecution,"" reads an extract from a statement issued by the embassy of the Palestine State in Tanzania.

The embassy has issued a statement condemning the ongoing conflict and calling upon the international community to act against the terror in Gaza.

In a statement issued today, October 9, 2023, the embassy urged that the international community act on their collective political, legal, humanitarian, and moral responsibilities to call out the ongoing war.

‚ÄúIt (the community) has a responsibility to promote accountability, which is the only viable remedy for this illegal, abhorrent situation,‚Äù the statement reads.

This statement came as the conflict between Palestine and Israel has lasted a third day, with over 510 people killed in Gaza and 800 more killed in Israel so far, according to international media outlet Al Jazeera.

The media live track shows that there are 2,750 people injured in Gaza and 2,243 injured in Israel.

The statement adds, ‚ÄúThe facts are not in dispute. Israel, as an occupying power, is fully responsible for this situation because it insists on keeping the Palestinian people captive and stripping them of their rights for over half a century.""

Tanzanian government had also commented on Sunday, October 8, 2023, through the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. January Makamba, who reiterated Tanzania's position for peaceful resolution.

instagram,"In a Third World War with nuclear weapons, Earth's future is grim. Humanity must find a solution, as the planet may become uninhabitable. We created these weapons, but alien intervention is unlikely.

Let's find the answers with the help of Neha, Jack, & Elena. This science fiction has a serious message for the world community.

It is a thought-provoking and timely science fiction novel that delves into the profound consequences of a hypothetical Third World War and the use of nuclear weapons. This gripping narrative follows the interconnected lives of Neha, Jack, & Elena as they navigate a world teetering on the brink of catastrophe.

The novel's premise explores a chilling scenario: global conflict leading to nuclear devastation & an uninhabitable Earth. It vividly depicts the catastrophic power of these weapons, forcing readers to confront this terrifying possibility.

One of the central themes of the novel revolves around the responsibility of humanity in creating weapons of mass destruction. The narrative questions the wisdom of crafting instruments that could lead to our own annihilation. This ethical dilemma is skillfully woven into the storyline, prompting readers to reflect on the choices made by society & its leaders.

The characters of Neha, Jack, & Elena are compelling and relatable, providing a human face to the dire circumstances they find themselves in. Their individual journeys & experiences serve as a microcosm of the larger global crisis, allowing readers to empathize with the personal toll of war & its consequences.

What sets this book apart is its intriguing suggestion that salvation may come from beyond our world. The prospect of aliens from a different planet intervening to save Earth adds an element of mystery and wonder to the narrative. This imaginative twist challenges conventional thinking and introduces a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak scenario.

In conclusion, it is a riveting science fiction novel that not only entertains but also serves as a cautionary tale for our world community. It prompts readers to contemplate the destructive potential of our own creations & the urgent need for global cooperation & peace.

There is nothing wrong with being kind to someone else, but it can also be something we do to avoid disappointing others or put pressure on ourselves to live up to an ideal image. A lot of us consciously choose to act this way because we are afraid of upsetting others. It is a great way to avoid conflict, but in the long run it will leave you feeling drained and unhappy.

Details:

From the sun-drenched streets of Riverside to the chilling, unfathomable void of space, unfolds a tale of love, lost memories, interdimensional war, and the relentless search for identity.

Ben Kensi, a top high school basketball player, is haunted by dreams of a green-eyed girl wielding PSI powers. When tragedy strikes heartbreakingly close, he's cast into a realm beyond our galaxy. He soon finds himself aboard the flagship of a beleaguered human civilization from another dimension‚Äîthe Alliance.

As he endures grueling training and stands on the precipice of war with the dreaded Acheron, pieces of Ben's obscured past collide with his reality. The mysterious green-eyed girl transitions from a figure in his dreams to a tangible link to a history rife with love, betrayal, and powerful PSI abilities.

Yet, with Earth's very survival at stake, revelations arise that shake the core of Ben's identity. Is he truly the savior foreseen to prevent interdimensional war, or is he just a pawn in a grander scheme? As destiny's crossroads near, Ben is forced to face the ghosts of his tormented past and determine his role in the looming cosmic conflict.

In ""Worldcatcher"", alliances waver, hidden truths surface, and the very fabric of reality becomes questionable. Dive into an epic interstellar journey where nothing is as it seems.",,943,"{'like_count': 943, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 49572}",Modern Library,,2023-10-09 16:03:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/316174702_1377681206305488_5832098434312968155_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=riJfKo7K2egAX_fC51s&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAvR9ycIAsDn6Q_OsjpjzpXlBmp7TNfR7p-3oLtmpCM4Q&oe=655A7547,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLx-mRPB5o/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387661973_739274118008186_2259753752598843511_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Te66Hy5biDgAX_il6Em&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAF6g4hOTGhId5xs9yE5YjEvuIzJVhwP4HvubgOaRR3Uw&oe=65454101

instagram,"Back in 2018, I went to Israel with @realityisrael with 50 other storytellers all with the purpose to show us firsthand ALL of the sides of the story of the Israel conflict and its deep complexity. We met Palestinian families and Israelis of all walks of life, holocaust survivors, and members of the military and media. We saw where Jesus was crucified and learned how 3 main religions of the world were all born out of the same tiny stretch of land. It was such an intensely emotional and powerful trip that I left with many more questions than when I arrived.¬†

This current violence and war is not about which side you are on Israeli or Palestinian... It is about terrorism and the evil that has brewed inside of Gaza with Hamas.¬†

This terrorist group has preyed on the intense poverty of Gaza and many innocent families that live there with little help or hope from the rest of the world. They have been trapped in this no man's land that has been run mostly unchecked by terrorists and now there will be many casualties not only Israelis, but innocent Palestinians

I feel such deep sadness and frustration as I watch young people getting dragged from an outdoor music festival in Israel  to being kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed by Hamas terrorists. And now the Israeli prime Minister wants to show no mercy to Gaza for these attacks and more innocent people will be collateral damage. This is the single greatest massacre of Jewish people since the holocaust.¬†

Hamas is not Palestine or Iran, although they have many supporters with them. They are horrible, hateful terrorists who get up everyday with the sole purpose of finding new ways to terrorize and kill people.
Everyone on all sides will suffer from these attacks. No one wins here no matter what the outcome is. 

My experience with the people of Israel is that they are all about progress and building a better world. It is disgusting to me that there are people celebrating the senseless murders of young, innocent people. and dragging their bloody bodies through the street. When did we lose humanity? When did people become animals? It is so sickening to me.

instagram,"The IMF and World Bank gather in Morocco Monday for their first annual meetings on African soil in 50 years, under pressure to reform to better aid poor nations blighted by debt and climate change.

The International Monetary Fund and World Bank traditionally hold their annual gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors outside their Washington headquarters every three years.

The southern Moroccan city of Marrakesh was supposed to host it in 2021, but the gathering was postponed twice because of the Covid pandemic.

A powerful earthquake that killed nearly 3,000 people in the region south of Marrakesh last month threatened to derail the event again, but the government decided it could go ahead.

The IMF and World Bank last held their meetings in Africa in 1973, when Kenya hosted the event and some nations were still under colonial rule.

Half a century later, the continent faces an array of challenges ranging from conflict to a series of military coups to unrelenting poverty to natural disasters.

-Maggi Hambling
 
Join us at Flowers, 21 Cork Street, London W1 during Frieze Week 10th-14th October for LOST GIRLS.

Thirty years on from our original collaboration with the charity War Child, we are delighted to host this fundraising exhibition, powerfully curated by the InFems Art Collective, with works donated by artists including Maggi Hambling, Ai Wei Wei, Caroline Coon, Nadia Duvall, Tewodros Hagos, Pam Hogg, Peter Howson, Linder, Tracey Moffatt, Penny Slinger and many more.  While boldly addressing the challenges faced by girls affected by war and coinciding with the UN's International Day of the Girl Child, LOST GIRLS aims to raise vital funds for War Child‚Äôs work.
 
This stunning painting by Hambling is one of the many pieces with all proceeds generously benefitting War Child, who are driven by a single goal ‚Äì ensuring a safe future for every child affected by war. It works in some of the hardest to reach places to support those who are hardest hit, aiming to reach children as quickly as possible when conflict breaks out and stay long after the cameras have gone to support them through their recovery.
 
Maggi Hambling‚Äôs ‚ÄòVictim XXXIX‚Äò is one of a series of portraits of unnamed casualties of war and war-torn landscapes. 

Learn more about it and purchase on Artsy via the link in our bio, view it and more in LOST GIRLS at 21 Cork Street during Frieze week 10th ‚Äì 14th October, 11am-6pm.

instagram,"#NSTnation Former Prime Minister Tun Dr #MahathirMohamad has denounced the Western world's hypocritical and biased response to the crisis between #Palestine and #Israel.

In a post on X, Dr Mahathir criticised powerful Western nations and their media, labelling them hypocritical towards the reactions to the recent hostilities.

""Instead of addressing the conflict for what it actually is, they chose to continue with their deceptive narrative that it is an attack on Israel by terrorists with their blame being obviously against #Hamas, #Hezbollah and #Iran.

""With that narrative, they stoked fear in the Western community, claiming that it is an attack on democracy and peace loving people and that the United States in particular felt justified to extend military support to Israel to retaliate against #Palestinians attacks.""

instagram,"End the violence.

We grieve the lives of those already lost and remain committed to a future where every life is precious, and all people lives in peace, freedom and safety.

According to media reports, both Palestine and Israel sides are seeing increasing numbers of death and injuries, with at least 20,000 internally displaced people are taking refuge in 44 schools, including 28 designated emergency shelters, in all areas in the Gaza Strip.

In complex emergencies and crisis like this, inevitably, oppressed people everywhere will seek protection and humanitarian assistance. Everyone deserve liberation, safety and equality, and the only way to get there is by uprooting the source of violence of the conflict.

These unprecedented hostilities and rapidly mounting death toll underscore the urgency for all parties to stop the violence and ensure civilians are protected. All parties must adhere to international humanitarian law by refraining from deliberately or indiscriminately targeting civilians from both sides.

MERCY Malaysia is deploying its first mission members on 9 October 2023, and is fully prepared to provide essential humanitarian assistance and collaborate closely with partners to respond effectively to the escalating humanitarian crisis unfolding in Palestine. 

MERCY Malaysia is monitoring the humanitarian impact and looking at all possibilities to provide aid to support those in need of humanitarian assistance.

Oil prices are gaining ground again as markets continue to react to the sudden and astonishing outbreak of violence set in motion by Hamas this weekend. The uncertainty in our world economy just got amplified 100-fold. 

WHAT HAPPENED
Hamas launched a massive surprise attack against Israel this past Saturday morning. The attack involved overwhelming Israeli missile defense systems with swarms of small rockets, paraglider invasions, and targeted kidnapping of Israeli citizens. The attacks were broad and hit everything from military to civilian targets. The death toll from this attack is already over 1,000 people and Israel has declared a state of war against Hamas. As of early this morning, Israel has managed to re-secure towns that border the Gaza Strip as they prepare to defend against further incursions by Hamas. Further, Israel has initiated targeted bombardments into the Gaza Strip and is calling for a full siege of the region.",,800,"{'like_count': 733, 'comment_count': 67, 'num_users': 193537}",Moby,,2023-10-09 20:25:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/275115193_930394291008775_79785725939583672_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=mEUfKA_oMQgAX93SKOa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAVhSWHBQMcEfG1tiMnpS4SJ9B8iOTZN-gdl1aoovkCnQ&oe=6559C53E,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMP5vxAFJT/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387267584_858357465877169_4661180891347277415_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=eOtGc-B6ossAX-UhWQx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCqmHSGBXlUstfXNCmfxzDBxxYnUHdrEkLm5xT47t2q6w&oe=6557FAC8

instagram,"The manner in which a couple divides labor is often a major source of unhappiness in today‚Äôs marriage, which could translate to a higher risk of divorce. According to studies, women fundamentally take on a whole ‚Äúsecond shift‚Äù of work when they get home from their outside jobs. This can take a toll on the marriage. 

A recent Harvard interview with Eve Rodsky suggests that even when couples do divide more obvious household responsibilities like cooking and cleaning, women still do the primary heavy lifting for the ‚Äúemotional work‚Äù of tending to the home and children. 

When one spouse continues to take on a disproportionate share of the household responsibilities, it often results in the following:

- The affected spouse feels resentful and taken advantage of
- They feel more marital dissatisfaction
- They feel overburdened and depressed
- Risk of divorce increases

So... What is a fair division of labor? What isn‚Äôt fair?

To determine this, you might need to take a hard look at each person‚Äôs beliefs about gender roles. When spouses have differing beliefs about gender roles and household responsibilities, it can result in confusion and conflict. 

Many individuals grew up in households where the division of labor was gender-defined, fair or not. And although a person might intellectually understand the unfairness of this, they might also unwittingly slip into the well-worn grooves of the household they grew up in.

When spouses have differing ‚Äúgrooves‚Äù and beliefs about these roles, it can have a profound effect on the quality of their marriage. In fact, even when spouses do agree about what is and isn‚Äôt fair, an open and honest conversation is warranted.

instagram,"Life is hard. 
There's war in far away lands. 
There's war in homelands. 
There's war in people's hearts. 
There's war in people's minds and bodies. 
There's accidents and suffering and seemingly no hope. 

But there is hope.
There is peace.
The scripture says it's not peace that the world can give,  but something better. 

The world's peace would be ease and freedom from any conflict. 
But Christ's peace is stronger,  better. 

Rather than taking us out of the conflict, He brings Himself into it.  He doesn't remove the hard, He increases our capability, our strength, our peace in the hard. 

Why!? Why would He not just save us from all the hurt!? That's a really great question that I don't know the answer to. 

But I believe, I hope, that that's not the point of this life.  It's not to just skate through life on cloud 9. It's to learn how to really love other people and to love and choose God. 

So maybe you're like me,  and you have a list of people who are really struggling,  and you hear other people's stories, and it's all too much.

If all you are feeling is darkness right now,  look for the light. There is light everywhere.  Turn to Christ,  He will gladly bring the light to your darkness. 

Christ is my light, my peace, my strength, and my Savior. 

And if Christ doesn't resegnate with you, look inward,  find your own light,  because you have in it you.  And then share it, WE can be the ones to bring light to the dark, to the overwhelm, and to the hopeless.",,789,"{'like_count': 750, 'comment_count': 39, 'num_users': 262218}",Cassanda Morrise,,2023-10-09 03:47:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/252509032_409620597369470_5184168700557954426_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=HXT94QkUCeQAX-HtCVz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB6jnUhFFHo_WjIM3exuF_U0B7dehisXEgtE2JKjAozEw&oe=655AB195,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyKdt2yMVAh/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386887363_841782377324278_1313648777006216798_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JExBns1rG2kAX-FeG8o&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAgNVqDcvUfdZDAByatO9ll2FUZIk8zWmvjSrohHT2iYg&oe=654819D8

instagram,"We stand in solidarity with all those affected by the ongoing conflict, including our Israeli, Jewish, Palestinian friends, and individuals globally who bear the heavy burden of violence and insecurity. Our hearts particularly ache for children, women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, individuals with disabilities and other minorities, who face compounded violence and hardships.‚Å†
‚Å†
Our feminist approach underscores the urgency of prioritising human rights, safety and dignity of life for everyone, regardless of their gender, nationality, ethnic or religious background, etc.‚Å†
‚Å†
Taking a human rights perspective means unequivocally denouncing all forms of violence against civilians, recognising that no act of violence can ever legitimize another. It means demanding that every individual has the right to live freely and securely, free from the threat of violence or occupation. We firmly believe that advocating for these rights for all people simultaneously is not just possible but essential.‚Å†
‚Å†
Empathy is not a finite resource. Expressing compassion and solidarity for one group does not diminish our capacity to do the same for others. It is our duty to ensure that any content we share or comments we make promote empathy and understanding, shifting the focus toward human rights and away from hate.‚Å†
‚Å†
We reaffirm our commitment to the principle that no act of violence, use of military force against civilians can ever be justified. Our hearts go out to those enduring this harrowing experience, those kidnapped and separated from their loved ones, and those living in constant fear, not knowing when the next missile will strike.‚Å†
‚Å†
We urge you to reach out to your Israeli, Jewish, Palestinian friends. Let them know that you stand with them, also - and maybe especially - here in Germany, where they might be safer but not necessarily safe.‚Å†

instagram,"I am in full support of the Palestinian people who are forced to be a homeless nation by being  denied of their sovereign right. Because I am totally against hurting innocent people, I can never be happy when Israelis kill Palestinians or Palestinians kill Israelis. I can only hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. I might  be moderate in my opinion because I am against war in general, but that does not mean that I justify the injustice being done to the Palestinian people by their powerful neighbor Israel. Any human being who is against injustice cannot support the oppression of the Palestinian people. I even quoted Haile Selassie speech at the UN in order to explain that Palestinian are victims of racism and human rights violations  and  until the world does something about it, the conflict will not be resolved. I even gave the disproportionate numbers of killings on both sides to show that one side is killing more than the other, but I am not justifying the killing of innocents  on both sides. I call for the world to force a peaceful solution which is to allow Palestinian to have their own state and not be a homeless nation anymore but instead, enjoy full sovereignty. 
I am convinced that war and use of force no matter how powerful a nation is, is not the solution. It has to be a negotiated solution otherwise either the Palestinians have to kill all the Israelis or force them out of the land, or the Jews have to genocide all the Palestinians and take all of their land. There will be peace only if both sides compromise and accept that each of both nations have their own sovereign and independent state.

Yoav Gallant said on camera that Israel would halt the supply of electricity, food, water and fuel to the Palestinian enclave. ‚ÄúI have given an order ‚Äì Gaza will be under complete siege,‚Äù the minister said. ‚ÄúWe are fighting barbarians and will respond accordingly.‚Äù

Israeli forces are now conducting ‚Äúwide-scale strikes‚Äù on several ‚Äústrategic‚Äù centers in Gaza belonging to Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement Monday.

Earlier, Israeli forces fought door-to-door to regain control of all communities around Gaza. There is no ongoing fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants inside Israel, the Israeli military said. More than 48 hours have passed since the Islamist militant group launched a surprise assault, launching thousands of rockets and sending armed fighters into Israel.

instagram,"There were dozens of sovereign indigenous nations that once called the region in and around Charleston, home. When English colonists came to this land, it was chiefly occupied by the Kiawah. The Sewee, Yemassee, Kusso, and Edisto people were among others in the area, but it was mainly the Kiawah who were driven from their homes and confined on a reservation of sorts; a location today still named Kiawah Island. Throughout the history of interaction between southeastern Native nations and British colonists, there has been both cooperation and conflict. Historic Charleston Foundation acknowledges the original people who called this land home, and we honor their descendants who are still here. Happy Indigenous Peoples' Day!

instagram,"Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, is a prominent Palestinian militant group based in the Gaza Strip, a densely populated enclave housing over 2.1 million people. Founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian intifada, Hamas emerged as a defiant adversary of Israel. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian cleric, was its founding figure, and it established its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, around 1991. One distinguishing aspect of Hamas is its refusal to acknowledge the existence of Israel and its unwavering commitment to replacing Israel through armed struggle. The group seeks to establish a Palestinian state that spans from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. Given this stance, the United States designated Hamas as a terrorist organization in October 1997. Over the years, Hamas has employed various tactics, including the use of explosives, rockets, suicide bombings, and kidnappings, to target Israel. It has also received support from Iran, which has contributed to its military capabilities. Hamas's political influence has grown significantly in the Palestinian territories. It achieved a notable victory in the 2006 legislative elections in Gaza, defeating Fatah, the primary Palestinian political party that controls the West Bank. Israel has responded to Hamas's actions with military operations and a blockade that restricts imports and the movement of civilians, a strategy often described as collective punishment. This blockade and repeated Israeli strikes have had severe humanitarian consequences for Gaza, contributing to poor living conditions and infrastructure. Hamas's role in the recent conflict, involving a surprise attack and hostage-taking, has once again highlighted its significance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its determination to challenge the status quo. #israelpalestineconflict #israelpalestine #surpriseattack #talkdiplomacy #upsc #css #palestinianterritories #meditteraneansea #jordanriver #gazastrip #izzedinealqassambrigade #upscmotivation #upscaspirants #middleeasthistory #arabnationalism #palestinianintifada #muslimbrotherhood #palestinian #israeli #warhistory #wars",,718,"{'like_count': 700, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 91579}",TalkDiplomacy IR,,2023-10-09 22:28:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/328799506_219447953811073_3104956161528819700_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pw2J3khjfvsAX8PWC77&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDB5PH0Ztb9ehsOpSDE9OQh8wdqO0qrpdwjjvpSRE76eQ&oe=655AEA98,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMeE_MvN5j/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387747781_301819595927285_3446919722140060720_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=zMt4Se0m3JoAX_qRMTh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAXVGqDO0FrwOXoevtDPJ3ilFDs_luKWoiGjI2LNFYidg&oe=6537D859

instagram,"Sometimes running has to take a backseat, and I‚Äôm actually quite comfortable with this. 
You may have noticed, I haven‚Äôt had much to say about my running as of late. For various reasons, it has had to be put on the back burner. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve missed it, it‚Äôs a big part of my life and my health, both mentally and physically but with work being, to put it politely, hectic, and other areas of my life mounting up I‚Äôve had to prioritise. I am slowly building back up and feeling a little more hopeful that my health is on the up.
I‚Äôm also aware that sometimes you need to stop, take stock, in order  to actually move forward. It‚Äôs something I discuss with many clients.

True strength occurs when you know you have to deal with the potential inner critic for not being able to do what you feel like you should be able to do.
Too many people will put themselves in a position which is actually detrimental to their health- pushing their bodies, exercising when they are in pain, or not fuelling appropriately rather than deal with the potential voice and feelings that come after, when you actually take the time to do what your body needs in that moment. Call it FOMO, some people will call it resilience but true resilience is when you face up to your fears and sit with the difficult feelings and narrative that somehow you are falling short. 
Clients I work with talk about ‚Äúthe guilt‚Äù they know they will feel if they don‚Äôt complete the distance or if they eat the so-called ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù food. 
But is it guilt? Or is it fear of having to deal with ‚Äúthat voice?‚Äù
In all honesty,  if you  keep running those ultras, is that strength or just avoidance? 
True progress and recovery comes from taking responsibility. Accepting that inner conflict, turning up for yourself with compassion not judgement. 

Always remember that thoughts are not facts. They may be real, but you have the power over them. You don‚Äôt need to believe them. Instead ask yourself what is the evidence that these beliefs are true?

instagram,"Oil prices rallied while the dollar and yen advanced Monday after Hamas launched a shock attack on Israel at the weekend, sparking fresh concerns about tensions in the Middle East.

The crisis fanned concerns about supplies of crude from the region at a time when supply worries are already high owing to Saudi Arabia and Russia‚Äôs output cuts.

It has also renewed fears about the impact on inflation, with energy costs a key driver of spiking prices, giving a fresh headache to central banks as they try to ease up on interest rate hikes to avoid recessions.

The surprise attack and Israel‚Äôs declaration of war in response to it have left more than 1,000 dead and raised concerns that a potential broadening of the conflict could draw in the United States and Iran.

‚ÄúKey for markets is whether the conflict remains contained or spreads to involve other regions, particularly Saudi Arabia,‚Äù said ANZ Group‚Äôs Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes.

‚ÄúInitially at least, it seems markets will assume the situation will remain limited in scope, duration, and oil-price consequences. But higher volatility can be expected.‚Äù

Both main contracts surged more than five percent in early Asian business before easing back as the day wore on.

However, SPI Asset Management‚Äôs Stephen Innes warned: ‚ÄúHistorical analysis suggests that oil prices tend to experience sustained gains after the Middle East crises.

‚ÄúMeanwhile, stocks tend to eventually recover and trend higher after an initial period of volatility. Safe-haven assets like gold and Treasurys, which initially see gains during such crises, tend to fade from their initial price spikes as the situation stabilises.

‚ÄúBut with Middle East analysts considering this to be a pivotal moment for Israel, the view looks incendiary in any current scenario.‚Äù

A decidedly risk-off mood also saw investors push into the safety of the dollar, which was up against the pound and euro, as well as the Australian and New Zealand dollars.

The yen, considered one of the safest currencies, strengthened against the greenback, though it still remains locked around 11-month lows.

Gold, another key haven, gained around one percent.",,696,"{'like_count': 666, 'comment_count': 30, 'num_users': 1567395}",Channels Television,,2023-10-09 08:51:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/298706230_192763719847912_3087175657260310094_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=WzR-dGUzW88AX_YZebt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCQs8qFoW05WBU3tfNhaast9yEmQsxJPs7YeaZGTirbFw&oe=655AF17F,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLAjEdqKzk/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/387766863_962104511943967_2403078992957563051_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=z0BYAV0Or98AX8XNZ9x&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCK4ohHx_I-Tm3-tKGzfv_JLqWLqnUMR9BwC3mntWoUXQ&oe=652D210C
instagram,"Israel relentlessly pounded the Gaza Strip early Monday as fighting raged with Hamas around the Gaza Strip and the death toll from the war against the Palestinian militants surged above 1,100.

The Israeli army said it hit more than 500 targets in the blockaded and impoverished Gaza Strip in overnight clashes, while fighting persisted in seven to eight locations inside Israel around the enclave.

It came two days after Hamas launched a barrage of rockets and sent a wave of fighters who gunned down civilians and took at least 100 hostages in a massive attack that took Israel by surprise.

Sunday, the government officially declared war on the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israel to prepare for a ‚Äúlong and difficult‚Äù conflict.

More than 700 Israelis have been killed since Hamas launched its large-scale attack, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Monday. Another 1,200 people have been wounded, many critically.

In retaliation, Israeli air strikes have hammered the impoverished and blockaded Gaza Strip, an enclave of 2.3 million people, with officials there reporting at least 413 Palestinian deaths.

‚ÄúOvernight IDF fighter jets, helicopters, aircraft and artillery struck over 500 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip,‚Äù the military said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still fighting. There are between seven to eight open places around Gaza (where) we have still warriors fighting terrorists,‚Äù military spokesman Richard Hecht told reporters.

‚ÄúWe thought by yesterday (Sunday) we would have full control. I hope we will by the end of the day,‚Äù he added.

Thick plumes of smoke billowed from the Palestinian enclave as the strikes continued in the early hours of the morning, an AFP correspondent reported.

Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus estimated around 1,000 Palestinian militants had participated in Hamas‚Äôs assault on Saturday, which he called ‚Äúby far the worst day in Israeli history‚Äù.

‚ÄúNever before have so many Israelis been killed by one single thing, let alone enemy activity in one day,‚Äù he said.

He likened it to ‚Äúa 9/11 and a Pearl Harbour wrapped into one‚Äù.",,681,"{'like_count': 649, 'comment_count': 32, 'num_users': 1567395}",Channels Television,,2023-10-09 09:01:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/298706230_192763719847912_3087175657260310094_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=WzR-dGUzW88AX_YZebt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCQs8qFoW05WBU3tfNhaast9yEmQsxJPs7YeaZGTirbFw&oe=655AF17F,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLBuOuqqXg/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/387752006_962107731943645_5689966648280997136_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AFjX2n709icAX_bYS3c&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBjhNxonMCZ8YL-FzER1epKCek9DMbVdDXl03Kd66GSIQ&oe=652CCB96

instagram,"NEWS | On Sunday, Israel‚Äôs government declared war on Hamas, a Palestinian fundamentalist group that rules the Gaza Strip, after Hamas militants launched the most devastating attack on Israel in 50 years.

Within 36 hours of the assault and the first wave of the Israeli counterattack that followed, at least 1,450 people have been killed ‚Äî at least 800 in Israel and at least 687 in Gaza ‚Äî with thousands more still missing. 

In response to the attacks on Israel and the following counterattacks on Gaza, demonstrators convened in rallies and protests in downtown D.C. on Sunday to stand with their respective communities and voice their feelings on the violence that continues to unfold. 

The groups shared sentiments that likely encapsulate only a portion of the breadth of Israeli and Palestinian emotions about the attacks. But the demonstrations ‚Äî and the students who led them ‚Äî represent splintered factions as the federal government clambers to respond to the conflict.‚Ä®
Attendees at the first rally, including children and senior citizens, wrapped the Palestinian flag around their waist while others held signs reading ‚ÄúPalestine will be free‚Äù and ‚ÄúResistance is Justified.‚Äù Many wore keffiyehs, a traditional Arab headdress, while chanting and delivering speeches.‚Ä®‚Ä®About a mile away on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, more than 75 demonstrators, including Jewish student groups from GW, Georgetown and American universities, gathered solemnly to honor the lives of loved ones lost in the attack and amplify the voices of Israelis overseas

Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin tweeted Sunday he had received reports from the Thai ambassador in Tel Aviv ""that two Thai people had died from the violence."" A Cambodian national was also reported dead in Israel. Ten citizens of Nepal were among those killed in the Hamas assault on Israel, the Himalayan republic's embassy in Tel Aviv said in a statement Sunday, without giving more details.

The broad rage of nationalities caught up in this attack will likely lead to a much higher level of support for Israel's retaliation which is almost certainly going to be extensive. While there have been reports of numerous pro-Palestine protests around the globe, several counter-protests have resulted in violent confrontations. It is almost certain that this renewed conflict will last for some time, and will cost many lives.

instagram,"Foreign nationals are among those killed or kidnapped as fresh conflict broke out between Hamas and Israel over the weekend. The German Foreign Ministry said German nationals are among those abducted by Hamas, all of them dual Israeli-German citizens. On Saturday, German national Shani Louk was seen in the car of  Hamas militants in videos shared on social media. She had been attending a peace festival near Gaza. US media reports suggest several Americans were among the dead and US nationals among those abducted by Hamas. France said one of its nationals was killed in Israel, while several others were missing. Britain said one of its nationals, serving in the Israeli army, was killed on the Gaza border on Saturday. A second UK national is reported to be missing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday two of his country's nationals had died in the attacks. Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin tweeted Sunday he had received reports from the Thai ambassador in Tel Aviv ""that two Thai people had died from the violence."" A Cambodian national was also reported dead in Israel. Ten citizens of Nepal were among those killed in the Hamas assault on Israel, the Himalayan republic's embassy in Tel Aviv said in a statement Sunday, without giving more details. Nepal had earlier said at least 11 Nepali agricultural students were missing. They were studying near the Gaza border. Four others were injured in the attacks.

Israel has launched a large-scale attack against #Hamas, the Palestinian group running the #Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years.

The strip has a population of about 2.3 million people living in one of the most densely populated areas in the world.

After Hamas's attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to turn Gaza into a
""deserted island"" and warned its residents to ""leave now""

Hamas's surprise attack came after Israeli settlers stormed the Al-Aqsa #Mosque compound in recent days and a record number of Palestinians were killed by Israel in recent months.

instagram,"Speaking on Sunday on MSNBC's ""Weekends with Alex Witt,"" the four-star US Army general described how such an escalation likely would only occur if Israel's Middle Eastern neighbors became heavily involved.

""The other shoe we're waiting to see if it drops is, will Hezbollah intervene out of Lebanon with their 100,000 some odd rockets? Will the West Bank ignite? And what will the Syrians and the Egyptians do?"" McCaffrey said.

""I would suggest to you our support of Israel will be absolute, and if we see Syrian military intervention, active Iranian military intervention, we'll go to war,"" McCaffrey added.

Hamas militants launched a series of surprise attacks and rocket barrages against Israel on Saturday, killing hundreds and capturing dozens of hostages along the border of the Gaza Strip. Israel has declared war in response.

The Israel Defense Forces say 700 Israelis have been confirmed dead, while another 1,500 were wounded. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 400 Palestinians have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes, Reuters reported.

The US announced on Sunday that it is sending an aircraft carrier strike group, including F-35s and F-16s, to patrol the Eastern Mediterranean and deter all-out war involving Israel's neighbors.

""They're there for more than a show of force or a potential noncombatant evacuation,"" McCaffrey, who served in the Gulf War and led the US Southern Command from 1994 to 1996, told MSNBC.

McCaffrey noted that this was his own assessment of the conflict and that there ""is absolutely no way"" that any US official would concur publicly that America could go to war in Israel.

""What I am saying is that if the existence of the State of Israel is at stake, if the Syrian military intervene, if Hezbollah started overwhelming the Israelis, in my judgment, at that point, we would consider actively intervening with air power and naval power,"" he said.

However, it's unlikely that the US would send troops into Israel, given the Israel Defense Forces' own ground capabilities, McCaffrey added.",,620,"{'like_count': 572, 'comment_count': 48, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-09 08:34:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyK-iHWOc5X/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387693451_312824351355871_7341103678134859676_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=t8PapwK6EwsAX9Uit3u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBv5GmHdmArMu32dqZl4lOvEkoLRU8jIvcYwldnP-xtdQ&oe=652A561F

instagram,"Wow. That is the word I uttered out loud immediately upon finishing the total masterpiece that is Monica. Actually it was more like wow, wow, wow, wowwwwwww. In Clowe's own words, Monica is the story of a woman's life, from cradle to grave. But it's so much more than that. I was lucky enough to catch his talk @cartooncrossroads earlier this month, a deeply enriching and inspiring experience. One thing that really stuck out to me was his discussion of memory. He described a sensation of having memories of memories, that at this stage of his life, they have become distorted further and further over time. He also mentioned that after his mother passed, he really didn't have much family left, so all of these memories exist only in his own mind, no longer having anyone to corroborate any of these experiences from early life. There are so many vastly different entry points for me in this spectacular tome. Feelings of loss, loneliness, deep introspection into one's own life, being an outsider, loving your family members while simultaneously enduring the heavy weight of shared conflict and difficult emotions. Much like Patience, Monica's color palette is utterly beautiful. I lived with my grandparents growing up and they never updated their house. The kitchen was acid yellow, the tv room was brown and orange and my bedroom had dazzling pop flower wallpaper in stunning dayglo pinks, yellows, greens and blues. That vintage 1960s palette is forever burned in my heart and dna. Clowe's particular use of color tugs at my own distorted memory and comforts me deeply. Seven years in the making, you can feel every line, panel, word and color choice have been deeply considered.

instagram,"The Treaty of Bucharest, signed on August 10, 1913, was a pivotal agreement that marked the conclusion of the Second Balkan War and the redistribution of territories in the Balkan Peninsula. This treaty had far-reaching implications for the region's political landscape, leading to significant changes in borders and national sovereignty. The primary outcome of the Treaty of Bucharest was the territorial realignment among the Balkan states. Bulgaria, which had initiated the Second Balkan War in pursuit of greater territorial gains, suffered substantial losses. It ceded most of its acquired territories to neighboring states. Serbia, Greece, and Romania were among the primary beneficiaries, each expanding their respective borders at Bulgaria's expense. Key provisions of the treaty included the awarding of additional territory to Greece, including southern Macedonia and the island of Crete, and the expansion of Serbian and Romanian territories in the north. Serbia gained the Kosovo region and extended into northern and central Macedonia. Albania was made an independent state under a German prince. Bulgaria, on the other hand, was left with a significantly reduced territory.
The Treaty of Bucharest not only reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the Balkans but also sowed the seeds for future conflicts and rivalries in the region. Bulgaria's sense of grievance over territorial losses would contribute to its alignment with the Central Powers during World War I. The treaty illustrated the challenges of post-conflict negotiations and the complexities of addressing competing national aspirations and territorial disputes. The Balkans remained a volatile and contested region in the years leading up to World War I, with many of the tensions and rivalries from the Balkan Wars persisting throughout the 20th century.

instagram,"Part of the reason I'm never residing in, or paying rent/taxes to the U.S. government again, is because most American men have lossed their true warrior spirit. The same warrior spirit that Hamas holds. They're willing to fight & die for what they believe belongs to them, & according to my research, the land of Israel belonged to Palestine before the Zionist nation existed. American men are more concerned with watching other men throw balls around all day, gossip, & begging their corrupt government for hand-outs. Lol. Meanwhile, the world is on the brink of World War 3. There are dozens of Islamic nations which have already declared they're supporting Hamas during this war. The U.S. has already stated that they're backing Israel. If this conflict escalates, it can easily lead to a global war. 2024, has far greater calamities in store.

instagram,"The Wall Street Journal reported that officials from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have partnered with Hamas since August to prepare for the breach of Israel's borders. The outlet reported the two groups finalized the plan last Monday during a meeting in Beirut, according to officials from both Hamas and IRGC.

While the US has not yet publicly confirmed that IRGC and Hamas planned the attacks together, CNN reported one official said, ""of course Iran is in the picture,"" adding that ""they've provided support for years to Hamas and Hezbollah."" 

Representatives for the Israeli Defense Force and Palestine's President Mahmoud Abbas did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider.

Iran has long supported international militant groups, including Palestine's Hamas and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, providing the groups with financial assistance and military hardware. Hamas and Hezbollah have vowed to fight for Israel's destruction, per the Journal, with Hezbollah leaders praising the attacks by Hamas.

While Hamas fighters have made up the bulk of the attacks on Israel this weekend, Hezbollah fighters have reportedly been firing on Israeli forces since the escalation in the conflict began. Hezbollah focused missile strikes on a contested portion of the Israel, Lebanon, and Syria border on Sunday, according to reporting by the Associated Press. At the same time, Hamas exchanged strikes with Israel over the Gaza Strip.

There have been no widespread reports of involvement by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in this weekend's conflict in Israel outside of helping to plan the attack by Hamas forces.

Israeli authorities say at least 700 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded by Hamas' strikes this weekend, with some taken hostage. The Palestinian Health Ministry reports 313 dead and 2,000 injured by Israeli counter-strikes.

The declaration of war this weekend is an escalation of decades of tension between the two groups since the founding of Israel in 1948, including the forced evictions of Palestinians from newly-declared Israeli land, and years of deadly missile strikes exchanged between the two nations.",,565,"{'like_count': 538, 'comment_count': 27, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-09 07:11:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyK1FjXuarY/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386942108_1391221911470050_8239346197031200316_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=c-EMje0jL_oAX-lRsmo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAnN7sgwiRRbszL0CN-__Zpc6eqxznPrYcMOnPOCsWViA&oe=652A2F4D

In addition to commenting on X in support of Palestine, the former adult film actress also criticized fashion mogul Kylie Jenner for her pro-Israel Instagram story.

Since Saturday's infiltration by Hamas terrorists into Israel and the launch of more than 3,000 rockets from Gaza, as well as the subsequent counterattack by the Israel Defense Forces, more than 1,100 people have been killed in Israel and Gaza.

Moreover, Kylie Jenner received criticism from Mia Khalifa for her pro-Israel post, which she later deleted after she was trolled.

instagram,"Marxism in international relations is a theory rooted in the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It focuses on the role of economic factors, class struggle, and capitalism in shaping global politics. Marxists see international relations as an extension of domestic class conflicts, with states representing the interests of ruling classes. They emphasize the impact of imperialism, global capitalism, and economic inequality on the international system. Marxism also critiques liberal theories and highlights the potential for global revolution to overthrow capitalism. While criticized for oversimplification, Marxism offers a unique perspective on power dynamics and the influence of economic forces in international relations. Marxist and Neo-Marxist international relations theories are structuralist paradigms which reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. Marxist approaches argue the position of historical materialism and make the assumption that the economic concerns transcend others; allowing for the elevation of class as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation.
The real-life examples of Marxism in international relations revolve around economic exploitation and inequality between developed and developing countries. They include the outsourcing of labor to low-wage countries, resource extraction in developing nations, unequal terms of global trade, and the burden of debt on less powerful nations. These examples illustrate how Marxist concepts of capitalism, imperialism, and class struggle can be used to analyze and criticize the dynamics of global economics and international relations.

instagram,"Palestinians celebrate by a destroyed Israeli tank at the Gaza Strip border fence east of Khan Younis on October 7, 2023.

On 7 October 2023, Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas launched a large-scale invasion and offensive against Israel from the Gaza Strip, breaking through the Gaza-Israel barrier and forcing entry via the Gaza border crossings, into nearby Israeli settlements and military installations. It is the first direct conflict within Israel's boundaries since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

Hostilities were initiated in the early morning with a rocket barrage against Israel and vehicle-transported incursions into Israeli territory, with several attacks on surrounding Israeli civilian communities and Israeli military bases. For the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel formally declared war.

instagram,"The recent conflict in Israel, erupted following a surprise attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas based in the Gaza Strip. The conflict marked another chapter in the long-standing and deeply rooted Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hamas's unexpected attack, which included the taking of both military and civilian hostages, caught Israeli security forces off guard. In response, Israel initiated a series of retaliatory strikes on the Gaza Strip. The situation escalated rapidly, with expectations of a potential ground incursion into the enclave. Tensions leading up to this latest round of violence had been steadily increasing. These tensions were exacerbated by various factors, including clashes in Jerusalem and the West Bank, violence at the sacred al-Aqsa Mosque, and the ongoing Israeli occupation and blockade of Palestinian territories. Additionally, the presence of right-wing elements in Israel's government added to the volatility of the situation. Also the involvement of Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party, which expressed solidarity with Hamas and launched attacks on Israeli targets in the Shebaa Farms area. This raised concerns about the conflict's potential to spill over into a broader regional confrontation. The conflict underscored the complexity and sensitivity of the Israel-Palestine issue, with deep-seated grievances on both sides. It highlighted the need for a sustainable and peaceful resolution to the conflict, which has been a source of instability in the region for decades. #israelpalestineconflict #isrealhamaswar #talkdiplomacy #upsc #ham√°s #gazastrip #alaqsamosque #upscmotivation #csstricks #upscaspirants #hezboll√°h #shebaa #warhistory #isrealhistory #palestine #freepalestine #freeisrael #jewish #warandpeace #warandpeacerevival #impending #internationalrelationsstudent #internationalrelations #foreignaffairs #middleeasthistory #middleeast #peaceprevails #wars #unitednations #peaceandjustice",,479,"{'like_count': 469, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 91579}",TalkDiplomacy IR,,2023-10-09 22:03:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/328799506_219447953811073_3104956161528819700_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pw2J3khjfvsAX8PWC77&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDB5PH0Ztb9ehsOpSDE9OQh8wdqO0qrpdwjjvpSRE76eQ&oe=655AEA98,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMbMm3Ptwo/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387264381_603285075353544_5745541693084490503_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nXXph1rw0mMAX_qIv6N&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBygxGNEtsPUfxnOcXaK6neLes6Vc4TiOUDmog7_rB5MA&oe=65367F61
instagram,"Brent was up 3% to nearly $87 a barrel at just after 4AM Eastern Time, while West Texas Intermediate also jumped 3% to just over $85 a barrel. Both benchmarks had spiked as much as 5% at the start of the trading session, before paring back some of those gains.

Crude prices rose amid concerns that major producers, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, could become embroiled in the conflict, potentially causing supply disruptions. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Iranian security officials had helped plan the raids on Israel, citing senior members of the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

""How Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the US get drawn into this will be key,"" Deutsche Bank managing director Jim Reid said in a note. ""Geopolitical risk doesn't tend to linger long in markets but there are many second-order impacts that could come through in the weeks, months and years ahead from this weekends' developments.""

Meanwhile, US stocks looked set to trade lower, with Wall Street worried that higher oil prices could trigger a flare-up in inflation that would encourage the Federal Reserve to carry on hiking interest rates.

Samp;P 500 futures slipped 0.6% ahead of the opening bell, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was on pace to shed around 200 points, coming off the back of a rough week where it erased all its gains year-to-date.

""Despite the geopolitical risks rising in the Middle East over the weekend, US equity futures remain relatively muted in their reaction to these events,"" strategists at Denmark's Saxo Bank wrote in a research note.

""Risk sentiment has not accelerated to the downside in early trading hours. However, it is important to note that the risk picture is very complicated in the short-term depending on how Israel decides to respond,"" they added.

instagram,"The attacks started early Saturday, when militants used paragliders and broke through security fences on Israel's border with Gaza, killing more than 700 people and taking hundreds of civilians and military personnel captive. 

US officials told NBC News the attacks were likely a bid to derail high-stakes negotiations, backed by the US, that were underway to normalize Israel's relations with Saudi Arabia. 

Saudi Arabia has historically refused to recognize Israel's legitimacy, and hostilities between the states date back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. 

But Saudi Arabia's ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, is keen to exploit the economic benefits of potentially normalizing ties with Israel, and there were hopes that other Arab states would follow suit. 

Iran, Hamas' main backer, has long opposed attempts to normalize relations between Israel and its regional neighbors. 

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that US officials were trying to establish if there was any involvement in the Israel attacks by Iran, with conflicting reports emerging over the weekend on whether Iran was involved. 

The success of Israeli-Saudi talks now appears to be remote, with the concessions Riyadh requested in how Israel treats Palestinians even less likely to be agreed on in the wake of the attack, and Israel's declaration of war on Hamas. 

Hamas itself has said the attacks were a response to Israeli settlers entering the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam and a long-standing flash point.

But a Hamas official also told Reuters that the operation had been years in the making, meaning the group is likely seeking to exploit Muslim grievance over recent events at the site and the wider diplomatic situation is the real motive for the attack. 

""The reality is that while Hamas has dressed up the attack as a response to Israeli incursions around the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, it chose to trigger this conflict ‚Äì at this time and in the way it did ‚Äì as a way to impose itself in that wider diplomacy,"" wrote The Guardian's Middle East correspondent Peter Beaumont.",,454,"{'like_count': 441, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-09 12:57:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLcrfQAugq/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387252487_228408573299519_3988198263233858447_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AZjaSEOGGzoAX-QG0Gu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAhacLrtzwPWmPyWzSgIHMHQH3LIWLQ5ASlt--mdWIaJQ&oe=652C35F6

üì£ The Indian embassy in Tel Aviv, and the Representative Office of India in Palestine have issued advisories asking Indian nationals to ‚Äúremain vigilant‚Äù and ‚Äúdirectly contact the Office‚Äù in case of emergencies due to the conflict between Hamas and Israel.

üáÆüá± FYI: Israel's ambassador to India, Naor Gilon, told reporters on Oct 8 that some Indians expressed a desire to volunteer to fight for Israel against Hamas, but he clarified that Israel does not ask for such assistance.

instagram,"Oil prices have rocketed by almost 5 percent in the wake of the Hamas attack, with some analysts now predicting it could hit $150 per barrel and warning that Americans already facing inflated gas prices will again have to deal with a price surge.

Reuters reports that Oil prices jumped more than $3 a barrel in early Asian trade on Monday:

Commentator Nick Sortor notes that ‚ÄúJoe Biden has drained the strategic petroleum reserves, which will give even more leverage to OPEC+ countries to take advantage of the Israel/Palestine conflict.‚Äù

Zero Hedge notes that ‚ÄúOil prices have been a veritable rollercoaster in just the past 10 days,‚Äù but that ‚ÄúIn retrospect, last week‚Äôs oil tumble now seems like ancient history, and after Saturday‚Äôs unprecedented events in Israel, oil has moved sharply higher after the weekend attack by Hamas against Israel, with Brent topping $88 a barrel to repair some of last week‚Äôs heavy losses, and according to some, set to continue rising until it tops $150.‚Äù

Goldman analysts had predicted oil to get to $100 by mid 2024, but that is now expected to climb higher and faster, particularly if Iran is dragged further into the situation.

instagram,"Deadly attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel have turned attention toward Iran, with the potential to draw Tehran‚Äôs other proxies across the Middle East into an escalating conflict.

Hamas is just one of many Iran-backed groups across the region, stretching from Iraq and Syria to Lebanon and Yemen.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog has said there is no evidence of Iran‚Äôs involvement in the weekend operation that has so far killed more than 1,100 people across both sides, but officials have noted that Iran is a key sponsor of Hamas, providing money, equipment and training. Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer later suggested Iran may have known about the attack in an interview on Bloomberg Television.

Israel now faces a balancing act as it tries to eliminate the threat in Gaza without opening another front with Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon ‚Äî another Iran-backed force that‚Äôs usually presented a bigger military threat than Hamas. Tap the link in bio for more.

instagram,"Statement: CJPME calls on Israel and its allies to define their endgame as the renewed Hamas-Israel violence enters its third day. Calls for a ceasefire from CJPME and others have been ignored, and Israel and its Canadian supporters seem intent only in extracting a price from Palestinians, making no distinction between civilians and militants. While Israel has declared its intent to retaliate forcefully, observers demand to understand Israel‚Äôs endgame, as entering yet another cycle of violence will do nothing to bring peace or security to either Israelis or Palestinians. 

‚ÄúEven if, after some massive offensive, Israel deals a blow to Hamas, the status quo will sadly continue,‚Äù asserts Thomas Woodley, president of CJPME.  Experts on the conflict point out that as long as Palestinians are denied their human rights and freedom, their armed resistance to Israel‚Äôs belligerent occupation and apartheid is bound to continue. ‚ÄúFor the sake of both Israelis and Palestinians, world leaders must insist on a plan whereby there is hope for a different future,‚Äù continued Woodley.

In the context of Israel's indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in Gaza, CJPME warns that Canada‚Äôs expressions of ‚Äúfull support‚Äù to Israel will be understood as a green light to commit further massacres.

instagram,"The Battle of Ecnomus, fought in 256 BC during the First Punic War, was not only the largest naval battle of its time but also a clear indication of Rome's emerging naval prowess and its ambition to dominate the Mediterranean.

In 256 BC, the First Punic War had been ongoing for years, with the control of Sicily being a major bone of contention between Rome and Carthage. Sicily's strategic importance, owing to its fertile lands and economic resources, made it a highly sought-after prize for both powers, intensifying the conflict.

Ecnomus was strategically vital as it lay along the sea route connecting Rome and Carthage. Command over this region was pivotal for maritime supremacy and the ability to reinforce troops and resources in Sicily.

Under the leadership of the Roman consul Marcus Atilius Regulus, the Roman fleet faced off against the Carthaginian fleet, led by Adherbal and Hamilcar, near the shores of Ecnomus in Sicily. The scale of this naval clash was immense, with hundreds of ships from both sides, including warships and transport vessels, participating.

The Battle of Ecnomus did not yield a clear victor, and both sides suffered substantial losses. Nevertheless, it battle showcased Rome's resolve to challenge Carthage's naval dominance and marked a turning point in its naval history. It also laid the foundation for Rome's journey to maritime supremacy. Although the outcome was inconclusive, it bolstered Rome's confidence and played a pivotal role in its ultimate victory in the First Punic War.

In conclusion, the Battle of Ecnomus highlights Rome's determination and growing naval capabilities during the First Punic War. This pivotal engagement, while not producing a clear winner, significantly influenced ancient history and established Rome as a formidable force both on land and at sea.

instagram,"üíî The recent events at Nova Festival in Israel have left an indelible mark on our hearts. What should have been a celebration of music's power to unite and bring joy turned into a nightmarish tragedy, leaving families shattered and dreams in ruins. As we grieve for the lives lost and the innocence stolen, we must also remember that music has the incredible ability to heal and mend even the deepest wounds. 

Today we mourn not just for those lost at Nova Festival but also for those who lost their lives in the subsequent attacks in Gaza, as the relentless cycle of violence raged on.

Let us stand together, bound by our shared humanity, and work towards a world where such senseless violence is nothing but a distant memory.

üåç In this moment of profound sadness, we extend our thoughts and prayers not only to those affected in Israel but also to the lives lost in the ongoing conflict in Gaza. 

We must strive for a future where peace reigns, where festivals like Nova become symbols of unity and love, and where music continues to bridge divides and light up our souls. 

Together, as a global community, we can make a difference, and together, we can build a world where tragedies like this are no more. üïäÔ∏èüôè

instagram,"Nagorno-Karabakh brings back painful memories of 1915 for Armenians globally: Avedis Hadjian

Down To Earth speaks to author Avedis Hadjian about the humanitarian crisis in the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in the South Caucasus

The long-running conflict between Azerbaijan and the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in the South Caucasus region ended on September 20, 2023, with Azerbaijani forces overrunning the enclave after a 10-month-long blockade, followed by a massive aerial and artillery campaign.

The enclave, which had an Armenian majority and an Azeri minority is now mostly devoid of its Armenians, who have moved across the border to Armenia.

The conflict, which has claimed thousands of lives since its start at the time of the breakup of the erstwhile Soviet Union, has now led to a humanitarian crisis with refugees streaming into Armenia.",,385,"{'like_count': 385, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 235458}",Down To Earth,,2023-10-09 13:53:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/275694039_1134376340645504_1549590261586284544_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0YP1eNZ_4g8AX9XiuaH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBpoevNLaqoDqO8A-IkcWe9IPB5XM-6QErBUQMzJ6in8g&oe=6559C0AC,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLjDg0rtrN/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387693458_861459238685077_8627787269314811885_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=h1S6eSlrjZsAX99pfoc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCuECON7Fwu5CsfXyMpQWrlYK9YgLoQaEg7hFGWpYZY4g&oe=6537DA90

instagram,"What happened: On Monday, Israeli forces engaged in a battle to have control of the desert surrounding the Gaza Strip and to facilitate the evacuation of people from the tumultuous border region. This came as the death toll in the conflict with Hamas exceeded 1,100 by the third day of clashes.

Details: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning on Sunday, cautioning Israel to brace for an extended conflict. This came a day after the Palestinian group Hamas initiated an attack from Gaza, launching a barrage of rockets and deploying fighters who targeted civilians and took at least 100 hostages. As of Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that over 700 Israelis had lost their lives since the commencement of the attack.

What you need to know: In Gaza, officials reported a minimum of 413 casualties in the densely populated and blockaded area, home to 2.3 million people. The region had endured extensive Israeli airstrikes targeting 800 locations, heightening concerns of an imminent ground invasion. To confront remaining Hamas fighters in the southern region, tens of thousands of Israeli forces were deployed, where the bodies of civilians were discovered scattered on roads and in town centers.
""The enemy still maintains a presence on the ground,"" remarked military spokesman Daniel Hagari as the second night descended following the initial massive attack.

instagram,"US to send military ships,aircraft closer to Israel as conflict continues.

The United States will send multiple military ships and aircraft closer to Israel as a show of support, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, with Washington believing Hamas' deadly attacks may have been motivated to disrupt a potential normalizing of Israel-Saudi Arabia ties.

Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns as the country suffered its bloodiest day in decades on Saturday. Israel battered Palestinians with air strikes in Gaza on Sunday, with hundreds reportedly killed on both sides.

The spiraling violence threatens to start a major new war in the Middle East.

At least three Americans were among those killed, CNN reported on Sunday, citing a U.S. memo.

Austin in a statement said he ordered the moving of the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean closer to Israel. The force includes the carrier, a guided missile cruiser and four guided missile destroyers.

Austin also said the United States had also taken steps to augment U.S. Air Force F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter aircraft squadrons in the region. He said the United States would also provide munitions to Israel.

U.S. President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday that additional assistance for the Israeli Defense Forces was on its way to Israel and more would follow in the coming days, the White House said after their call. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris also held a call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog.

The Pentagon in a later statement said Austin spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to update him on U.S. responses and ""to express support for the people of Israel and to receive updates on Israel's operation to restore security and safety from Hamas' terrorist attack.""

""The Secretary reaffirmed the unwavering support of the United States for Israel's right to defend itself,"" the statement said. It said Austin underscored that the U.S. steps ""were taken to strengthen the U.S. military posture in the region to bolster regional deterrence efforts.""",,380,"{'like_count': 370, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 82565}",kashmir_news_24√ó7 (official),,2023-10-09 04:47:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/95946022_519787842050015_3508014650400702464_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4ECpW61sx2EAX_-ul95&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA-j6WT2C_uGiiMG-7h8q8U_CLp7ZmuWtphy2avMYxKww&oe=655A8030,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyKkoXZvTfE/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387742773_651838643748778_4036407667063343219_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9gdW5Ga1k7gAX88pGqB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBmC_C6EMDwzgaeL7BnNMP3kwtpB2vn72VZEq7peefyQw&oe=65383006

instagram,"It really disturbs and saddens me to see Palestinian militants go into Israel and kill  hundreds of innocent Israelis , and Israeli army go to Gaza in retaliation and kill thousands of innocent Palestinians. But those are people who champion monotheism and the belief in one God and claim the same ancestor, Abraham. Why can',t these brothers who teach the world about how great their God and religion is, get along and be at peace with each other? This is crazy to me. War is not the solution no matter who is right or wrong in the eyes of their supporters.  We should all advocate for peace in the Middle East no matter what side we are on whether we are pro-Israelis or pro-Palestinians. At the end of the day every individual and group and nation should not be without a place to call home. No one, individual or nation, Jews or Palestinians deserve to be homeless. Until the Palestinian people are allowed to have their own nation and the Israelis are able to live in peace in their nation as well, this conflict will never end and only innocent Palestinians and Israelis will be the victims of extremist politicians and groups on both sides.

instagram,"Wat zich afgelopen weekend in Isra√´l en Palestina afspeelde laat ook de leden van Een Andere Joodse Stem niet onberoerd. Ze pleiten ervoor werk te maken van een toekomst met √©chte vrijheid en gerechtigheid voor iedereen. 

'Wij, Belgische Joden en Joden die in Belgi√´ wonen, zijn diep geschokt door de gewelddadige escalatie in Isra√´l/Palestina die de laatste dagen honderden levens heeft gekost. We rouwen om de doden, de gewonden en het onmenselijke lijden van familieleden, vrienden, mede-activisten, en hun dierbaren, in Isra√´l en in Gaza.'

'De gebeurtenissen van de afgelopen dagen tonen de gevolgen van een jarenlange Isra√´lische strategie om 2,3 miljoen mensen op te sluiten in een belegerde zone, omringd door hekken, bewakingsmechanismen en machinegeweren. En dat onder dreiging van voortdurende bombardementen en zonder enige uitweg om een waardig leven te kunnen leiden.'

'De wortels van het huidige geweld bevinden zich in de onderdrukking van miljoenen Palestijnen. Zowel in Gaza als in andere delen van de bezette Palestijnse gebieden worden zij al decennialang onder de knoet gehouden door het Isra√´lische leger dat bijna elk aspect van hun leven bepaalt. Terwijl Biden, Netanyahu en Arabische leiders diplomatieke deals proberen te sluiten zonder Palestijnen hierbij te betrekken, bewijst de situatie dat dergelijke pogingen om ‚Äòdeals‚Äô te sluiten gedoemd zijn te mislukken.'
 
'De Isra√´lische burgers die de afgelopen dagen het leven lieten zijn eveneens het slachtoffer van het mislukte beleid en van de voortdurende onderdrukking van de Palestijnen door de Isra√´lische regeringen en strijdkrachten. Het intensiveren van de onderdrukking en het geweld zal alleen maar leiden tot nog meer terreur en gruwel, zowel bij Isra√´li‚Äôs als bij Palestijnen. De enige weg om veiligheid en welvaart te garanderen voor burgers aan beide kanten, is door onvermoeibaar verder te werken aan een toekomst waar sprake is van √©chte vrijheid en gerechtigheid voor iedereen.'

I am writing this letter to express my sincere gratitude for the trust and support that you, as a community, have placed in me and Heritage Funeral Home. It has been an honor to serve and care for your families during the most challenging times of their lives. Being able to provide comfort and guidance during times of loss is something that I cherish and value deeply.
 
I also want to thank you for standing by me during difficult times. It means everything to me to have your support and loyalty; I can never express how grateful I am for that. Your unwavering belief in me and the truth has strengthened and comforted me.
 
As we continue to move forward together, I am reminded of the importance of being guided by truth and never allowing rumors or gossip to undermine our beliefs or feelings. The Bible reminds us in Proverbs 16:28 that ""A perverse person stirs up conflict, and a gossip separates close friends."" Therefore, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to the truth and never allow gossip to erode our faith or our relationships with one another.
 
Once again, thank you, Lampasas community, for your trust, support, and loyalty. It is a privilege to serve you, and I look forward to continuing to do so with the utmost care and compassion.
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. James W. Mercer

instagram,"Both the state of Israel and the theocratic group of H@m@s are committing atrocities and war crimes against the common person. Over 300 civillians have been killed or harmed by both sides intentionally, and to make things worse for the Palestinian people, the Gaza strip has been invaded, shelled, and had water and electricity cut off. 

How does this do anything except hurt the common folk? How can Isreal say its defending itself by assaulting the innocent people of the Gaza? How can H@m@s claim they are fighting for the people while targeting civillians? They cannot. 

We must support decentralized local groups to help the people, and resist the tyrants and the oppressors of all ideologies. We must support the common individual and their community in pursuit of equity, freedom, and a secure life. 

I am not hopeful for how this conflict will continue, but I'm hoping for the best for the people

Don‚Äôt miss David Cronenberg's bleak, mind-bending 80's Horror Classic, Videodrome (1983). Now playing the Director‚Äôs cut! Link in bio.

FILM SYNOPSIS: When Max Renn goes looking for edgy, new shows for his sleazy cable TV station: Civic TV, stumbles across the pirate broadcast of a hyperviolent torture show called VIDEODROME. As he unearths the origins of the program, he embarks on a hallucinatory journey into a shadow world of right-wing conspiracies, sadomasochistic sex games, and bodily transformation. Renn's ordinary life dissolves around him, and he finds himself at the center of a conflict between opposing factions in the struggle to control the truth behind the radical human future of ""the New Flesh.""

I had just witnessed the very moment the anti-trans moral panic in this country devolved into the prolonged and violent civil conflict now gripping the United States. The Wi Spa anti-trans clashes led by Proud Boys and Nazis (sanctioned by LAPD and local media) were indicative of what was to come: normalized standoffs and melees against Republican fascists who seek to push LGBTQ+ people out of every corner of our society. Bathrooms. Spas. Schools. Libraries. Sports. It feels like there‚Äôs a Wi Spa clash every week now. Those who fight against the Republican aspirations of genocide are tired and fatigued but our resolve has never been stronger. The mandate for a homogenous and eliminationist society, the very thing that makes fascists so dangerous, is also their greatest weakness‚Äî and we shall exploit it to destroy them. Don‚Äôt forget that they are massively outnumbered. It‚Äôs our inherent responsibility to each other and to the next generation to overpower and crush the far-right.

Israeli military forces were mobilized along the Lebanese border following a suspected infiltration attempt.

The Israeli army later verified that the skirmish took place in the wake of an incursion originating from Lebanon.

According to Israeli media reports, two individuals attempting to infiltrate from Lebanon were fatally wounded during the conflict in the Al-Dhahira region.

Today, I was hit in the face with a full water bottle from violent zionists. This was in San Francisco, a city that is supposed to be progressive. How can someone call themselves progressive while defending colonialism and white supremacy? The terrorist state of Israel has been oppressing and killing innocent Palestinians for DECADES and I find it really funny all the people I‚Äôve seen come forward to support this oppression in the last 2 days. It‚Äôs absolutely sickening. 

I‚Äôve been pro-Palestine for over 8 years, and didn‚Äôt know anything about the conflict before then. Y‚Äôall really should read a book or look at actual news (which, surprise surprise is really hard to actually find). I encourage anyone who thinks Israel is the good guys to do their research.

Why are these people yelling?
I expressed grief for murdered families and because my family is connected to Israel, they thought it meant I was ""choosing sides"" 

Do they understand there are no SIDES, only brothers sharing devastating ongoing misery?? Do they understand the difference between civilians and governments? Do they know how many of the hundreds of murdered Israelis have been fighting for peace for decades while Hamas is carelessly sacrificing Palestinians as fodder in a proxy war that does not seek peace whatsoever? Are they jumping on an easy bandwagon of hatred from afar or have they been doing the work on the ground with the people there who ACTUALLY WANT PEACE?

Do they know how many centuries Jews have held tragedies while the unexamined rhetoric is simply ""we deserved it""? Is there any other country in the world whose citizens are so thoroughly blamed for the actions of their government that it makes sense to laugh and cheer in response to innocent peaceful people being raped and dragged through the streets? Do they have any real understanding of the complex history of the land and how that's been used to justify a never ending conflict?

All I know is that it's a lot easier to see ""sides"" rather than have compassion when a loved one's blood is still on your fingertips, and that's part of what's been going on for decades, with little to no curiosity in the west about what's actually at play or what's needed for peace. Lazily posting a flag in response to mass murder is not a radical voice for freedom from oppressors, but turning a blind eye to an intensely violent regime that is harming both Palestinians and Israelis, all of whom deserve peace and homeland",,316,"{'like_count': 275, 'comment_count': 41, 'num_users': 11265}",Kimchi Cuddles,,2023-10-09 17:43:49,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15035769_1724246011229037_3950741249366949888_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=IY2dkI8QpIEAX_85Y8m&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDZDdYh74c4FLCEhUBorhBCIQkHbzkNmRfPQZyt3ph5wQ&oe=655A018B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyL9dFtu7T4/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387267040_327184649992469_8811428261509267514_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CWLMcHjnyTEAX-OpgTW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAlytUZIxG7NLnCU_nqu6RcomE9sMIxCfJ023ttPTCEvA&oe=6559DF96

instagram,"Let us come together in prayer for all those affected by the conflict in the Holy Land. May the comforting hand of God be upon them, bringing solace, strength, and a path towards lasting peace.

Prayer for Peace‚ÄîPope Francis

Lord God of peace, hear our prayer!

We have tried so many times and over so many years to resolve our conflicts by our own powers and by the force of our arms. How many moments of hostility and darkness have we experienced; how much blood has been shed; how many lives have been shattered; how many hopes have been buried‚Ä¶ But our efforts have been in vain.

Now, Lord, come to our aid! Grant us peace, teach us peace; guide our steps in the way of peace. Open our eyes and our hearts, and give us the courage to say: ‚ÄúNever again war!‚Äù; ‚ÄúWith war everything is lost‚Äù. Instill in our hearts the courage to take concrete steps to achieve peace.

Lord, God of Abraham, God of the Prophets, God of Love, you created us and you call us to live as brothers and sisters. Give us the strength daily to be instruments of peace; enable us to see everyone who crosses our path as our brother or sister. Make us sensitive to the plea of our citizens who entreat us to turn our weapons of war into implements of peace, our trepidation into confident trust, and our quarreling into forgiveness.

Keep alive within us the flame of hope, so that with patience and perseverance we may opt for dialogue and reconciliation. In this way may peace triumph at last, and may the words ‚Äúdivision‚Äù, ‚Äúhatred‚Äù and ‚Äúwar‚Äù be banished from the heart of every man and woman. Lord, defuse the violence of our tongues and our hands. Renew our hearts and minds, so that the word which always brings us together will be ‚Äúbrother‚Äù, and our way of life will always be that of: Shalom, Peace, Salaam!

Amen.

Gaza‚Äôs health ministry said there were dozens of Palestinians killed and wounded in Israeli air strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp. Israel has launched hundreds of strikes on Gaza since Saturday, when Hamas fighters launched attacks in Israel and fired thousands of rockets at the country.

The death toll in the Gaza Strip rose to 560 on Monday, the health ministry in the Palestinian enclave said.

The Hamas-controlled ministry said ‚Äú570 people were killed and another 2,900 injured‚Äù in the fighting that began on Saturday after Hamas fighters fired thousands of rockets in Israel in a surprise dawn offense.

Israel has not released an official toll but its media said at least 700 people were killed in Saturday‚Äôs attacks, children among them.

instagram,"Israeli forces continue to battle Hamas fighters as they work to reclaim several towns, with the ongoing conflict exceeding initial expectations, as Hamas fighters crossed the Gaza fence and launched a deadly rampage.

""It's taking more time than we expected to get things back into a defensive, security posture,"" Lt. Col. Richard Hecht told journalists.

Fighting still persists in seven to eight locations, which were captured by the Hamas fighters. This incursion has resulted in the deaths of 700 Israelis and the abduction of numerous hostages, marking a significant departure from Israel's historically perceived invincibility.

In response, Israel has unleashed its most intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip to date, killing over 400 Palestinians. There is also speculation regarding a potential ground assault on the territory, which Israel had vacated nearly two decades ago.
