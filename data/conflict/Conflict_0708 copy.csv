facebook,"The Timeless Grandeur of Carcassonne: A Tale of History, Heroes, and Hope In the heart of the Languedoc region in the south of France, where the languid Aude River meanders through the rolling hills, there stands a testament to time, a jewel of medieval grandeur, a castle and walled city that have witnessed centuries of history and countless stories. This is the enchanting tale of Carcassonne. A Castle Born of History Carcassonne, whose origins date back to the Roman era, is a name that resonates with history. But it wasn't until the 12th century that it truly began to weave its destiny into the annals of time. It was then that the Visigoths, a Germanic people, fortified the hill where Carcassonne now stands, laying the foundation for the castle and walled city that would become legendary. As the medieval world swirled with political intrigues and religious fervor, Carcassonne became a pivotal player in the tumultuous events of the Albigensian Crusade. This conflict, rooted in religious schisms and political power struggles, pitted the Catholic Church against the Cathars, a Christian sect deemed heretical by the papal authority. The formidable walls of Carcassonne bore witness to one of the most dramatic episodes in its history. In 1209, when the Crusaders arrived, led by Simon de Montfort, the city and its inhabitants found themselves trapped in a harrowing siege that would last for more than a year. Despite the odds stacked against them, the defenders of Carcassonne displayed unyielding courage and resilience. The Defenders of Carcassonne Among these defenders was Dame Carcas, a name that has since become an emblem of Carcassonne's indomitable spirit. The story goes that as the city endured the relentless siege, its supplies began to dwindle. Desperation loomed, but Dame Carcas, a woman of unshakable resolve, devised a cunning plan. She gathered the remaining food in the city, which amounted to little more than a single pig and a small sack of grain. Dame Carcas, in a display of defiance that would be remembered for centuries, had the pig fattened and then hurled it over the city walls, landing with a resounding thud before the besieging Crusaders. The sight of a seemingly well-provisioned city spurred rumors that Carcassonne still had ample resources. The Crusaders, believing they faced a futile task, eventually lifted the siege. Dame Carcas became a symbol of the city's tenacity, and it is said that her name, combined with the Occitan word for ""ring"" (cassa), gave birth to the name ""Carcassonne."" Whether this is true or merely a romanticized legend, it is a testament to the power of human spirit and the ingenuity that can arise in times of great adversity. The Splendor of Medieval Architecture Walking through the cobbled streets of Carcassonne today, one is transported to the medieval world. The castle and walled city are a time capsule, preserving the architectural grandeur of centuries past. The outer walls, punctuated by towering watchtowers and fortified gates, wrap around the city like a protective embrace. These walls, constructed primarily in the 13th century, stand as a testament to the military prowess of the time. As you trace their formidable path, you can almost feel the echoes of countless sentinels who once patrolled the ramparts, their eyes fixed on the horizon in vigilant defense. The inner city is a labyrinth of narrow streets, alleys, and squares. Each stone tells a story, each corner whispers secrets from the past. The Basilica of Saint-Nazaire, a Gothic masterpiece, rises majestically within the walls, its stained glass windows flooding the interior with a kaleidoscope of colors. Its vaulted ceilings and intricately carved choir stalls stand as a testament to the medieval craftsmanship that once flourished here. A Place of Refuge and Culture Carcassonne was not just a fortress; it was also a place of culture and refinement. The medieval courts of the Trencavel lords who ruled over Carcassonne were known for their patronage of troubadours, the poets and minstrels who sang of love and chivalry. It was a time when art and literature flourished within these walls, amidst the backdrop of siege and strife.

facebook,"Today, Israel declared a state of war following thousands of rockets launched by militant organisation Hamas. This escalation follows months of increasing violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a level of casualties in the occupied West Bank not seen in years. In an unprecedented move, militants infiltrated southern Israeli towns using motorcycles, SUVs, and paragliders. Videos circulating on social media depict militants firing at civilians in Israel's southern towns. One video, filmed by a resident in Sderot, captures Hamas militants firing at civilian cars on the street. The resident recorded the video from his terrace and is seen hastily taking cover as a gunman briefly looks in his direction. There are also reports, including videos from Gaza, showing militants dragging the bodies of several Israeli soldiers onto the streets in celebration. This surge in violence comes a day after Hamas, which governs Gaza, stated that the ""people had to draw a line to end the occupation"" and accused Israel of continuing to commit crimes, particularly at the holy site of Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem. In a pre-recorded speech, Hamas militant leader Mohamed Deif declared, ""We have decided to put an end to all of this, with the help of God, so that the enemy understands that the time of recklessness without accountability is over.

facebook,"The Hei√∞inn Chronicles ""It is not always hate or anger which stirs us to weapon play, but more often justice and defense, honor and retribution, love of friend, family, home, and care of livestock. Many times blood is shed because it is the right thing to do, the honorable thing to do; just as often blood is shed because one did not draw blade, but instead tried to bargain with one's Wyrd. The Norns cannot be negotiated with, accept your Wyrd, meet it bravely, let the blood spill where it will. The Way of the Hei√∞inn is the Way of acceptance of these things. We are not meek, not weak, nor do we refrain from conflict. There are many other Walks in life that do ask one to refrain from strife however. Those Folk will always have need of those that will Stand. This is good, it gives us balance, all are welcome to the Way which best serves them.

facebook,"Kenya joins the rest of the world in solidarity with the State of Israel and unequivocally condemn terrorism and attacks on innocent civilians in the country. The people of Kenya and their government hereby express deepest sympathy and send condolences to the families of all victims. We also wish a speedy recovery to the injured. Kenya strongly maintains that there exists no justification whatsoever for terrorism, which constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. All acts of terrorism and violent extremism are abhorrent, criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of the perpetrator, or their motivations. The international community must mobilise to bring the perpetrators, organizers, financiers, sponsors, supporters and enablers of these reprehensible criminal acts of terrorism to account and speedily bring them to justice. In consideration of the complex and delicate context of the security situation in Israel-Palestine, Kenya also makes a call for the de-escalation of violence and urges all parties to restrain from further military action, given its potential to intensify carnage and the suffering of innocent civilians, and to trigger heightened tension in the region and beyond. We are profoundly disturbed that civilians continue to be intentionally targeted in this conflict, as a consequence of which the number of casualties continues to rise. We therefore call on all parties to respect the rights of civilians and honour their obligations under international law. Finally, we take this opportunity to reiterate our firm stand in solidarity with all those calling on the parties to desist from further attacks, promptly effect cease-fire and embark on a path towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.",,3182,"{'like_count': 2037, 'comment_count': 958, 'num_users': 2605286}",William Samoei Ruto,,2023-10-07 17:13:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/306746637_670117021136241_6569537366538106439_n.jpg?stp=c0.8.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Z8er7wOKkMsAX8UCLrd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAo3D-94faGZtNBX9_8aZgpoSqHi13mr1bXBywgg9QH7Q&oe=6559AAFF,https://www.facebook.com/100044138484360/posts/918825762932031,

Saya menyeru kepada seluruh umat Islam untuk menunaikan solat hajat, membaca doa qunut nazilah dan bermunajat untuk saudara Islam kita di bumi Gaza, serta mengadakan 'Himpunan Solidariti bersama al-Quds' sebagai bantahan terhadap tindakan zalim Israel yang merampas tanah bumi Palestin.

Let us also convene a 'Solidarity Gathering for al-Quds' as a strong protest against Israel's oppressive actions, which continue to infringe upon Palestinian territory.

facebook,"Ayinla Omowura: Life And Times Of An Apala Legend This book is a narrative of the life and times of one of the most profound and unarguably, one of the most original Yoruba musicians of post-colonial Nigeria. Murdered in a barroom brawl in Abeokuta, Ogun State in 1980, Ayinla Omowura, forty years after his untimely passage, has refused to die, both in the consciousness of the people of southwest Nigeria, even elsewhere, as well as in the hearts and on the lips of the people. The book plots the graph of Omowura‚Äôs youth, his musicality, family, the fatality of his early departure, and events that led to his death. From the lens of family, friends, his songs, and relics of people who interfaced with him while alive, a narrative is constructed here about the short life of music and society that Ayinla lived. He was a lay scholar, an ombudsman, autodidact, and carrier of the cultural burden of his Yoruba people. Having tasted life in pre and post-colony, the latter being a time when there was beginning to appear noticeable conflicts between traditional life and modernity, Ayinla taught with his music that the latter could only exist if the values of the former are embedded into it. Having lived a rough life at youth and now, thrust to the top of society by fame and cash in his later life, Ayinla never recovered from the conflict this posed. He didn‚Äôt really realize the enormous roles expected of his catapult to the top of high society. This, in part, was responsible for his early tragic exit.

facebook,"The other night I was invited out for a night with the girls. I told my husband that I would be home by midnight, 'I promise!' Well, the hours passed and the margaritas went down way too easily. Around 3 a.m., a bit loaded, I headed for home. Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hallway started up and cuckoo-ed 3 times. Quickly, realizing my husband would probably wake up, I cuckoo-ed another 9 times. I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution, in order to escape a possible conflict with him. (Even when totally smashed... 3 cuckoos plus 9 cuckoos totals = 12 cuckoos MIDNIGHT!) The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, I told him 'MIDNIGHT'. He didn't seem pissed off in the least. Whew, I got away with that one! Then he said 'We need a new cuckoo clock.' When I asked him why, he said, 'Well, last night our clock cuckoo-ed three times, then said 'oh shit.' Cuckoo-ed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckoo-ed another three times, giggled, cuckoo-ed twice more, and then tripped over the coffee table and farted..üòÉ",,1563,"{'like_count': 300, 'comment_count': 60, 'num_users': 86806}",Silver Laughter,,2023-10-07 22:00:37,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/355350263_871560410996103_8196266450273767590_n.jpg?stp=c0.7.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=OttvBBeyjN0AX-RBoec&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBsgcQs77rVZd4PUuIvPyeb_FFRlLCYqSwGsO5Vsj-k_Q&oe=655A713F,https://www.facebook.com/100044264572170/posts/942870820531728,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/375977143_928558051963005_7275362863694891583_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=irOQBiOpBwoAX_ZpiLw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD74t9m6UuSg5-6GyIYDwMiwJdZNKrs9wjE6EKQNYu48w&oe=652668AB

facebook,"On this date in 1984, PREFAB SPROUT released the single, WHEN LOVE BREAKS DOWN, (October 7th, 1984). Prefab Sprout's second studio album was a shimmering jazz-pop masterpiece distinguished by Paddy's witty and inventive songwriting. The album, carrying a duration of 45 minutes and 22 seconds, traverses a myriad of human weaknesses such as regret, lust, and infidelity, all explored with cynical insight and sarcastic flair‚Äã‚Äã. One track that stood out was ""When Love Breaks Down,"" the band's first of seven UK Top 40 hits and a song that marked their first chart appearance in the United States. ""When Love Breaks Down"" is a reflection of Paddy's romantic experiences and is characterized by a bittersweet and poignant mood. Phil Thornalley, a former member of the Cure, produced this song, marking it as the only track on the album not produced by Thomas Dolby. The radio-friendly production and emotionally resonant lyrics made this song one of the most straightforward and heartfelt that Paddy had written to that point in his career‚Äã‚Äã. Despite the individual success of ""When Love Breaks Down,"" the album ""Steve McQueen"" only managed a #21 spot in the album charts. Nonetheless, the album's refined and sophisticated tone did not go unnoticed, and it ultimately made the NME‚Äôs list of the best hundred LPs ever made. The album was titled ""Steve McQueen"" in all countries except for the United States, where it was named ""Two Wheels Good"" due to a legal conflict with the estate of the American actor Steve McQueen. In a 2009 interview with Mojo magazine, Paddy was critical of one line in ""When Love Breaks Down,"" namely ""absence makes the heart lose weight."" He felt it was ""prissy, glib, too thought out."" Despite this self-criticism, ""When Love Breaks Down"" remains a popular song that has been covered by numerous artists, including the Zombies, E'voke, Kate Walsh, Lisa Stansfield, Portastatic, Snow Patrol, and Nerina Pallot‚Äã‚Äã. The B-side to the original single release was ""Diana,"" which was later re-recorded and included on the album ""Protest Songs"" in 1989‚Äã‚Äã. PREFAB SPROUT PADDY McALOON was an anomalous character amidst the pop climate of the '80s who applied himself to the craft of songwriting with the devotion of his heroes, songwriters like Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach and Stephen Sondheim. Following a period studying English at Newcastle, he formed Prefab Sprout and together produced a torrent of compelling songs that found inspiration in sources as diverse as George Gershwin, The Beatles and Steely Dan. On Swoon, the debut album recorded in 1983, tracks like ‚ÄòTechnique‚Äô, ‚ÄòCruel‚Äô and ‚ÄòElegance‚Äô were dazzling discourses on love and loss. Accused by ill-minded hacks of a high and mighty cleverness, almost intellectual snobbery, Prefab Sprout pushed on and released a second album, Steve McQueen, in 1985. Produced by pop guru Thomas Dolby, the record was a collection of sophisticated and life-affirming songs that brushed the line between heartbreak and recovery, and captured the essence of both, all with an added self-absorbed sting. Suffering a similar fate to the singles it spawned, not to mention the several attempts to push the gorgeous ‚ÄòWhen Love Breaks Down‚Äô into the Top Twenty, ‚ÄòSteve McQueen‚Äô only managed a #21 spot in the album charts; but some consolation perhaps came when it made the NME‚Äôs list of the best hundred LPs ever made. In an interview with the October 2009 edition of Mojo magazine, McAloon was critical of one of this song's lines. He said: ""I became very conscious of other people making hit records and I wanted to be there with Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Scritti Politti. It would be nice to have a song the milkman could whistle, I like the glory of language, the gag.""",,1300,"{'like_count': 709, 'comment_count': 53, 'num_users': 1393387}","Decade 77-87 - a grown up disco: new wave, punk, postpunk, goth & indie",,2023-10-07 10:25:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/291674570_183282620765062_2413747408602100470_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=d62aL4NmQKUAX9NEnqg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCOWMxKVpw64z0Yl0myKRs8nEz7ZfU2qNItchoC3zYQKQ&oe=655A6681,https://www.facebook.com/100072499751661/posts/349073044186018,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/380709890_753786576763394_8954009211659097114_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad6a45&_nc_ohc=IAwfmNQZrqYAX9IDonc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAnSa1PoRDYrWTlIKcWp5LOlBpJtuhvwr5Nx1uLbSNOsA&oe=6526C89B

Over 5,000 rockets pierced the sky towards Israel on a festive holiday morning as loud sires blared across the country. Footage from security cameras showed them entering the city in pick-up trucks and motorbikes. Israel initiated strikes on targets within Gaza, setting the stage for what appeared to be the start of another intense round of conflict. #Israel #Gaza #Attack #TimesNow #TimeNowNews #TNOriginals #TimesNowOriginals",,1152,"{'like_count': 291, 'comment_count': 333, 'num_users': 7217840}",TIMES NOW,,2023-10-07 11:32:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/355883259_665377992300133_4106469210640309558_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=wZFrJPkSF5kAX8hewYT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCy0XnqXvEmqAuVaSCI63tcKL8yd-RAMhq2ZciCdw9w1g&oe=6559E717,https://www.facebook.com/100064838136629/posts/736399911864607,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/370238802_1082978726368609_304890783200532590_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=C12Mkyyy9K0AX-R9r5i&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC4wyUXsSFcHAnWEP60zBosAEZD-deGsWXDu6R6Ei8Abw&oe=6557941D

facebook,"On October 6, 1973, 50 years ago, war broke out in Israel. This war was known as the Yom Kippur War and started as a surprise attack during the holiest of Jewish holidays. Once again this morning, surprise attacks came from Hamas during the celebration of a Jewish holiday. Innocent people have been killed, Hamas terrorists have captured dozens of Israelis, including soldiers, and there is no end in sight to this conflict. This is not a moment to turn away. This is a moment to get educated about what is going on. This is a moment to check on your friends in Israel, to check in with your Jewish friends (no matter where they live), and to speak up. Silence at these moments can speak louder than words, and even a text to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of you‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù means the world. This is a moment to amplify your support, to not sit on the sidelines.

BƒÉtƒÉlia care a durat timp de cinci ore s-a dat la marginea nordicƒÉ a Golfului Patras, √Æn largul coastelor Greciei, foarte aproape de baza navalƒÉ a for»õelor otomane de la Lepanto.

The attack marks an unprecedented infiltration into Israel by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen crossing from the Gaza Strip, and the heaviest blow for Israel in the conflict with Palestinians since the suicide bombings of the Second Intifada some two decades ago. üîó Read more at our link in bio üì∑ Amir Cohen",,901,"{'like_count': 305, 'comment_count': 260, 'num_users': 7174549}",Reuters,,2023-10-07 14:51:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/278570575_389433443047394_5275384003700696944_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=zv6fKplAJ3YAX-j1Qof&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDfGk4KxmwMV2Rd1W-aKj0lfPuLLqkEMvFzuwbk1gkQWg&oe=655AE0F1,https://www.facebook.com/100059422245844/posts/802653991725335,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387721965_18386352094030639_5819096654016138783_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=8fO5gbu3PqgAX_GSu4z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBM-knXe-bqI8rww2NJlRi9BLXNkAPyiqYJviAQeDWfMg&oe=6525F042

facebook,"'No matter how spiritually ‚Äúwoke‚Äù we may think we are, we still have deeper issues which can only be worked out within the context of relationship. Left alone, we settle into comfortable patterns that limit the range of our emotional awareness and personal expression. However, once we step out of our comfort zone and open up to others, previously unnoticed/denied aspects of ourselves begin to emerge. At first, they make waves in the calm waters of our hearts, evoking passion and excitement. But when we let them in deeply enough, it‚Äôs like stirring up a pool of still water - all the heavy and messy things which settled at the bottom of our awareness are forced to emerge to the surface. When our otherwise hard-to-reach issues get stirred up for us to look at, we have an opportunity to embrace these fragmented parts of ourselves, to become more integrated and whole. This is a blessing in disguise, albeit a challenging one. Intimate relationships demand a depth of intensity and vulnerability which is the fuel for both transcendent passion and crippling conflict. This is why many esoteric teachings point to the ‚Äúpolar couple/ twin flame‚Äù archetype as the most powerful of alchemical unions. Intimate relationships have the potential for astoundingly accelerated transformation. Whether that transformation leads to conscious evolution or unconscious sabotage depends entirely on each person‚Äôs individual state of Being. If you and your partner aren‚Äôt engaged in sincere, deep, holistic self-work, there can only be 2 outcomes for this kind of relationship. Either you and your partner will settle into a relatively comfortable but very limited relationship of matrix-based pleasures and pursuits where your dysfunctions harmonize, but leave little room for expansion of the soul‚Ä¶ OR‚Ä¶ the relationship will dissolve to make way for something greater in your life. This is the case with the vast majority of relationships in the world, which is why people are often so dissatisfied in relationships. However, if you and your partner are committed to nurture the healing alchemical fire within each other, the richness of this kind of relationship is extraordinary! ~ Humberto Braga Gratitude to unknown artist Healing Intimacy https://EmpowerWholeness.com:=:https://www.empowerwholeness.com/",,889,"{'like_count': 309, 'comment_count': 39, 'num_users': 96074}",Healing Intimacy,,2023-10-07 18:01:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/337868247_2738531212963630_3833005927936680761_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=doOW6BXIMTsAX-vf7lg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBql3ANW0pQsF9FPgXd7O0g8kcZfI9tdvxniRs7Lwvsfg&oe=655A304C,https://www.facebook.com/100090044953305/posts/266633653014798,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386759087_266633066348190_4613521327837613900_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tYzUCE2R8SQAX-JQNcg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAkiJbCxEyRK6Utx6TnqJwwOS4X_Q3pgyHvMj6rbc9tFA&oe=653F4866
facebook,"On this date in 1975, Timothy David Minchin was born in Northampton, England, to Australian parents. On his website he describes himself as a ‚Äúcomedian, actor, composer, songwriter, pianist, musical director and huge rock 'n' roll megastar.‚Äù He grew up in Perth, Australia, where he attended the University of Western Australia and received a bachelor of arts in English and theater in 1995. He went on to obtain an advanced degree in contemporary music at the Conservatorium of Western Australia in 1998. In 2002 he began his career as a musical comedian in Melbourne in shows where he sang original songs while accompanying himself on piano and incorporating more traditional stand-up elements. Minchin came to prominence at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2005 and went on to win the Perrier Newcomer Award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival that same year. Living in London, he toured the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and North America. He has also written the book and lyrics for the Royal Shakespeare Company's adaptation of Roald Dahl's ""Matilda,"" which premiered in Stratford-upon-Avon in December 2010. Minchin is outspoken in his opposition to religion and to nonscientific claims made by New Age groups and others. His comedy and songs cover a wide range of topics, from love and sex to political controversies and language use, but a primary focus is on religion. Many contain strong language but some are safe for radio play, including ‚ÄúPeace Anthem for Palestine,‚Äù which Minchin says sums up his views on religious conflict: ‚ÄúWe don't eat pigs, you don't eat pigs, it seems it's been that way forever. So if you don't eat pigs and we don't eat pigs, why not not eat pigs together?‚Äù He does express fondness for the music of his upbringing in the Anglican Church and the secular and family aspects of Christmas in the Southern Hemisphere in his 2009 single ‚ÄúWhite Wine in the Sun.‚Äù But its hard-hitting lyrics created a firestorm in Australia when the song was released as part of a charitable seasonal album in 2010. Themes of his work include his contempt for unscientific thinking (""If You Open Your Mind Too Much Your Brain Will Fall Out (Take My Wife)‚Äù and for the beauty of scientific thinking in the comedy routine ‚ÄúTony the Fish.‚Äù Minchin returned to touring in 2019 after a seven-year break. The BACK tour visited Australia and New Zealand in March and April, with performances scheduled in October and November in Europe.

facebook,"FIB COMMANDER BRIGADIER ALFRED MATAMBO VISITS KENYA QUICK REACTION FORCE SERVING UNDER MONUSCO IN BENI DRC In a gesture of solidarity and support, the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) Commander, Brigadier Alfred Matambo, paid a significant visit to the Kenyan Quick Reaction Force (QRF) deployed under the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) in Beni. This visit underscores the critical role played by international peacekeepers in promoting stability and security in the troubled region. The Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly the volatile eastern provinces, has been plagued by a long-standing conflict, characterized by militia activities, inter-ethnic violence, and the illicit exploitation of natural resources. The FIB, consisting of troops from various contributing countries, has been a crucial element of MONUSCO's efforts to restore peace and security in this tumultuous region. Brigadier Matambo, a seasoned military strategist and leader, arrived in Kenya QRF Base in Beni to assess the operational readiness and morale of the troops, which has been at the forefront of MONUSCO's efforts in countering armed groups and providing humanitarian assistance to the affected population. During his visit, he commended the Kenyan troops for their dedication and unwavering commitment to the mission's objectives. In a meeting with Kenyan QRF commanders, Brigadier Matambo emphasized the importance of coordinated efforts among MONUSCO forces and the need for adaptability in the face of evolving security challenges. He stated, ""Our mission is not only to protect the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo but also to help create conditions for lasting peace. Your role here is crucial, and your sacrifices are not unnoticed."" The Kenyan QRF, known for their rapid response capabilities, has been instrumental in thwarting attacks, protecting civilians, and providing critical medical aid to the wounded. They have also been involved in community engagement initiatives aimed at fostering trust and cooperation with local communities, a pivotal aspect of peacekeeping in conflict zones. Brigadier Matambo's visit serves as a testament to the international community's commitment to the peace and stability of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The FIB's presence, along with dedicated troop contributions from nations like Kenya, plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the region and creating an environment conducive to the political and socio-economic development that the Congolese people so desperately need. As Brigadier Matambo concludes his visit to Beni, he reaffirms the FIB's unwavering commitment to its mission and expresses gratitude to all peacekeepers, including the Kenyan QRF, for their dedication and sacrifices in pursuit of a peaceful and prosperous Democratic Republic of Congo. The international community continues to stand united in its quest to bring an end to the suffering of the Congolese people and pave the way for a brighter future in the region. https://bit.ly/3RRrdGU:=:https://mod.go.ke/news/fib-commander-brigadier-alfred-matambo-visits-kenya-quick-reaction-force-serving-under-monusco-in-beni-drc/",,825,"{'like_count': 790, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 299429}",Kenya Defence Forces,,2023-10-07 19:30:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271740993_274242824802317_2680389875611401031_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=_0KP4DwpaYQAX8sjjpw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDksVQO9I9DapFGoump3_rns_ij5ZKpFHAINjkUoV0TNg&oe=655A706D,https://www.facebook.com/100066498046550/posts/682225927337336,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387124189_682226007337328_2461145229974420679_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bqpQCVoJ568AX-gwi5G&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCuS7vjBbkoh1Nta226MT9KfFaCLRLa7zZ8fLDWDgjbZA&oe=653E07A9

facebook,"BBC impartiality?: Tony Benn on Gaza. Who remembers the BBC refusing to air a disaster emergency appeal during Israel‚Äôs 3-week massacre of Palestinians in 2009? Prompting Tony Benn to step up to the plate. -Tony Benn on Gaza. In a world often dominated by headlines of conflict and crises, a disconcerting pattern of selective outrage emerges. While the global spotlight swiftly turns to attacks on Israel, there is a troubling media blackout when it comes to Gaza. Here, Palestinians endure the harsh realities of occupation beneath the jackboots of Israeli soldiers, transforming a land into a prison marked by daily oppression and loss of life. Yet the media turns apathetic when Palestinian blood flows daily under occupation. This selective concern betrays naked bias. Reporters profess sympathy for oppressed Ukrainians. After all, there are billions at stake in that particular chess piece, it holds the keys to an end game played to bring about a checkmate. But Palestinians locked in Gaza's concentration camp warrant only cold indifference from the press and international community. It seems some lives engage global passion, others remain invisible. These double standards expose the farce of so-called journalistic objectivity. Corporate media fixates on the favoured narratives of elite interests. Dispossessed Arabs evoke little empathy, however desperate their plight. Of course, no gas, petroleum or pipelines are at stake in Palestine. Thus the victims languish on the barren margins of global concern. Had a profit potential existed, western cameras would magnify every Gazan grievance. Then again maybe that‚Äôs a good thing...who wants to give U.S. any greater reason to get involved in the Middle East, bring democracy at the barrel of a gun. Reputable journalists should expose injustice wherever found, not merely when geopolitics demand attention. But the Palestinians' endless torment attracts scant interest from the commercial press' celebrity gossip chasing corps. Viewers seeking erudite insight must turn to alternative sources, as the mainstream remains devoted to rehashing approved talking points. Don't expect corporate outlets to challenge establishment perspectives or remedy double standards. Their obedience is a given. These biases intensify the ongoing tragedies. But media groupthink thrives in the absence of public scepticism. Citizens too must demand consistent moral principles and factual rigour, not just greater dissemination of perspectives reinforcing their own biases. Apathy enables journalistic failures. The stories we elevate or ignore speak volumes about integrity. On Israel and Palestine, the media stands guilty of gross moral inconsistency. Such willful blindness makes a mockery of journalistic ideals. Credibility requires even-handedness, not preferential treatment granted by parent corporations. Until scrutiny is universal, expect selective narratives serving special interests to reign. #Jerusalem #Gaza #AlAqsaMosque #I",,805,"{'like_count': 398, 'comment_count': 107, 'num_users': 30862}",Labour Heartlands,,2023-10-07 16:18:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/273210778_243997221244505_7910927610259603544_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=FTCUlz3w_Z0AX8tbMnQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAFeNQNfO-s21bD7zF5LMqz_ZjLmj6MJHH3I9sLFZx-cA&oe=6559D7F8,https://www.facebook.com/100069026865802/posts/644737451170478,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/182813609_487210272623976_896187472495685542_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=iaHRO6ggHnQAX9gRLMb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA7Nj4d3kyZ_oTl2i38ehA0gL7DG6XLWrYtHlsQShU7Sg&oe=653AAE58

facebook,"We're back with 5 facts about Hoederer you must know before you claim him as husbando (Nah you can't, he has wife and a child) 1. A multi melee user and also an Arts user Besides a dagger and a sword, Hoederer is also seen carrying a crossbow on his back. After pretending to be part of the Kazdel Royal Court boyband, Hoederer discards the crossbow and acquires a new sword likely given by Manfred. In his playable form, Hoederer wields a larger new sword while keeping his dagger. Hoederer mostly known only as a mele fighter relying on pure combat abilities, turns out he can also use Originium Arts, a fact not even W knew despite them being comrades for years. It's unknown why Hoederer rarely uses his Arts. Before W learns about it in chapter 12 only Ines knew about Hoederer's Arts and called it as Embers. 2. He is unexpectedly a bookworm Mercenary Sarkaz has always been associated with fighting, not least the Darknights trio: W, Ines, and Hoederer. Of the three, Hoederer is probably the least resembling a Sarkaz, even Ines who is cosplaying as Sarkaz looks more like one than him, why? Hoederer always prioritizes dialogue in conflict as much as possible, he always blames himself if things don't go according to plan, always feels uncomfortable after killing to the point that his hands will tremble, and most importantly he likes to read, collect, and write books! Hoederer wrote a book titled ""History of Sarkaz Warfare"" that Manfred lent to Paprika, and it's implied that the book titled ""Struggle and Freedom"" mentioned in W's archive is also his work. If W likes to cook potatoes, Ines has knitting as hobby, then Hoederer is a bookworm. 3. Lost his left eye in order to gain Manfred's trust. After getting an order from Theresis to lead his merc group to Londinium, Hoederer made a plan with W and Ines to reveal and undermine Theresis' plan to keep him from seizing any more power, he helped to fake Ines' death so she could freely work as a spy in the shadows under the guise of a Messenger. Still everything in Victoria is beyond Hoederer's expectation, he was put under house arrest by Theresis, so Hoederer carried out a new plan to gain Manfred's trust so he could roaming around Londinium which would later help Rhodes Island's operation in Londinium. Hoederer told W that he had killed Ines to gain Manfred's trust and lost his left eye as a heavy price to pay, of course by now we know it was all a stageplay that the two had planned. 4. Hoederer killed Scout Yes, Scout was an old comrade of W, Ines, and Hoederer during Babel days. It is said that outside of W and Hoederer, Scout was the first person to gain Ines' trust. Scout was someone respected by W, so why did Hoederer killed Scout? Scout's death was a necessary sacrifice. It was almost impossible for the entire Doctor rescue team to survive Chernobog, so to ensure their survival, Scout made a pact with W. Scout would fight and kill Garcin, the leader of Sarkaz mercenaries aligned with Theresi, with Garcin's death, W could replace Garcin and take control of both the Sarkaz mercenaries from Reunion as well as from Theresis. In return, W would make sure the Doctor's rescue team safely leave Chernobog. After dealing with Garcin, Scout caused a commotion in the core city of Chernobog to distract Reunion's attention from the rescue team. Hoederer and Ines didn't want to kill him and would've preferred to let him go quietly, however, his actions were drawing too much attention from the Reunion forces, so they had no choice but to kill him to maintain the appearance of loyalty to Reunion. Pretty sure he can be justified right? 5. Is it true Hoederer simping for vtuber Eureka? At the April Fool 2023 event when Eureka was managing a stream, there was one viewer with username One Patched Intel who was implied to be Hoederer, the funniest part was that people weren't sure if he would survive in Victoria arc before chapter 12, but since the ""One Patched Intel"" was very chatty during the stream that would take place after the event, players took it as confirmation that Hoederer survived. Regardless, there is no further confirmation until his archives are accessible tomorrow and April Fool's story cannot be considered a canon plot since Haimao literally made a cameo there. Bonus: His name seems to be a reference to a central character in the French stageplay Les mains sales by Jean-Paul Sartre. Parts of Darknights' Memoir and its related characters' stories thematically parallel it, and Hoederer himself shares a number of details with Sartre's Hoederer, a man with a trusting nature who wants a free society, is targeted by many people, and even remains friendly with two people after his head. ----",,697,"{'like_count': 272, 'comment_count': 38, 'num_users': 22215}",Arknights Story Log,,2023-10-07 12:29:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339137950_698897115254379_25466266601688116_n.jpg?stp=c210.267.546.546a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ewUQzCNb7gkAX8f4lYE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBOmW2XAtYBC1IZ4NDQQG13qZKJF4r8bfxWht2CClsooA&oe=655AA352,https://www.facebook.com/100076463650699/posts/333727772519342,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387748907_333727829186003_5903078112464204539_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bn1RUmcLS34AX9v3YqY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBAOtJ2tLs2gMtkk286uVz5tQkQK2HDLPagm8QnkNO0bg&oe=65356803

We will get there in the end. Well done to all you. Congratulations.‚Äù These were the meaningful but rather challenging words of the President during his ‚ÄúTalk to the Troops‚Äù led by no less than Major General Marion R Sison, Commander of 3ID. Also present during the activity were all the Brigade Commanders, Battalion Commanders and more than 300 personnel and Civilian Human Resource of 3ID. Earlier, the Spearhead Troopers met the President's arrival with a warm reception and rendered him with military honors. MGen Sison also gave the President an overview of the 3ID's accomplishments, highlighting the dismantling of the remaining Guerrilla Fronts from eight (8) active in 2018 to three (3) weakened as of the period. A total of 118 Captured, Confiscated, Surrendered and Recovered (CCSR) firearms from various operations conducted against the Communist Terrorist Group (CTG) from 01 January 2023 to 06 October 2023 were also presented to the President. For the period covered, 3ID recorded a total of 73 armed encounters, with six (6) Major Engagements that resulted in the neutralization of 137 CTG personalities, of whom 11 were High Value Individuals (HVIs). In his message, MGen Sison conveyed his gratitude to the President and the Commander in Chief for recognizing the dedicated efforts and achievements of 3ID. ""We are indeed fortunate that our President visited us and acknowledged our efforts to end local communist armed conflict in Western and Central Visayas. More than his presence, may his words inspire all of us to work even harder to accomplish our mission. With strong partnership, cooperation and collaboration with our stakeholders, let us continue to work together towards our goal of declaring our Area of Operations free from the influence of the CTG the soonest time possible,"" the 3ID Commander concluded. #ùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó®ùóªùó∂ùòÅùó≤ùó±ùó•ùó≤ùóπùó∂ùóÆùóØùóπùó≤ #ùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó≤ùóøùóîùóøùó∫ùòÜùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó≤ùóøùóñùóºùòÇùóªùòÅùóøùòÜ #ùó¶ùó≤ùóøùòÉùó∂ùóªùó¥ùòÅùóµùó≤ùó£ùó≤ùóºùóΩùóπùó≤ùó¶ùó≤ùó∞ùòÇùóøùó∂ùóªùó¥ùòÅùóµùó≤ùóüùóÆùóªùó± #ùóîùóôùó£ùòÜùóºùòÇùó∞ùóÆùóªùóßùó•ùó®ùó¶ùóß #ùó¨ùóºùòÇùóøùó£ùóµùó∂ùóπùó∂ùóΩùóΩùó∂ùóªùó≤ùóîùóøùó∫ùòÜ #ùó£ùóÆùóøùóÆùó¶ùóÆùóïùóÆùòÜùóÆùóª #ùóüùóºùòÉùó≤ùó±ùóØùòÜùòÅùóµùó≤ùó£ùó≤ùóºùóΩùóπùó≤ #ùóßùó≤ùóøùóøùóºùóøùó∂ùòÄùòÅùòÄùó™ùóºùóøùòÄùòÅùó°ùó∂ùó¥ùóµùòÅùó∫ùóÆùóøùó≤ #ùóΩùóµùó∂ùóπùó∂ùóΩùóΩùó∂ùóªùó≤ùóÆùóøùó∫ùòÜùòÄùóΩùó≤ùóÆùóøùóµùó≤ùóÆùó±ùòÅùóøùóºùóºùóΩùó≤ùóøùòÄ ùë≠ùíêùíì ùíéùíêùíìùíÜ ùíñùíëùíÖùíÇùíïùíÜùíî, ùíëùíâùíêùíïùíêùíî ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùíóùíäùíÖùíÜùíêùíî ùíçùíäùíåùíÜ, ùíîùíâùíÇùíìùíÜ ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùë≠ùë∂ùë≥ùë≥ùë∂ùëæ ùíêùíñùíì ùíëùíÇùíàùíÜ!",,690,"{'like_count': 313, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 249742}",Philippine Army Spearhead Troopers,,2023-10-07 10:45:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/336888590_6256921364326531_6541009437006587378_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=N-E_NFSB56oAX_gezJr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD3F4aQK6_LppNkZ1rT7540U6iS4yH_k7ARdw5c_rmGSg&oe=655B7222,https://www.facebook.com/100064758784105/posts/710740354427918,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/384561386_638430088405142_8061522689837933692_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad6a45&_nc_ohc=Ocwc4PqGbW8AX8LlkRC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC3gG8lisH9xqYf0f6uUzlrWX49n1N1b0kunADQv2qdZg&oe=652721C6

Similarly, the Psalm presents us with Mary‚Äôs beautiful prayer, the Magnificat, a song of praise, while the gospel talks about the Annunciation, wherein Mary said ‚Äòyes‚Äô to God in complete trust and confidence and without hesitation. Today, October 7, the church celebrates the yearly feast of Our Lady of the Rosary. Known for several centuries by the alternate title ‚ÄúOur Lady of Victory,‚Äù the feast day takes place in honor of a 16th-century naval victory that secured Europe against Turkish invasion. Pope St. Pius V attributed the victory to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was invoked on the day of the battle through a campaign to pray the Rosary throughout Europe. Today‚Äôs memorial, Our Lady of the Rosary, reminds us to be steadfast in prayer and to always trust in the Lord, for he will be with us to strengthen and guide us. PRAYER TO OUR MOST HOLY ROSARY'S LADY O Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, in these times of such brazen impiety, manifest your power with the signs of your ancient victories.

Serangan besar-besaran telah dilancarkan oleh HAMAS dan Jihad Islami dalam 'Operasi Taufan Al-Aqsa' selepas berlakunya ketegangan selama beberapa minggu di sempadan Gaza-Israel. 2. Saya menyeru kepada seluruh umat Islam untuk menunaikan solat hajat, membaca doa qunut nazilah dan bermunajat untuk saudara Islam kita di bumi Gaza, serta mengadakan 'Himpunan Solidariti bersama al-Quds' sebagai bantahan terhadap tindakan zalim Israel yang merampas tanah bumi Palestin.

I earnestly urge all Muslims to engage in hajat prayer, recite the qunut nazilah supplication, and make dua for our Muslim brothers and sisters in Gaza. Let us also convene a 'Solidarity Gathering for al-Quds' as a strong protest against Israel's oppressive actions, which continue to infringe upon Palestinian territory.

Ein gro√üer Teil Israels wird heute mit tausenden Raketen durch die Hamas angegriffen. Der Beschuss t√∂tet, zerst√∂rt und zwingt die Bev√∂lkerung in ihre Schutzr√§ume. Im S√ºden des Landes werden Zivilist:innen ermordet, als Geisel genommen, verschleppt, Leichen gefallener Soldat:innen gesch√§ndet und Videos dieser Verbrechen triumphierend √ºber Social-Media-Kan√§le verbreitet. Es herrschen pogrom√§hnliche Zust√§nde. Ich verurteile all dies auf das Allersch√§rfste! Nichts kann diese Taten rechtfertigen. Mein Mitgef√ºhl gilt allen friedliebenden Menschen auf beiden Seiten der Grenze, die unter Bedrohung leben, die Angeh√∂rige verloren haben oder verletzt wurden. Ich hoffe auf eine baldige Einstellung aller Kampfhandlungen. Dieser jahrzehntelange Konflikt kann nur am Verhandlungstisch gel√∂st werden. (vdb) ____ I am dismayed to hear today's news about the brutal assault at Israel's border with Gaza. A large part of Israel is being attacked today with thousands of rockets by Hamas. The shelling is killing, destroying and forcing the population into their shelters. In the south of the country, civilians are murdered, taken hostage, kidnapped, bodies of fallen soldiers are desecrated, and videos of these crimes are triumphantly broadcasted on social media channels. Pogrom-like conditions prevail. I condemn all this in the strongest possible terms! Nothing can justify these acts. My sympathy goes out to all peace-loving people on both sides of the border who are living under threat, who have lost loved ones or have been injured. I hope for an early cessation of all hostilities. This decades-old conflict can only be resolved at the negotiating table.

It highlights Mary's capacity to assist and guide believers through life's challenges as her intercession is especially powerful due to her closeness to her son, Jesus Christ. This title's historical importance is notably tied to the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 when Pope Pius V called on the faithful to seek Mary's intercession through the Rosary. The resulting victory was attributed to her, cementing the association of ""Our Lady of Victory"" with triumph over adversity. Throughout history, Mary has been a source of hope, courage, and divine help for those facing struggles, whether physical, spiritual, or moral. This title reminds us of Mary's unwavering support for her children.

Or, was he being serious? The statement has come as a shock to many and there is not yet word as to how our Guatemalan counterparts are interpreting his remarks. The comment was made during an interview with the media. A reporter asked Prime Minister Briceno about rising tensions on Sarstoon River and the Guatemalan Armed Forces‚Äò aggressive behavior towards Belizeans. In his comments, PM Briceno noted how small Belize‚Äôs military and population is to Guatemala‚Äôs. He also expressed concerns over potential loss of lives as a result of the conflict. For context, we bring back the PM‚Äôs remarks. We also heard from his Minister of National Defense, Florencio Marin.

Let us also convene a 'Solidarity Gathering for al-Quds' as a strong protest against Israel's oppressive actions, which continue to infringe upon Palestinian territory.

facebook,"Lower Decks S4 ‚Ä¢ Episode 6 - Genesis Conflict? In this weeks episode of Lower Decks, a miniature version of the Genesis Device was featured. Ferengi crew members stated the devices were being used to terraform planets during the late 24th Century. Season 4 takes place around 2383, which is nearly 20 years before Picard Season 3. The Genesis II device was stored in Daystrom Station's vault where Section 31 keeps the Federation's most top-secret technology and artifacts. With that impression, is there a canon conflict? Is it a weapon or a scientific tool, perhaps a secured machine but nonetheless?!? 1. How can Genesis be considered classified and a smaller version is a casual terraforming tool? An unstable creation that formed a planet then self-destructed, due to the use of Protomatter in the Genesis Matrix. 2. How was Starfleet able to resolve the certain complexities which Dr. David Marcus couldn‚Äôt, hence the use of Protomatter? #StarTrek #startrekphoenix #startrektos #StarTrekPicard #StarTrekLowerDecks",,492,"{'like_count': 203, 'comment_count': 234, 'num_users': 41068}",Star Trek: Phoenix,,2023-10-07 22:08:22,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312162533_508377834633547_2341318147813571722_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=pkO1Q0SvWXYAX_oLWK_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAJ_ItATPvn6VIrZ6WtANR-gileuhAGk7CfwrhYeBLtFA&oe=655A58F3,https://www.facebook.com/100063840031103/posts/753457303458931,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387156294_753456183459043_4448820918086451533_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=elE5T43Qo3MAX9p40-K&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBwxVWRFYqgDJpdEUFbatVQgpT0fzODaxE4Jr1ZY7yC7A&oe=652794C2

Serangan besar-besaran telah dilancarkan oleh HAMAS dan Jihad Islami dalam 'Operasi Taufan Al-Aqsa' selepas berlakunya ketegangan selama beberapa minggu di sempadan Gaza-Israel. 2. Saya menyeru kepada seluruh umat Islam untuk menunaikan solat hajat, membaca doa qunut nazilah dan bermunajat untuk saudara Islam kita di bumi Gaza, serta mengadakan 'Himpunan Solidariti bersama al-Quds' sebagai bantahan terhadap tindakan zalim Israel yang merampas tanah bumi Palestin. Al-Quds adalah milik umat Islam.

PAS is closely monitoring the escalating conflict between Palestine and Israel that erupted today. Following several weeks of heightened tension along the Gaza-Israel border, Hamas and Jihad Islami launched a large-scale offensive named 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.' 2. I earnestly urge all Muslims to engage in hajat prayer, recite the qunut nazilah supplication, and make dua for our Muslim brothers and sisters in Gaza.

facebook,"Thank you for your continued prayers for our family and friends‚Ä¶ currently everyone is ok, thank Gd. My sister and her family are in and out of the bomb shelter, as are many in the south. Even in Jerusalem, my aba and family has been hearing sirens and loud explosions through the day‚Äî it‚Äôs craziness. My husband has been talking and reporting about the probability of this on worthy news for the last couple months. Our dear friends the Boskey‚Äôs who live not far from us just sent this timely and detailed update from Southern Israel: Clear news and prayer points. At approximately 06:30 am Israeli time, on a quiet Shabbat morning, we were awakened by the repeating wailing of air raid sirens. For the past four hours the Islamist terror group Hamas has been firing rockets across southern Israel (Beersheva, Arad, Dimona, Sderot, Ashkelon, Ashdod, etc.) and also at the Greater Tel Aviv area and at the outlying suburbs of Jerusalem. Though the Iron Dome anti-rocket defenses have managed to stop most of the rockets, some of landed. A 60 year old woman was murdered by a direct hit; some are moderately wounded. Simultaneously, at least ten white pickup trucks driven by Hamas suicide squad jihadis crossed into Israel (as well as some on ultra-light single-place powered parachutists) and attacked approximately 21 sites, including kibbutzim and moshavim (farms), small towns (including police stations). They have been slaughtering civilians, including mothers and children, breaking into houses and indiscriminately killing the inhabitants. We have friends who have terrorists in their house as I write. At least five IDF soldiers have been kidnapped and spirited away to Gaza. A Hummer armored vehicle most likely belonging to them has been paraded in the streets of Gaza ‚Äì shades of 2 Samuel 1:20: ‚ÄúTell it not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, Or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, The daughters of the uncircumcised will celebrate.‚Äù There are sketchy details of at least 35 others kidnapped. Scores of IDF soldiers have been murdered. Over 80 casualties have been brought to Beersheva‚Äôs Soroka hospital, and other figures quote 150 wounded. The situation of the ground is quite fluid. At the moment of this writing, there are still many active sites of military confrontation between terrorist gangs and Israeli citizens/the IDF ‚Äì 21 sites was the figure Israel‚Äôs Chief of Police mentioned thirty minutes ago. Islamic Jihad has joined in the hostilities against Israel in the last hour. Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif issued a false-flag declaration that these attacks are being done by Muslims outraged at Israel‚Äôs defiling of the Temple Mount. This false charge has been repeated many times since 1929, and has always led to Islamist attacks on Jewish civilians. See previous newsletters which give a historical overview here, here and here. A video was posted of terrorist chiefs rejoicing and then giving thanks to Islam‚Äôs spiritual leader in prayer. The probable spark for this conflict has little to do with the Temple Mount, and everything to do with Iran. Hamas and Islamic Jihad are Iranian client proxies. Iran is catalyzing terror attacks against Israeli civilians to threaten Israel, Saudi Arabia and the USA about the warming of military ties between the Saudis and Israel. This is a warning shot across the bows. Israel has issued a broad call-up of reserves and has called this campaign Operations Iron Swords. The broad nature of this surprise attack, the civilian and military casualties and kidnappings from Israeli cities and kibbutzim ‚Äì these will of necessity require a very strong Israeli response. There have been deaths so far today, and there will undoubtedly be many more. Please pray as the Psalmist did: ‚ÄúArise, YHVH, confront him, make him bow down! Save my soul from the wicked with Your sword‚Äù (Psalm 17:13). How should we then pray? Pray for the defeat and destruction of Islamist terrorist invaders Pray for the physical rescue of Israelis under siege, those who are kidnapped, those who are wounded Pray for divine wisdom and decisive strategy to be given to Israel‚Äôs leaders in every area Pray for the raising up of Ezekiel‚Äôs prophetic Jewish army throughout the earth Your prayers and support hold up our arms and are the very practical enablement of God to us in the work He has called us to do.

facebook,"SATURDAY, 7 OCTOBER TEXT: PROVERBS 13:1-11 TOPIC: A WISE SON (1) TEXT Proverbs 13:1-11 [1]A wise child accepts a parent‚Äôs discipline; a mocker refuses to listen to correction. [2]Wise words will win you a good meal, but treacherous people have an appetite for violence. [3]Those who control their tongue will have a long life; opening your mouth can ruin everything. [4]Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper. [5]The godly hate lies; the wicked cause shame and disgrace. [6]Godliness guards the path of the blameless, but the evil are misled by sin. [7]Some who are poor pretend to be rich; others who are rich pretend to be poor. [8]The rich can pay a ransom for their lives, but the poor won‚Äôt even get threatened. [9]The life of the godly is full of light and joy, but the light of the wicked will be snuffed out. [10]Pride leads to conflict; those who take advice are wise. [11]Wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears; wealth from hard work grows over time. [NLT] INSPIRATION A son is considered wise when he accepts the good advice or teachings of his parents because no good parents will ever mislead their child. Therefore, in Proverbs 13:1-11, the all-knowing God gives us, His children, some pieces of advice and wise is that son who heeds these instructions. In vs.3, God expects us to exercise self-control over our speech and master our tongue for words have the ability to cut and destroy (James 3:6). If you want to have self-control, begin with your tongue. If you can control this small but powerful part of your body, then you can control the rest of your body. God also instructs us to live blameless lives as it safeguards and brings a greater sense of order to our lives. QUESTION: Are you a wise or foolish son? PRAYER: Oh God, help me to be/a wise son who listens to both his earthly and heavenly parents instructions, in Jesus name.

facebook,"# **SIXTY YEARS ON: *‚ÄúThe Birds""*** **By *Ray Cunneff*** **October 7, 2023** **I first saw Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Birds‚Äù at the Sutton Theater in Manhattan in 1963. The theater was on the east side, my apartment on the west side, and I had to walk through Central Park to get home. There were birds everywhere in the park and I was a bit freaked out, having never looked at birds in quite the same way.** **That was sixty years ago. I was a nineteen year old page at NBC at 30 Rock, not long before leaving for Europe with NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúInternational Showtime‚Äù. I had moonlighted as a production assistant on the New York locations for MGM‚Äôs ‚ÄúSunday in New York‚Äù with Rod Taylor and Jane Fonda, but never actually met him. (I did meet Jane Fonda by a rowboat in Central Park, worried about her hair should it capsize.)** **As I‚Äôve written elsewhere, I had become a lifelong fan of Rod Taylor, first with George Pal‚Äôs classic ‚ÄúThe Time Machine‚Äù, but then 20th Century Fox‚Äôs mostly forgotten ABC TV series ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äù. Rod was so good at accents, from upper-class British, to southern gentleman, to Bronx boxer, to American leading man, that few people knew he was Australian - the most famous Aussie since Errol Flynn.** **But as I‚Äôve also written, ‚ÄúThe Birds‚Äù was an affirmation of my self-identification with Rod Taylor. He was the kind of man I aspired to be and, in many ways, became.** **Hitchcock wanted an actor with ‚Äúballs‚Äù. No Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant would do. And, most of all, he wanted an actor with the physical presence and the acting ability to make the terror real and make us believe the danger. And Rod was all of that.** **But as I‚Äôve also written, *‚ÄúNever confuse the actor with the role‚Äù. *I had several opportunities to meet Rod and decided against. Rod Taylor was too important to me to take the chance of not liking him.** **There have been countless reviews and analyses of ‚ÄúThe Birds‚Äù over the last half-century, the technical marvel that it was given the film-making limitations of the time. But at its core, it has always been a character-study, an exploration of how ordinary people behave under extraordinary circumstances ‚Äì when nature turns against us ‚Äì and why the film resonates more powerfully today than it did sixty years ago.** **‚ÄúThe Birds‚Äù has to be one of the most analyzed and debated films ever made because of its intentional ambiguity, the fact that the bird attacks are never explained. Hitchcock was determined it not be considered ‚Äòscience fiction‚Äô, allowing for a wide range of interpretations. Some critics have claimed that it‚Äôs the characters who are the real ‚Äòbirds‚Äô, pecking and clawing at each other.** **What begins as an almost romantic comedy meeting in a bird shop, soon turns almost obsessive as Melanie (Tippi Hedren) seeks out Mitch (Rod Taylor) at his remote weekend family home, beautiful yet vaguely ominous Bodega Bay, and confronts his very needy mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and his old flame Annie (Suzanne Pleshette).** **And as the various relationships and conflicts unfold, suspense slowly builds in a series of escalating, inexplicable bird attacks builds to an all-out assault on the town and on the impromptu family unit boarded up inside the house as wave after wave challenges any illusion of safety.** **Several years ago, I wrote some commentary for Diane Tomasik‚Äôs excellent ‚ÄòThe Complete Rod Taylor Site‚Äô:** ***""The story may seem to be about Melanie Daniels, but it all depends upon Mitch Brenner.""*** ***‚ÄúRod is the center of gravity for the entire film. His performance strikes just the right balance of strength and inner conflict. Too much of one or the other and the whole picture falls apart. His reactions to the birds are what make the terror real and allow us to share it.‚Äù***",,372,"{'like_count': 252, 'comment_count': 67, 'num_users': 97005}",1950s-60s Classic Cinema,,2023-10-07 23:20:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/307666878_3398793493736207_6232468325560033903_n.jpg?stp=c43.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=uz071nlKv9AAX80Pq60&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAd7V30OrWSuZhs4X-tdLri0iqH9hD1iVGGBgW9u3Vong&oe=6559C0FF,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1815772135418393/permalink/3578276942501228,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386771854_10227146518546757_4956670577561892578_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=0V0IIGL3YfIAX-Giilx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAqg4C48fVFUJYFsc2M-iaPPuOaXdW_SB4YS882A2hpUw&oe=652670BF

facebook,"STATEMENT OF SPEAKER FERDINAND MARTIN ROMUALDEZ ON THE ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT Today, I join voices from around the world in strongly condemning the heartbreaking attacks against innocent civilians in Israel. The devastation and loss suffered by families during such significant moments of reverence are beyond words. It is a reminder that the path of violence only deepens wounds and rifts. I urge all involved parties, especially the militant rulers of Hamas, to pave a way toward a peaceful resolution. The history of this region has seen enough bloodshed; sustainable peace is the only way forward. To our Filipino brothers and sisters living or working in Israel, my thoughts are with you. The Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Migrant Workers (DMW), and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) are now working overtime to ensure your safety and well-being. Please remain vigilant and prioritize your safety during these turbulent times. Your welfare is a matter of paramount importance to us. I align myself with the sentiments of global leaders and advocates for peace, emphasizing that dialogue and understanding are paramount. True change can only be achieved when we respect and protect the rights of civilians, as stipulated under international law.

facebook,"Tessa home üéâüéâ Tessa raakte op 7 oktober 2023 vermist toen zij in conflict kwam met een andere hond. Hier schrok ze erg van en is weggerend. Dit gebeurde aan de Oostindie in Zevenhuizen. De dierenambulance en HZNN werden ingeschakeld en vrijwilligers gingen samen met de eigenaren op locatie. Er kwamen een aantal zichtmeldingen rondom- en in de buurt van Tjoelker benzinepomp in Leek. Later, bleek dit niet Tessa te zijn, maar een beagle. Toch werd er wel spoor gevonden, dus is er een kans dat Tessa hier ook geweest is. En, geeneens ver bij huis vandaan. Zou ze dan misschien teruglopen? In de vroege ochtend van 8 oktober kwam er een melding van Commissiebos dat ze daar liep en een tuin in is gelopen. Hier werd later die avond een voerplek gemaakt. En er werd gewandeld door de eigenaren om een vertrouwde geur richting huis te verspreiden. Op 9 oktober werd ze vastgelegd op een ringdoorbell aan de Oudestreek. Gelukkig eindelijk beeld van haar! Daarna kwam er een melding nabij het voetbalveld en werd er een mogelijke aanrijding gemeld bij de Oude Streek. Er werd gezocht en gespot en geflyerd, maar het bleef erg lang stil. Er waren zorgen om Tessa, ook omdat ze mogelijk aangereden zou zijn. Het eerste wat je dan wilt; beeld van haar dat ze niet gewond is. En daar hebben we vrij lang op moeten wachten‚Ä¶ Op 10 oktober na dagen spotten, zwoegen, zweten en tegelijkertijd kou vatten in de weilanden; kwam er een zichtmelding op de Veldweg. Vol goede moed gingen vrijwilligers met de eigenaren erheen, maar helaas bleek het de buurthond te zijn‚Ä¶ En weer door.. 11 oktober! Eindelijk! Een zichtmelding nabij de Kippenboer. Maar, zou het Tessa zijn? Vol goede hoop weer verder. Er werden livecamera‚Äôs extra geplaatst en er werd een kooi klaargezet op locatie. Verder werd er gespot van ‚Äòs morgens vroeg tot ‚Äòs avonds laat en deze buurt werd ook weer ge√Ønformeerd. Op 13 oktober volgde er nog een zichtmelding. Tessa zou gezien zijn in het bietenveld. Bij aankomst bleek ze helaas al weer weg te zijn. Toch weer een nieuwe plek om te spotten en te informeren. Ook bij het speuren van Henny met Kazz (die meerdere keren gespeurd hebben deze vermissing) bleek ze waarschijnlijk daar geweest te zijn. ‚ÄòS avonds heeft RTV Noord met een vrijwilliger een mooie oproep voor Tessa uitgezonden. Vervolgens zijn er camera‚Äôs geplaatst bij het bietenveld. En op 15 oktober in de vroege ochtend‚Ä¶.. kwam Tessa in beeld op de live-camera‚Äôs. Dus doorpakken nu‚Ä¶ De vangkooi werd geplaatst bij het bietenveld, extra camera‚Äôs erbij. Eerst een kat erbij en toen Tessa in beeld bij de kooi! Super! Daarna kwam ze die dag (15 oktober) op verschillende plekken in beeld. Met de Kokswijk als middenweg die haar van de een naar de andere kant bracht. Spotters namen hun posities in, ook om haar te beschermen mocht ze oversteken. Maar, een keer knipperen en Tessa was al overgestoken‚Ä¶ ze was gewoon simpelweg te snel om met open ogen te volgen. We zagen haar van camera naar camera, maar zo snel dat je alleen bij wijze van een stofwolk zag. Wel kwam ze rustig in het veld nog in beeld. Rollend in het veld. Een mooi en rustig beeld gezien door de eigenaar. Ze leek in orde en dat was in elk geval al heel mooi nieuws. Op den duur kwam er een regenboog over het bietenveld. Zou dit het mooie teken zijn dat aan het einde van de regenboog Tessa in de kooi zou zitten? En dat was zo‚Ä¶ binnen een uur na het mooie beeld van de dikke heldere regenboog over het veld. Viel het luik van de kooi met Tessa erin ü•∞ü•∞ Dank aan Ime, Rosa, Hiltje, Yme en familie voor het vertrouwen in dierenambulance Westerkwartier. Dank aan Henny met Kazz voor het speuren. Dank aan meneer Kruims voor alle medewerking bij de camera‚Äôs en vangkooi en ook alle andere landeigenaren/huizen waar camera‚Äôs, voerplekken mochten en beeld van toe is gestuurd. Dank aan de gehele wijde omgeving voor het opletten en doorgeven van meldingen. Dank aan alle anderen die op welke manier dan ook iets voor Tessa gedaan hebben. En ook in het bijzonder de bijna 24/7 inzet van de eigenaren die vrijwel overal altijd aanwezig waren. Update: Tessa is de vangkooi ingelopen. Verslag volgt üéâüéâ Update: Tessa wordt af en toe nog gezien. Graag niet benaderen, dan voelt ze zich opgejaagd en vlucht weg.

Lynch, ITF - International Transport Workers' Federation General Secretary Steve Cotton, and Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey. ""We couldn't have won the contract we did at UPS without unity,"" O'Brien said. ""Moving forward, we have to be united to take on the corporate bullies at UPS, Amazon, Delta, Anheuser-Busch, and others. The fight at UPS is never over. We are just getting started. Enforcing this contract at UPS is going to be key to organizing at Amazon."" ""We are in a historic moment with strikes across the labor movement. The days of avoiding conflict are over. We have to take on these challenges head-on,"" O'Brien added. ""We need to organize in our core industries and negotiate the best contracts for our members,"" Zuckerman said. ""That's what Sean and I have been focused on since we took office. We have good political leaders who have our backs and we need more of them. If politicians aren't with us and all working Americans, we vote them out. It's not complicated."" ""Twenty million transportation workers around the world know the Teamsters...The world stopped during the pandemic. Transportation workers didn't. We have to strive to improve workers' lives, but that's only possible with strong leadership and support from the rank-and-file,"" Cotton said. ""I am proud to be here standing alongside Sean O‚ÄôBrien, a leader from Massachusetts who now leads the national fight for the Teamsters. Sean never gives up fighting for working families.

facebook,"1908 Gustav Adolph Mossa : : Sapho. Mossa (1883 ‚Äì 1971) is considered today as the last French symbolist painter. His work, already recognized before the First World War, was then deliberately obscured by the artist himself. He lived all his life in Nice and devoted himself mainly to his role as curator of the city's Museum of Fine Arts, a position he took over from his father, the founding curator of this museum. His symbolist and sulphurous work was hidden, then rediscovered in the reserves after his death in 1971. Like Gustave Moreau, his symbolist work is haunted by references to literature. But unlike his contemporaries, Mossa innovates by placing these figures in his century, the Belle Epoque. In the meticulous details of his works, he develops a rich iconography of Art Nouveau: furniture, costumes, jewelry. Many aspects of Mossa's paintings of this period were also indictive of the decadent movement, with his references to Diabolism, depictions of lesbianism (such as his two paintings of Sappho),or an emphasis on violent, sadistic or morbid scenes. Women are omnipresent in his work, under the guise of the femme fatale, even phallic and castrating; she is angel and demon at the same time. Through his work, Mossa explores his own unconscious and depicts the perpetual conflict of life and death drives: Eros and Thanatos. Like F√©licien Rops, many of Mossa's works still appear provocative today.",,349,"{'like_count': 233, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 80044}",Klimt & Schiele - the Art of Secession and beyond,,2023-10-07 05:08:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/347247849_205677352321628_8537931581156525702_n.jpg?stp=c43.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fghPtkmA658AX_XX3jS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAz9G2cRMoITp7bDpLzcrMVHxXoYGqPCzcdlCY92USAPw&oe=655A598E,https://www.facebook.com/groups/368769667535223/permalink/982577059487811,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387199307_6610539735695375_7616605225881125488_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=IEeTLEECl80AX8Y5duV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBi45CgQGV9plxKC2tp9LiAC5H81tuKDkvlsj3_QTr5NA&oe=65258879

facebook,"STATEMENT ON ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT Today, I join voices from around the world in strongly condemning the heartbreaking attacks against innocent civilians in Israel. The devastation and loss suffered by families during such significant moments of reverence are beyond words. It is a reminder that the path of violence only deepens wounds and rifts. I urge all involved parties, especially the militant rulers of Hamas, to pave a way toward a peaceful resolution. The history of this region has seen enough bloodshed; sustainable peace is the only way forward. To our Filipino brothers and sisters living or working in Israel, my thoughts are with you. The Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Migrant Workers (DMW), and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) are now working overtime to ensure your safety and well-being. Please remain vigilant and prioritize your safety during these turbulent times. Your welfare is a matter of paramount importance to us. I align myself with the sentiments of global leaders and advocates for peace, emphasizing that dialogue and understanding are paramount.

facebook,"(SPOILER ALERT for Kingdom of Ruins EP 1) First impressions of EP 1 were just fantastic! A very strong and depressing (in a good way) start to a very promising series. The world building is great I my opinion. I loved how they mixed in magic with science and technology to create conflict between the human race and the witch race (the 'Gear Expansion Revolution' sounds very strikingly similar to our real world's ""Industrial Revolution"") with loads of depth (it's not all for backdrop which I love a lot here). Seeing modern buildings alongside medieval style structures was bizarre yet very cool in this regard. I love the factor that despite the revolution bringing some form of ""peace"" and ""prosperity"" to the world, human beings still wage war, terror, slavery and other horrible things on each other. That's human nature which no matter how many innovations in humankind's history, will never disappear so I like they included this realistic factor here. The plot and characters also started off very strong. Chloe and Adolis, despite appearing together with limited screen time were lovable to the very end. Chloe's death was horrific (kind of reminds of how in WW2, the Axis powers of Japan and Germany would kill off people of other races they deemed 'inferior' to them) and our girl didn't deserve to go out like that üò≠. The plot is sounding strikingly similar to ""Akame Ga Kill"" which is not a bad thing but I hope this one turns out more unique and fleshed out (and no, I don't have a problem with Adolis laying the entire Redia Empire to ruins alongside that trash of a 'king' and it's awful inhabitants). Lastly, the animation, visuals and sound design were all great throughout the episode. The voice acting was superb as well (specially when Adolis was in pain from disbelief seeing that happened to Chloe Infront of him). I hope this series continues being this strong in future episodes. So far, it has been a great beginning.",,290,"{'like_count': 126, 'comment_count': 45, 'num_users': 794186}",Anime Corner - Community Group,,2023-10-07 22:52:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/328702280_1845871352448567_4001445082636019168_n.png?stp=c36.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cZTJ5PZUj54AX83orVm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAEkBFB9E-xmZibcOMlDNtH-MGnPGSql5zDAIFKN1Ak3g&oe=655A00B9,https://www.facebook.com/groups/364274964788636/permalink/1032726764610116,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385877316_3555953111345235_4371550862537824112_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=9IwgbD6tlmUAX-JRkEb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCH-6_Fop12CcpaCgAg8OG9MLk0ApIpGtVEFD87dO3Jmg&oe=65276BDE

facebook,"HAPPY FEAST OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARYüôèüéâüéäüôè BACKGROUND This feast was established by Pope Pius V to commemorate the great victory of the Christian army against the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. All soldiers on the battlefield prayed the Rosary for three hours and the wind has shifted in their favor. They were able to defeat an army three times bigger, in one of the greatest naval victory in history. Pope Pius V named this the Feast of Our Lady of Victories, to be celebrated on October 7th. In 1573, Pope Gregory XIII changed the title of this memorial to Feast of the Holy Rosary. Pope Paul VI established the form that we celebrate this feast today, in 1969 under the name ‚ÄúOur Lady of the Rosary‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe celebration of this day invites all to mediate upon the mysteries of Christ, following the example of the Blessed Virgin Mary who was so singularly associated with the incarnation, passion and glorious resurrection of the Son of God.‚Äù Fragment from the Christian Prayer (Liturgy of the Hours) Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, praying for the conversion of sinners often said, ‚ÄúLove the Madonna and pray the rosary, for her rosary is the weapon against the evils of the world today.‚Äù PRAYER Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, in these times of such brazen impiety, show your power with the signs of your former victories.

facebook,"My book, Was It Even Abuse?, is written in four parts to support you in gaining clarity in keys areas of confusion and self-doubt after covert abuse. Part one explores keys questions we ask ourselves: *Was my relationship abusive? *Why didnt i just leave? *Do they do it on purpose? *Am I the abusive one? *Am I overreacting? Part two explores: *How the abuser builds tensions *The impact of acute incidents of abuse *The role of manipulation *The effects of trauma bonding *...And importantly, untangling your responses from being the cause of abuse to facilitate self-compassion and growth. Part three explores cognitive dissonance and: *Our strong attachment to their potential *Red flags, identifying abusive tendencies and reflections to empower yourself *How the relationship shifts from the dream to the reality *Why its hard to let go of the belief in their potential *Reducing inner conflict, remaining strong in your truth and staying centered in the reality. Part four explores: *Thoughts that keep us attached, why we develop them and how to shift towards thoughts that support personal growth. *Beliefs about love that can be harmful and lead to shame in abusive relationships... and how to shift towards beliefs that enrich us. *Building healthy relationships, including feeling safe, recognising discernment and triggers and cultivating a feeling of love.

Expressing your feelings was hard because they would deflect or ignore them completely. But that doesn't mean it's okay for you to be selfish, distant, and moody with others. If you want to have good relationships, you need to get yourself together because right now everything is unclear due to your lack of openness. There are barriers, emotional immaturity, and a need for you to clear away negative self talk. This is the time to face these problems directly so you can have healthier relationships in your life, not just with others but also within yourself. You need to reconnect and take care of yourself. Understand that certain recent actions toward someone may have consequences that you'll need to deal with. It could also be the other way around, but these people came into your life to test you and see if you would match their negative behavior or rise above it and grow in ways you never thought possible. The truth has been revealed about someone, and it's important for you to take responsibility where necessary. Remember that every action has a result, whether it's the result you wanted or not. Take the time to make a tough decision about whether to let someone stay in your life or distance yourself from them. But don‚Äôt play the back-and-forth game. Let them know where you stand, so they know where they stand. If this person is causing inner conflict and you don't feel they can be trusted, it's time to let them go. #channeledmessages #oraclereading",,273,"{'like_count': 77, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 33291}",12th House Star,,2023-10-07 19:52:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/401856774_729146809232471_1248543593851599839_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mtxS22ffU-YAX8SgH7d&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBIG6sX_xLGRooB1igGQ-7r8QmdbYwKXhHgXMUJZ7RfZg&oe=655A4B6A,https://www.facebook.com/100064114745511/posts/707073374773148,

facebook,"To be clear: This does not mean we let kids ""run wild"" with zero structure, boundaries, or guidance from a well-regulated adult. I'm not saying we don't step in and offer the appropriate support and values-based rules to help our children treat themselves and others with care and respect. What I am saying is the foundation for all of this starts with us. If we can't regulate ourselves in the heat of the moment or in the midst of conflict, how can we expect that of our kids? I have to remind myself of that all the time. It's SO hard. If it's hard for you, please know you're not alone. This is humbling work and some days it's really confusing and overwhelming.

facebook,"The Trial of our Faith In this time of trial we need to be encouraged and comforted by one another. The temptations of Satan are greater now than ever before, for he knows that his time is short and that very soon every case will be decided, either for life or for death. It is no time now to sink down beneath discouragement and trial; we must bear up under all our afflictions and trust wholly in the Almighty God of Jacob. The Lord has shown me that His grace is sufficient for all our trials; and although they are greater than ever before, yet if we trust wholly in God, we can overcome every temptation and through His grace come off victorious. If we overcome our trials and get victory over the temptations of Satan, then we endure the trial of our faith, which is more precious than gold, and are stronger and better prepared to meet the next. But if we sink down and give way to the temptations of Satan, we shall grow weaker and get no reward for the trial and shall not be so well prepared for the next. In this way we shall grow weaker and weaker, until we are led captive by Satan at his will. We must have on the whole armor of God and be ready at any moment for a conflict with the powers of darkness. When temptations and trials rush in upon us, let us go to God and agonize with Him in prayer.

facebook,"Occasionally people ask, ‚Äòhow can I let my child go to a parent who isn‚Äôt this, and does that, and it won‚Äôt be good for them ‚Ä¶.?‚Äô It‚Äôs the nightmare situation an alienated parent finds themselves in. Pressure is put on the child to leave, reject and ultimately be alienated from a parent they love and who loves them. How can we let them go? The story of Solomon describes how the loving parent lets go. I‚Äôve done many posts on letting go as it can be hard to understand, especially for others, and family courts. Why don‚Äôt we fight more? We do as much as we can. But there comes a time when it only harms the child more, so we let go. With love. It is our sacrifice because we love them. In the story of the two mothers in Kings (3:16-28), two women living in the same house gave birth to babies at the same time. One mother rolled over on her baby, smothering him, and he died. She swapped out babies and tried to convince her friend that the dead baby was hers. The true mother took the dispute to King Solomon who discovered the truth. The true mother was the one who wouldn‚Äôt agree to the baby being cut in half by sword. The alienating parent doesn‚Äôt care what harm they do, they thrive on conflict. We want what is best for our children. They want what is best for them. If only our family courts were as wise as Solomon. I‚Äôm not suggesting the sword test. But there should be many ways they can identify the loving parent from the alienating, manipulative, selfish and abusive parent. The loving parent wants the child to have more family, not less, and more love, not less. The loving parent lets go because they love unconditionally. #unconditionallove #rejectedparent #alienatedchild #parentalalienation #highconflictcoparenting #alienatedparent #parentalalienationawareness #parentalalienationischildabuse #custodybattle #traumahealing #traumabond #traumabonding #coercivecontrol #highconflictdivorce #charliemccready",,230,"{'like_count': 88, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 6386}",Empowering You To Overcome Parental Alienation Behaviors,,2023-10-07 11:10:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/360082093_7068703019810680_5411866649719286884_n.png?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mf8HpJA5obgAX9-BEOG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMjb8RPoXp92tezZj5D1uHIyHKBEy1GaeB_PZiF71t3A&oe=655B8E98,https://www.facebook.com/groups/3214325232164553/permalink/3493745667555840,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/382741973_7324573004223679_7622278121298625468_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=chMEGgFP6lAAX90JoJ0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAOt29-78alaCg4cg9EFowxFScZn-Wgs4H6i8m_jaJH3g&oe=65264AFF

facebook,"Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Feast: October 7 This feast was established by Pope St. Pius V in thanksgiving for the victory at Lepanto, 7 Oct 1571, which stopped the Turkish invasion of Europe. Importance: The word Rosary means ‚ÄúCrown of Roses,‚Äù and each prayer in the Rosary is considered a flower presented to Mary. It is called the ‚ÄúBreviary of the Common People‚Äù and the ‚ÄúPsalms of the Illiterate.‚Äù The prayers we repeat are Biblical and hence ‚Äúinspired,‚Äù and the mysteries we meditate upon are taken from the lives of Jesus and Mary. The ‚ÄúOur Father‚Äù is a prayer taught by Jesus Himself. The ‚ÄúHail Mary‚Äù is also rooted in the Scriptures. Its first half echoes the words of the Archangel Gabriel and those of Elizabeth, both addressed to Mary. The rest of our petition , ‚Äúpray for us, sinners, now and at the hour of our death‚Äù is added by the Church, seeking Mary‚Äôs intercession. The third prayer ‚Äî the ‚ÄúGlory be to the Father‚Äù ‚Äî ancient in its wording, surely reflects the unceasing prayer of adoration and praise found in the Book of Revelation. The various events in the lives of Jesus and Mary on which we meditate during the Rosary are expressions of the Paschal Mystery, that is, the Life, Death and Resurrection of Jesus, in which Mary shared. History: Prayer using rosary beads is as old as mankind. The Hindus in India used to recite the thousand names of their gods and goddesses and their ‚Äúmantra‚Äù prayers using multi-beaded rosaries, and their sages wear such rosaries around the neck, constantly rolling the beads in prayer. The Jews used beads to repeat the psalms, the Laws of Moses and the memorized sayings of the prophets. The Muslims use rosaries with a hundred beads for their prayer. In the ninth century, the Christian monks who recited the 150 psalms instructed the illiterate common people to recite the Our Father 150 times. It was in the eleventh century that the Europeans added the Hail Mary to the Our Father. In 1214, according to the legend, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Dominic Guzman and instructed him to pray the Rosary in a new form as an effective antidote against the Albigensian heresy. The Rosary devotion attained its present form around 1500 A.D. An additional boost to the Rosary devotion was given in 1917, when our Blessed Mother, in her sixth apparition to the three shepherd children, on the thirteenth of May, asked them to, ‚ÄúSay the Rosary every day‚Ä¶ Pray, pray a lot and offer sacrifices for sinners‚Ä¶ I am Our Lady of the Rosary.‚Äù The ‚ÄúFatima prayer‚Äù (O my Jesus forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell and bring all souls to Heaven, expecially those who are most in need of Your mercy), requested by Mary herself at Fatima (July 13, 1917), was added following the ‚ÄúGlory be‚Ä¶‚Äùn after the 1930 acceptance of the Bishop of the apparitions as genuine century. Pope St. John Paul II enriched the Rosary by adding the ‚ÄúLuminous Mysteries‚Äù Introductory Prayer to the Rosary - Saint Louis de Montfort (Sign of the Cross Prayer) I unite with all the Angels and Saints in Heaven, with all the just on earth, and with all the faithful here present. I unite with Thee, O my Jesus, in order to praise worthily Thy holy Mother, and to praise Thee in her and through her. I renounce all the distractions that I may have during this Rosary, which I wish to say with modesty, attention, and devotion, just as if it were to be the last of my life. We offer Thee, O most Holy Trinity, this Creed in honor of all the mysteries of our Faith; this Our Father, and these three Hail Marys in honor of the unity of Thy Essence and the Trinity of Thy Persons. We ask of Thee a lively faith, a firm hope, and an ardent charity. Amen. (I Believe‚Ä¶Our Father‚Ä¶ three Hail Marys) To the Queen of the Most Holy Rosary Queen of the most holy Rosary, in these times of such brazen impiety, manifest thy power with the signs of thine ancient victories, and from thy throne, whence thou dost dispense pardon and graces, mercifully regard the Church of thy Son, His Vicar on earth, and every order of clergy and laity, who are sore oppressed in the mighty conflict. Do thou, who art the powerful vanquisher of all heresies, hasten the hour of mercy, even though the hour of God's justice is every day provoked by the countless sins of men. For me who am the least of men, kneeling before thee in supplication, do thou obtain the grace I need to live righteously upon earth and to reign among the just in heaven, the while in company with all faithful Christians throughout the world, I salute thee and acclaim thee as Queen of the most holy Rosary. Queen of the most holy Rosary, pray for us!",,218,"{'like_count': 80, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 148220}",ShareCatholic,,2023-10-07 07:17:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/327217807_873451083966496_4546724402141020760_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=L7u0ZawKoRoAX8e4ewU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDN1W_W6fKOic5KjPTiv5DPrQGvTpdzY5FixyXMSmv4hw&oe=6559F14C,https://www.facebook.com/100064818065564/posts/722591519911444,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/384099078_722591493244780_1614133901674337982_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=hUE5YARDzVEAX_FMHu7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBUmRymaMCp2E6QJL5230_hdULfGnqSqGAynOOxJ6ayww&oe=6525E91F

facebook,"Noratus Cemetery, Armenia. Noratus cemetery is situated in the province of Gexarkunik, near the village of Noratus in Armenia. The site has been occupied since the Bronze Age, as attested by the megalithic fort near the village and other artefacts dating to the Bronze and Iron Age. The present-day village was founded in 1829. The cemetery of Noratus is the largest in the territory of Armenia after the cemetery of Julfa in the Nakhichevan Province that was destroyed between 1998 and 2006 during a conflict with a neighboring country. The cemetery has been used from as early as the Early Christian period up to the modern day, as is indicated by the remains the funerary stelae dating back to the sixth or seventh century, and tomb-stones of a more recent date. The cemetery of Noratus has a unique, extraordinary collection of khatchkars, containing more than 900 pieces from the ninth or tenth to the eighteenth centuries; the majority of the khatchkars were erected between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries. This type of cemetery is also called a ‚Äúkhatchkar-forest‚Äù. Most of the khatchkars are grouped, indicating the burial place of different families. There are also tiny graves or rectangular mausoleums carrying cross stones. Some of the khatchkars stand on pedestals, with some among them reaching a height of 1.5m. Many khatchkars were carved during the revival of the khatchkar tradition in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, bearing witness to oriental influences widespread in Armenian art during the rule of the Safavid Dynasty in Persia. Several tombstones in the cemetery depict carved scenes of banqueting and hunting. These could indicate the royal or noble affiliation of the owner or owners.",,215,"{'like_count': 167, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 570587}","Ancient Wonders of Archaeology, Art History & Architecture",,2023-10-07 10:46:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/259883617_1062848167902467_7210834203642982840_n.jpg?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=G_jEQwd6SecAX_vpPg3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC-dotGh7igiVHzNwgC7JpajBtWhulrCVL9L1yJ3E97hg&oe=6559D610,https://www.facebook.com/groups/197247260424491/permalink/2650900438392482,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385780054_7468470919846458_706965489970084433_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=iHVYnB8ojPEAX_nP3jI&_nc_oc=AQl-lJk6R3iwEHsPzstj6U11tT2zplOQNbReewQhafVj5oCJ4kKeBSg2kazM5joJ0NU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBpQ1sD_jrWBGw2t12vEqoYk3A3Hbtk_IlpIpzlN9LQJA&oe=652AEE0B

This additional area will increase our capacity for housing bears that are removed from the wild due to human conflict, and provide many new enrichment opportunities. With the funds raised, we have been able to make steady construction progress this season- most recently a convoy of 14 cement trucks helped us lay down the den roof/ base of the upper habitat. The funding from our annual appeal also helps us purchase food and enrichment for the animals, including live fish and materials to make things like a new firehose raft for the otters! We love having new and exciting ways to change up the daily routine of the animals. Pictured: 1 and 2: Ongoing construction to our new Bear Den building. 2.

In a statement signed by Yusuf Tuggar, minister of foreign affairs, the federal government called on both sides to exercise restraint and prioritise the safety of civilians. In the early hours of Saturday, the Hamas militant group infiltrated Israel from the Gaza strip, in what has been described as an unprecedented attack. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli prime minister, has since called the invasion an act of war. The Israeli death toll from the crisis has surpassed 100, per latest reports, with more than 200 killed in Israeli reprisal attacks in Gaza. ‚ÄúThe federal government of Nigeria is deeply concerned about the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in the early hours of Saturday, 7th October, 2023 and calls for de-escalation and ceasefire,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúThe cycle of violence and retaliation that the current escalation has assumed, only serves to perpetuate an unending cycle of pain and suffering for the civilian population that bear the brunt of every conflict. ‚ÄúWe are therefore calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue.‚Äù #israelpalestinewar",,212,"{'like_count': 57, 'comment_count': 92, 'num_users': 815730}",TheCable,,2023-10-07 20:02:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/341249021_537820741840858_8649596265813523831_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=POmXumOXhwAAX9wQ_TE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCVnKuwPnzLY-UsTjr6WUlUVHWyA8PHretIoH_NzNCiGg&oe=655B3FE6,https://www.facebook.com/100069189460128/posts/633210295661947,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387753912_633210225661954_3452041728106305870_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=bu8TWQv_bxQAX8Mev5G&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCiGjIEUthNDK9L8_tRUgrfuIQULAwpFj8i5bCJEsIdEg&oe=65292BD5

facebook,"Dhuoda: A 9th-Century Woman Who Wrote a Book: ""Liber Manualis"" or ""Handbook"" for her son William. One of the most fascinating documents of the early Middle Ages must be the book that Dhuoda (pronounced Doda), a Frankish noblewoman, wrote for her son, William; it was written between November 841 and February, 843. When Dhuoda started the book, William, who was then aged fourteen, had been given as a hostage by his father, Bernard of Septimania, to the eighteen-year-old Charles the Bald, after the Battle of Fontenoy in May 841. Dhuoda composed the Handbook so that William could carry and hold it in his hand, a manual in other words. The object of her book was to offer a mother‚Äôs advice to her son on how to survive in a dangerous world and to remind him of his duties both to his father, and to his king, and on his behaviour as a chaste Christian warrior. The background was the unsettled era when the Carolingian Empire was breaking up and the sons of Louis the Pious fought each other over their share of their father‚Äôs empire, bringing devastation and ruin to many in its wake. In common with so many people of the early Middle Ages, almost nothing is known of Dhuoda‚Äôs parentage or background, other than what can be gleaned from her book, though she does not mention her own family of origin at all. However, she tells us that ‚ÄúI was given in lawful marriage on 29th June, 824, to my Lord Bernard‚Äù[i] in the Imperial Chapel in Aachen. Given the status of the man she married Dhuoda herself would have come from one of the noble families of the Carolingian empire and I have seen a suggestion that her father may have been Sancho, Duke of Gascony, though this is speculation. Bernard of Septimania, Dhuoda‚Äôs husband, was a second cousin of Louis the Pious, both were great-grandsons of Charles Martel as Louis‚Äôs grandfather Pippin the Short was a brother of Aldana, Bernard‚Äôs grandmother. Bernard‚Äôs father was William of Gellone or William of Aquitaine, a saint since 1066, and a prominent character in the book ‚ÄúHoly Blood Holy Grail‚Äù. In 826 Bernard and Dhuoda took up residence in Uz√®s, now in the Gard d√©partement, in Southern France, but then one of the major towns of Septimania, on the Spanish Marches. This coincided with Bernard‚Äôs appointment as Count of Barcelona, by Louis the Pious. Dhuoda and Bernard's son William was born on 29th November 826. By 829 it is known that Bernard was at the Court in Aachen, as he had been appointed Chamberlain by Louis the Pious that year. Bernard was one of the most controversial members of the Imperial Court, his position as chamberlain brought him into more or less daily contact with the Empress Judith with whom he was accused of committing adultery and of engaging in magical practices. In 830 he was deprived of some of his counties and also of his office as Chamberlain. In 834, during the rebellion of Lothar, the eldest son of Louis the Pious, against his father, Bernard‚Äôs sister Gerberga, a nun, became a casualty of the conflict. Gerberga was captured by Lothar who accused her of plotting with Judith and Bernard and of engaging in magical practices with them. The chronicler, Thegan, Bishop of Trier tells us that ‚ÄúLothar tortured her for a long time‚Äù [ii] and the Annals of St Bertin tell us that ‚ÄúBernard‚Äôs sister was put in a barrel and drowned in the Sa√¥ne‚Äù like a witch [iii]. This execution of Bernard‚Äôs sister, Gerberga, obviously made a strong impression at the time as it is mentioned by most of the chroniclers of the era. Dhuoda had remained behind in Uz√®s since the birth of William but how long he stayed with her is not clear; he may have been brought up in the household of one of his father‚Äôs brothers, or even in the court at Aachen. That being alone and responsible for Uz√®s was not easy is made clear by Dhuoda in this passage from the Handbook: ‚ÄúI acknowledge that, to defend the interests of my lord and master Bernard, and so that my service to him might not weaken in the March and elsewhere --so that he not abandon you and me, as some men do--I know that I have gone greatly into debt. To respond to great necessities, I have frequently borrowed great sums, not only from Christians but also from Jews. To the extent that I have been able, I have repaid them. To the extent that I can in the future, I will always do so.‚Äù That Bernard returned to Dhuoda at least once is known as her second son was born on 22nd March 841. However, ‚ÄúThis child‚Ä¶ was still tiny and had not yet received the grace of baptism when Bernard, my lord and the father of you both, had the baby brought to him in Aquitaine in the company of Elefantus, Bishop of Uz√®s‚Ä¶.‚Äù And ‚ÄúAs for you, I have heard that your father, Bernard, has given you as a hostage to the lord king Charles‚Ä¶..‚Äù - following the Battle of Fontenoy in June 841. Dhuoda exhorts William to care for ‚Äúyour little brother, whose name I still do not know‚Ä¶..when the time has come that he has learned to speak and to read, show him this little volume (truncated)",,208,"{'like_count': 156, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 69034}",The History Geeks,,2023-10-07 05:00:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/335331013_203264262289377_6088399463352971607_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=pe9MAxt5SFsAX826I3I&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAjS9ui-ZRocJj2kx0e4Q6X9LpnDmZ0Y6G7JpqI4yrmAw&oe=6559D747,https://www.facebook.com/100068947955550/posts/630783315896595,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386786909_630502402591353_8396402979413461756_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=QPRHhVmnMd8AX8WSkUp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA5jpj53dHKRFJp1bWj6cGW9nNpi8R6PLYeYdefoh2O8A&oe=65267B0A

According to authorities a verbal disagreement between a security guard and an unidentified male escalated into gunshots being exchanged. The situation started from the now deceased male having a minor conflict with the cashier on duty about not having the proper identification to purchase tobacco products. He would return shortly and get into a verbal altercation with the armed security guard. Allegedly he pulled out a firearm and the two began to exchange gunfire. The security guard would fatally shoot and kill him.

facebook,"No matter how spiritually ‚Äúwoke‚Äù we may think we are, we still have deeper issues which can only be worked out within the context of relationship. Left alone, we settle into comfortable patterns that limit the range of our emotional awareness and personal expression. However, once we step out of our comfort zone and open up to others, previously unnoticed/denied aspects of ourselves begin to emerge. At first, they make waves in the calm waters of our hearts, evoking passion and excitement. But when we let them in deeply enough, it‚Äôs like stirring up a pool of still water - all the heavy and messy things which settled at the bottom of our awareness are forced to emerge to the surface. When our otherwise hard-to-reach issues get stirred up for us to look at, we have an opportunity to embrace these fragmented parts of ourselves, to become more integrated and whole. This is a blessing in disguise, albeit a challenging one. Intimate relationships demand a depth of intensity and vulnerability which is the fuel for both transcendent passion and crippling conflict. This is why many esoteric teachings point to the ‚Äúpolar couple/ twin flame‚Äù archetype as the most powerful of alchemical unions. Intimate relationships have the potential for astoundingly accelerated transformation. Whether that transformation leads to conscious evolution or unconscious sabotage depends entirely on each person‚Äôs individual state of Being. If you and your partner aren‚Äôt engaged in sincere, deep, holistic self-work, there can only be 2 outcomes for this kind of relationship. Either you and your partner will settle into a relatively comfortable but very limited relationship of matrix-based pleasures and pursuits where your dysfunctions harmonize, but leave little room for expansion of the soul‚Ä¶ OR‚Ä¶ the relationship will dissolve to make way for something greater in your life. This is the case with the vast majority of relationships in the world, which is why people are often so dissatisfied in relationships. However, if you and your partner are committed to nurture the healing alchemical fire within each other, the richness of this kind of relationship is extraordinary! ~Rebel Lion Artist: Unknown",,195,"{'like_count': 84, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 1743300}",The Soul Journey with Sarah Moussa,,2023-10-07 18:43:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/385912116_649989763994529_4768002770283484820_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tb3t90PTTz4AX_LCbIQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAQGggbFaood98jQrU6jSPZiqMwVfMqvmwy_4c6xhkiXg&oe=655A3B98,https://www.facebook.com/100069505335894/posts/652170913776414,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387765601_652170563776449_4038043155088566322_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=hImqVyUp78UAX8flcqt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAKNxG2r9Im2lly8KTbQwQ1vGcZJxg_M4mriamV7IVH_A&oe=6527491C

facebook,"HOLY AND DIVINE LOVE MESSAGES FROM THE PAST
(for us to reflect on today - October 6, 2023) 

April 19, 2009 
Heaven Speaks to the Heart of the World 
(specifically - the path the world is taking) 

Midnight Service at the United Hearts Field - Feast of Divine Mercy 

(This message was given in multiple parts over several days.) 

Jesus is here as He is in the Divine Mercy Image; there is a huge Flame behind Him. He says: ""I am your Jesus, born Incarnate. I come to you tonight from the Will of the Eternal Father Whose Flame of Love you see behind Me."" 

""My brothers and sisters, I come to you as your Merciful Jesus. Those who love Me understand My Mercy and My Love, which are one. These are the ones that allow My Mercy and My Love to shine through them into the world. These are the ones who understand the call of My Heart to repentance of each soul. I will refuse no one who turns to Me with a repentant heart."" 

""Today the foundation of a one-world government has been laid through the global economic collapse which Satan has orchestrated. As this unfolds, remember that your free will remains intact. No one can dictate the affections of your heart. Live always in Holy Love. Remain calm; be at peace. If your heart is steeped in love of God and love of neighbor, you are safe, for I am with you."" 

""Hope, indeed, springs eternal for those who place their trust in Me. See in all world events the coming of the Kingdom of the Divine Will of My Father. Believe in this Kingdom - the New Jerusalem - which is alive in hearts living in Holy Love."" 

""Those who have made hatred into a 'religion' will destroy themselves. They cannot succeed, for Truth will be victorious. Holy Love is the Heart of Truth. In truth I tell you, it is now the hour of decision. Take up the weapons of prayer and sacrifice as I call together My army ** against evil. My victims of love are the officers in this spiritual army. I tell you, the battle against evil must be won in hearts before it is won in the world."" 

""During these decisive and difficult times, it is important to realize that conflict and wars arise in hearts because of conflict with the Commandments of Love. God desires all of creation to be in harmony with His Divine Will. This is why He has created this apparition site and this Mission. The more that people accept and surrender to Holy Love, * the greater the graces poured out here. Therefore, with hearts that emulate Divine Mercy and Divine Love, make the Messages known."" 

""My Mercy will never be depleted, but the dawn of My Divine Justice is at hand. Satan seeks to destroy all that is good and loving, using people and nature to accomplish his goals. Depend on Divine Mercy and Divine Love to see you through the worst of times. From My Love and My Mercy flows My Provision."" 

""I invite you to realize that when the Holy Love in your heart is compromised, every virtue begins to erode. It is as if the roots of a great tree were Holy Love. The trunk would be humility; the blossoms on this great tree are the different virtues. The roots and the trunk (love and humility) must remain healthy for the whole tree to be healthy. In the spiritual life, Holy Love and Holy Humility feed and support all the other virtues. Therefore, if Holy Love erodes, faith and hope are weakened. If humility is compromised, the rest of the tree of virtues begins to wither."" 

""Within each soul is this mystical tree of virtue; it gives life or else it withers and dies. In society this tree of virtue is necessary towards world peace. If it is ignored and not watered with Holy Trust, the world around the tree suffers. This is what leads to lack of peace in hearts."" 

""You may wonder at My depiction of personal holiness as this tree of virtue. But I invite you to see that each soul's journey or growth in holiness affects the heart of the world, for the heart of the world is a composite of the hearts of all its citizenry. The tree of virtue in the heart of the world is drying up from lack of care. In its place is the tree of antipathy towards God and His Commandments. The roots of this tree are hatred; the trunk is arrogant pride; the blossoms are not blooms but rather spoiled fruit - each one opposing virtue. This tree is beginning to thrive, nourished by man's over-indulgent trust in himself - through self-love."" 

""With a compassionate heart for the spiritual crisis in the heart of the world, realize that the tree of virtue stretches heavenward towards perfection in God's Will. On the other hand, the tree of antipathy towards God suffers from neglect and lack of care and takes on a countenance of death. Unless the gardener notices this poor tree, it will face a grim future."" 

""This is why I have come here - to draw attention to the state of the heart of the world. My plea is urgent. Nourish your hearts with the food of virtue. Do not be motivated by self-love, but by love of God and neighbor. This is what will redirect the future of the world.

I earnestly urge all Muslims to engage in hajat prayer, recite the qunut nazilah supplication, and make dua for our Muslim brothers and sisters in Gaza. Let us also convene a 'Solidarity Gathering for al-Quds' as a strong protest against Israel's oppressive actions, which continue to infringe upon Palestinian territory.

facebook,"UPDATE: Kenya's President, William Ruto stand on the Israel-Palestine War.üëáüëá Kenya joins the rest of the world in solidarity with the State of Israel and unequivocally condemn terrorism and attacks on innocent civilians in the country. The people of Kenya and their government hereby express deepest sympathy and send condolences to the families of all victims. We also wish a speedy recovery to the injured. Kenya strongly maintains that there exists no justification whatsoever for terrorism, which constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. All acts of terrorism and violent extremism are abhorrent, criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of the perpetrator, or their motivations. The international community must mobilise to bring the perpetrators, organizers, financiers, sponsors, supporters and enablers of these reprehensible criminal acts of terrorism to account and speedily bring them to justice. In consideration of the complex and delicate context of the security situation in Israel-Palestine, Kenya also makes a call for the de-escalation of violence and urges all parties to restrain from further military action, given its potential to intensify carnage and the suffering of innocent civilians, and to trigger heightened tension in the region and beyond. We are profoundly disturbed that civilians continue to be intentionally targeted in this conflict, as a consequence of which the number of casualties continues to rise. We therefore call on all parties to respect the rights of civilians and honour their obligations under international law. Finally, we take this opportunity to reiterate our firm stand in solidarity with all those calling on the parties to desist from further attacks, promptly effect cease-fire and embark on a path towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.",,187,"{'like_count': 148, 'comment_count': 36, 'num_users': 404712}",Marigiri,,2023-10-07 19:01:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/336660708_614611084015555_722021476849694268_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=pE7fts5lpGEAX-wwQUE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDRt5ghOYzfLB0P9rkiFkfHM2W0kmRiWdWlneFLu1YL7Q&oe=655ABDE7,https://www.facebook.com/100053194428568/posts/842531487529991,

facebook,"Een zwarte dag. Het Isra√´lische leger kondigde zopas aan dat het merendeel van de gebieden die Hamas deze morgen veroverd heeft, alweer onder Isra√´lische controle zijn. Het spreekt voor zich dat extreemrechts premier Benjamin Netanyahu deze aanval gaat gebruiken om de civil society in Isra√´l verder monddood te maken. Iedereen die ook maar in de verste verte publiekelijk durft te suggereren dat er een vreedzame oplossing moet komen voor de decennialange onderdrukking van Palestijnen, wordt zo een sociale paria en op termijn wellicht zelfs een vijand van de staat. Isra√´l zal verder afglijden van een democratie naar een totalitaire staat en volgt zo een globale tendens. Vrede verliest. Het resultaat zien we vandaag: grootschalige militaire aanvallen op burgerwijken in Palestina. Want elke Israeli√´r heeft de beelden gezien van dode, naakte burgers die schaamteloos werden vernederd en vermoord door Hamasstrijders. Wat ze niet te zien krijgen, zijn de resultaten van de bombardementen die hun eigen leger al jarenlang uitvoert. Netanyahu kan nu teren op de angst en kwaadheid van zijn burgers; de Palestijnen moeten en zullen lijden. Intussen stookt Hamas de woede en de frustratie van Palestijnen verder op. Want vergis u niet: Hamas handelt niet in het belang van Palestina noch in het belang van de Palestijnen. Hamas handelt in het belang van Hamas, de Hezbollah in Libanon en de Iranese dictatuur. De Palestijnen hebben baat bij vreedzaam verzet, internationale steun en het einde van een apartheidsstaat. Want Palestijnen worden al decennialang onderdrukt. Hamas heeft baat bij conflict, radicalisatie en een open oorlog. Op die manier zijn beelden van onschuldige burgerslachtoffers een win-win voor zowel Hamas als voor Netanyahu. Zij willen conflict. Zij willen een oorlog. En alle burgers, ongeacht hun ethniciteit of geloof, die in vrede proberen samen te leven, zijn hier het slachtoffer van. Een duurzaam vredesbestand is nu verder weg dan ooit. #AllemaalVanBelang",,182,"{'like_count': 44, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 13784}",Allemaal Van Belang,,2023-10-07 19:15:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/307318528_449999747165690_1923128172835119419_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GYL1jxIW7vUAX_axay2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBGAIlEyCpsHuVSLmEyNgrHcV8tt8TQBE2HwbNU-qFPOQ&oe=6559D217,https://www.facebook.com/100064670056830/posts/690468763118786,

facebook,"CMJ Friends & Supporters: We are asking that you stand with us in prayer! This weekend should have marked the launch of our end of year fundraising campaign. However, in light of what is happening in Israel, we are setting that aside, and asking for intercession for the Land of Israel. You may already have read news feeds announcing rocket fire and military skirmishes in Israel between Hamas soldiers, local police, and the Israel Defense Force. It is impossible to determine at this time how serious or prolonged this season of conflict will be. As you are probably aware, this is different from past rounds of the conflict in that the terrorists from Gaza have infiltrated Israeli towns and settlements in the south. This time as far as we can tell, the region stands at a watershed moment. We will issue regular prayer alerts as new needs become clear. A leading newspaper in Israel published the following, only minutes ago: There have been terrible massacres in some communities and military bases. Although thousands of rockets and missiles have been fired into Israel, from the south to Jerusalem and the greater Tel Aviv area, that has been mainly a diversion: Hamas' military effort is concentrated on the Israeli communities on the Gaza border. Tragically, it has been very successful. First, a couple of reminders. Nothing occurs outside the providence of the Father. So pray in hope for all of His disciples here in Israel and Gaza. Be aware that these troubles are accompanied by digital misinformation. So, caution is required. As of the sending of this email, the situation on the ground is as follows: 1. Rocket fire continues to land in Israel. Over 3000 rockets have been fired in the last ten hours. 2. There are over 1000 wounded and over 100 dead. The likely number could be hundreds more. 3. Israeli security services report that there are still 20 locations of ongoing fighting with Hamas militants within Israeli territory. 4. The IDF has confirmed that hostages have been taken. Numbers are unconfirmed but could be between dozens to over a hundred. Key things to pray for right now are: 1. For all those who have been injured by rocket fire or terrorist gunfire. 2. For those who have been kidnapped 3. That the officials in Israel who will decide how to respond, will be graced with the wisdom of the Lord whether or not they ask for it. 4. For the perseverance and calm of our staff as we serve our guests and pilgrims who are often quite frightened. For their safe passage home and for local people who may be needing help as well. 5. Pray for the upcoming groups scheduled to come - for wisdom in how to proceed. 6. That the Lord gives our leadership wisdom in the decisions we will need to make in the coming days. 7. Especially intercede for members of our staff, young men from our communities who are part of response teams serving as soldiers or medics in harm‚Äôs way. Pray for members of our congregations that have either been called up themselves or have children and grandchildren that are serving in the military and emergency services. 8. Pray for the residents of Gaza. Through our online ministry in Arabic, we are getting messages from people that we are working with and discipling who are frightened and equally fearful for their lives. There is much for which to pray. However, above all, please pray for God's sovereignty in these difficult times. May His kingdom come, and may His will be done. Thank you for your partnership of prayer in our calling. - CMJ Israel Staff If you want to know how you can either pray and help further, please email us at office@cmj-israel.org",,177,"{'like_count': 22, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 14581}",CMJ Israel,,2023-10-07 16:30:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/327427286_1219835755312686_4667009618926991635_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ObHZvvF-4uAAX_peQVH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDOjr3CzZl0xOJezDzMxbl_P-7O0IwEf1nMWWCQqJouIw&oe=6559B05D,https://www.facebook.com/100064383145720/posts/700083232147775,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387105378_700082225481209_4214671612000962139_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EYh2hsnXKrQAX_tWbGx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBfPLQ9wYNpmoBcK_ckXPimjkvJjL2zl4kuC1y9H4kRzA&oe=655A2266
facebook,"At least 100 people have died in Israel after Palestinian militant group, Hamas launched its biggest attack in years Militants crossed into Israel from Gaza under the cover of heavy rocket fire. The BBC Reports that Israel has responded with a wave of air strikes on targets in Gaza killing 198 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is ""at war"" and vowed that Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, will ""pay a price it has never known"". This is one of the most serious escalations in the Israel-Palestinian conflict in years. The attack by Hamas saw fighters cross the perimeter fence at just after dawn. At the same time, barrages of rockets were launched from Gaza - some reaching as far as the cities of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. It is not clear yet how the gunmen managed to penetrate one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world. The Israeli military has said dozens of fighter jets are carrying out air strikes on Hamas sites in Gaza, and it has hit 17 Hamas military compounds.

PRAYER:
O Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, in these times of such brazen impiety, manifest thy power with the signs of thine ancient victories. From thy throne whence thou dispense pardon and grace, mercifully regard the Church of thy Son. His Vicar on Earth, and every order of clergy, religious, and laity, who are oppressed in this mighty conflict. Thou who art powerful, the vanquisher of all heresies, hasten the hour of mercy, even though the hour of God's justice is every day provoked by the countless sins of men, the sons and daughters of Adam. Obtain for me, the least of men, kneeling before thee in supplication, the grace I need to live righteously upon earth, in order to be numbered among the just in heaven. In the company of all faithful Christians throughout the world, I salute thee and acclaim thee as Queen of the Most Holy Rosary. Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, pray for us. Amen.

facebook,"HAPPY FEAST OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARYüôèüéâüéäüôè BACKGROUND This feast was established by Pope Pius V to commemorate the great victory of the Christian army against the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. All soldiers on the battlefield prayed the Rosary for three hours and the wind has shifted in their favor. They were able to defeat an army three times bigger, in one of the greatest naval victory in history. Pope Pius V named this the Feast of Our Lady of Victories, to be celebrated on October 7th. In 1573, Pope Gregory XIII changed the title of this memorial to Feast of the Holy Rosary. Pope Paul VI established the form that we celebrate this feast today, in 1969 under the name ‚ÄúOur Lady of the Rosary‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe celebration of this day invites all to mediate upon the mysteries of Christ, following the example of the Blessed Virgin Mary who was so singularly associated with the incarnation, passion and glorious resurrection of the Son of God.‚Äù Fragment from the Christian Prayer (Liturgy of the Hours) Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, praying for the conversion of sinners often said, ‚ÄúLove the Madonna and pray the rosary, for her rosary is the weapon against the evils of the world today.‚Äù PRAYER Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, in these times of such brazen impiety, show your power with the signs of your former victories. Look with mercy on the Church of your Son, on His Vicar on earth, and on all the clergy and laity, who are sorely oppressed in this mighty conflict. Powerful vanquisher of all heresies, hasten the hour of mercy even though the hour of God‚Äôs justice is every day provoked by the countless sins of men. As I kneel before you in prayer, obtain for me my requests (Mention your request here‚Ä¶) Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, pray for us.",,169,"{'like_count': 69, 'comment_count': 47, 'num_users': 183857}",LOVE THE CATHOLIC PRAYER GROUP,,2023-10-07 00:03:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/84752234_1190709351134529_8657822039081484288_n.jpg?stp=c23.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=yv9_xnd09ecAX9qiy3j&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDVhLrdiMb0sPadyl3rNVQuQ-Vjyzhc2OhszpyouWQVyg&oe=657D097F,https://www.facebook.com/groups/277531275912627/permalink/2157212664611136,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/382602647_10226026794309529_8199361832077809988_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=udA2V9dVf-QAX-6fW6M&_nc_oc=AQmeqj9j8csh7hQ8IuqwOPhV-3CdeZ5tyUGDUhHeRLNvyjqolCabTTv0fkNKjgJBSDU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDNpt_RNyxxO4hGqHn_GmugFaO9uA6uVu1tMnNlqbx8ag&oe=6525A6A4

facebook,"THE THIRD WAY, OR HOW NOT TO CHOOSE SIDES IN A WAR When I wake up in the morning and hear about the attack on Israel from Gaza, I enter into a whirlwind of emotions. Feelings of rage, anger, sadness, judgement, failure, despair all come to the surface and get entangled into a knot in my stomach. The best - and the easiest, I guess - is to detach, like most westerners do. ‚ÄòOh, another fight between Israel and Hamas.‚Äô But I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm too much involved. And I don‚Äôt even understand why. ‚ÄòWhat do I have to do with this whole mess?‚Äô I ask myself in a failed attempt to escape the misery. But fate looks at me with a grim smile on its face. There is no escape, no way out. Just like there is no way out for the people of Israel and the people of Palestine. The poisonous cup must be emptied to the bottom. I think about the ‚ÄòMeditation for Peace‚Äô we did last week, during a gathering of Israeli Women Wage Peace and the Palestinian Women of the Sun. As a group of internationals we visualized us standing in a circle around them, not taking sides, just holding space. How must they feel now, after what happened? Who wants to be seen with the enemy these days? At best people will think of them as naive, at worst as being traitors to their own people. I also think about the friends I know on both sides: in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Gaza and kibbutz Be‚Äôeri, close to the Gaza border. They must be in a terrible place, with so much fear and sadness and hatred going on. They probably go through the same rollercoaster as I experience, or even worse. I even wonder if they are still alive. Only when listening to some beautiful music I start to cry and let my grief out. I get in touch with all the pain and suffering, including my own. Afterwards I feel more relieved. Underneath the sadness I have a deeper realization: Yes, I am involved, and I have to take my place, even if I‚Äôm an outsider, even if I am scared, even if I make mistakes. Because when I read the different newssites I only read opinions and quotes of leaders that make everything worse then it already is. Everyone seems the need to take sides, to judge - just like I did - to blame, to become angry, to become enraged and to add to the split that is already there. The attack on Israel ignites a worldwide indignation in most western countries. ‚ÄòIsrael has the right to defend itself against terrorists,‚Äô all political leaders sing in choir. But during the many attacks on the Westbank and Gaza over the last few months there was the same indignation in Muslim countries: why is nobody calling justice for the people being killed or chased by settlers or the Israeli raids?‚Äô they say. We are all swept away in a tsunami of ‚Äòus versus them‚Äô, of right versus wrong, of the good guys versus the bad guys. How can we stay in the middle of the hurricane of emotions and not be caught in the merry-go-round of action and reaction, of victims and perpetrators, of anger and blame, of killing and revenge? How to not choose sides in a war? And yet, how to speak your truth and bring clarity in a conflict that seems to be the conflict of all conflicts, the war of all wars? ‚ÄòIf there is peace in Jerusalem, there will be peace in the world.‚Äô But up till now it is just a bloody mess that is only getting worse. So how to get out of the quackmire? What helps us in a conflict that seems endless and hopeless? Are there any guidelines that can give us directions? In the last 20 years that I got involved in this story and gave many workshops of traumahealing to both Israelians and Palestinians - I learned a couple of things which I would like to bring to the table, in an effort to bring some clarity. 1. There are two ways out of pain: one is to blame others, to fight, to inflict pain on someone else, to judge, to start a war and kill the one that seems the cause of your pain. The other way is to go inside, to feel the pain, to cry and grief, and to learn to stay with it. The way out versus the way in. The first leads to more pain, more hatred, more duality, more chaos; the second leads to integration, wisdom, healing, and compassion. The first way is the most easy, the second way is the road less traveled, and definitely harder to choose. 2. Where women will sooner tend to choose the second way, men mostly choose the first way out: sadly but true, it is the mostly men who wage war, build walls, fight the enemy and ready to kill the ‚Äòother‚Äô. We, as men, haven‚Äôt learned the inner path; the path of grieving, crying, holding space, embracing, connecting and healing. It is being deemed unmanly, soft, feminine, weak. We need to be strong, powerful, the winner, the protector. It is probably this false image of masculinity that keeps us being trapped in the endless cycle of violence. It is no coincidence that the group of women that wants to stop the war are called ‚ÄòWomen Wage Peace.‚Äô Because Men Wage War. 3. If masculinity is part of the problem, then it is also part of the solution. For men it is difficult (truncated)",,165,"{'like_count': 16, 'comment_count': 12, 'num_users': 8216}",GATHERING OF THE TRIBE,,2023-10-07 18:40:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/332878253_753867822834695_2567862586200537926_n.png?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=WfCvICGZ-DoAX80h7Fc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCqJPKlCE5M8TN17FxW_Shp0leabX5qAJ1o1gN3Ll2u5A&oe=655A0463,https://www.facebook.com/groups/398033534942122/permalink/852265549518916,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387214970_7404293932919510_3900315021844662575_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=GCF3B7kaZtMAX_79-uL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC3T7XCkbzfTsswgXNrkK8inWY78Q1b_8z0pJ8LkN4HBw&oe=6525F1D5

facebook,"Media Statement 07 October 2023. South Africa calls for the immediate cessation of violence, restraint, and peace between Israel and Palestine South Africa expresses its grave concern over the recent devastating escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The new conflagration has arisen from the continued illegal occupation of Palestine land, continued settlement expansion, desecration of the Al Aqsa mosque and Christian holy sites, and ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people. The region is in desperate need of a credible peace process that delivers on the calls of a plethora of previous UN resolutions for a two-state solution and a just and comprehensive peace between Israel and Palestine. South Africa, working together with the international community, seeks to ensure a lasting and durable peace that produces a viable, contiguous Palestinian State, existing side-by-side in peace with Israel, within the 1967 internationally recognised borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. UN resolutions and international law matter. The international community can not avoid its duty to act, and together, we must shoulder the responsibility to remove obstacles to peace and any violations of international law. Violence, killings, imprisonment, forced removals, illegal settlements, and the continued siege of Gaza are not conducive to resolving the conflict. Urgent attention must be given to resolving the final status issues such as borders, the status of Jerusalem, the release of political prisoners, and the right of return. No real and lasting peace in Israel, Palestine, and the region is possible in the absence of a just and comprehensive resolution of the conflict. Israelis, Palestinians, and the region do not stand to gain anything from escalated tensions, increased violence, growing instability, and a continued and protracted violent conflict. South Africa therefore calls on all sides to seize the opportunity for peace as opposed to violence, and for the international community to actively rise on the side of its own International resolutions and establish a credible peace process. South Africa stands ready to share its experience in mediation and conflict resolution as it has done on the continent and around the world.

facebook,"What's for breakfast today? Do a fact check of your diet and lifestyle. Non communicable diseases in Malaysia is so high. 1 in 5 live with diabetes, 1 in 3 with hypertension, and 50% are obese. Chronic kidney disease is at almost 16%. In Malaysia, more than two out of 10 children below five years of age are stunted (short). At 21.8%, Malaysia's child stunting rate is higher than in lower middle-income countries like Ghana (17.5%) and even conflict-ridden areas such as Palestine (7.4%) and Iraq (12.6%). To me all these is due to very poor nutrition literacy, diet habits and lifestyle. I see people heaping their plates with food (esp rice) at weddings; people eating out everyday even till midnight; parents giving money to children to buy Grab food as an easy way out. Look around yourself and see how many people are overweight. Overweight people are celebrated as confident and slaying because no one dares to tell their friends, he/she needs to do something about their weight. A country/society with all these issues will not be seen as a first world country/society. What we can do: 1. Reduce rice, wheat and all carbohydrates 2. Get involved in healthy outdoor activities - hiking, sports, workouts, etc 3. Stop eating out. Make it a luxury for special days 4. Learn about nutrition, diet 5. Start with your children. Give them only small portion of rice/carb. NO unhealthy snacks 6. Stop eating when you still feel like you need more. 7. Make your food your medicine NOT disease maker 8. NO to all carbonated drinks or cordial and teh tarik made using condensed milk 9. Roti canai should be a monthly affair and not more than 1 piece 10. Eat more protein, good fat, vege and fruits 11.

facebook,"Why is the FEAST of the OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY, on every October 7th? 
..... The story of the  VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY at the Battle of Lepanto, on OCTOBER  7, 1571.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
IN TIMES OF ACUTE DANGER AND HARDSHIP, WE MUST ALWAYS FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD AND TURN TO THE RECITATION OF HER HOLY ROSARY. The Battle of Lepanto is a great lesson of confidence for us today. 

When Saint Pius V became Pope, Christendom faced the perils perhaps unequaled in its history of continual conflict with the violent followers of Mohammed. All the information and intelligence that Pope Pius V had been gathering indicated that the Ottoman juggernaut was about to roll across the Mediterranean and adjacent lands, spearheaded by the Turkish fleet, with Italy and Rome as one of its target. (The Ottoman Empire is also historically known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire)

Only Spain and Venice had the resources to resist, and they hated each other along with deep mistrust. Yet Saint Pius ‚Äî calling down divine grace as only a man of prayer could ‚Äî forged an alliance with them as the core of an organized fleet of over 200 galleys. With his considerable tact and diplomatic skills, he not only kept them unified, but he convinced them to attack the enveloping menace.

The Archbishop of Mexico had an exact copy of the HOLY IMAGE OF THE LADY OF GUADALUPE sent to King Philip II, who in turn gave it to Andrea Doria, one of the three principal admirals of the fleet, who placed it in his cabin. When the Armada went from file to line abreast and attacked on the morning of OCTOBER 7, 1571 the blue standard of OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE was also flying from the masthead of Don Juan‚Äôs flagship. 

Pope Pius V, a Dominican prelate before becoming a Pope, did what Catholics have always done in times of acute danger: FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD. As a follower of Saint Dominic, HE KNEW THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF IMPLORING HER HELP WAS THROUGH THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY. He ordered all monasteries and convents in Rome to increase their prayers for the impending battle and organized ROSARY PROCESSIONS in which he, as sick as he was, participated. OUR LADY‚ÄôS PRESENCE THAT DAY WAS MORE ACUTELY FELT THROUGH THE HOLY ROSARY.

As the Christian fleet sailed toward the great clash, MASS WAS CELEBRATED AND THE ROSARY RECITED DAILY ON EACH VESSEL‚Ä¶.. THIS HEARTFELT REQUEST FOR DIVINE ASSISTANCE RESULTED IN A CRUSHING DEFEAT OF THE OTTOMANS AT LEPANTO THAT ENDED THEIR DOMINANCE AND CRUELTY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. OCTOBER 7, 1571, WAS THE VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY, EVEN IF THE CHRISTIAN FLEET WAS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE OTTOMAN FLEET.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
TO CELEBRATE OUR LADY‚ÄôS INTERCESSION AND VICTORY, THE CHURCH HAS DESIGNATED OCTOBER 7 AS THE FEAST OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY. Similar acknowledgement to the Blessed Virgin‚Äôs intercession through the Rosary were made when John Sobieski forced the Turks to lift the Siege of Vienna in 1683 and after the victory of Prince Eugene of Savoy at Temesvar in his successful campaign to remove the Ottomans from Europe in the next century.

Israel‚Äôs prime minister has declared that the country is at war. ‚ÄúThe World Council of Churches appeals urgently for an immediate cessation of this deadly violence, for Hamas to cease their attacks and ask both parties for de-escalation of the situation,‚Äù said WCC general secretary Rev. Prof. Dr Jerry Pillay. ‚ÄúWe are deeply concerned about the imminent risks of spiralling conflict between Israel and Palestinian armed groups, and of the inevitably tragic consequences for the people of the region ‚Äì Israelis and Palestinians alike ‚Äì following a period of escalating tensions and violence in the West Bank and Jerusalem.‚Äù WCC general secretary Rev.

facebook,"TOO LATE FOR THE LATE LATE? The Late Late Show is not a comedy show but its host, Patrick Kielty is and turns it into one. Another disastrous production last night, which for the most part was a cringe to watch and as spectacular as a damp firework. It wasn't even live but recorded midweek. The host is unsuitable and out of place, the set is for a dedicated theatrical performance, the gusts by and large are dull and made awkward by Kielty's inapt position and the topics are at best superficial and irrelevant. The whole atmosphere is mimicking a cheap U.S. daytime TV show, with button laughter and audiences which behave like they've just stumbled through the door from a late-night drinking binge. Tensions are said to be rising behind the scenes over the poor ratings, with at least one producer, Jane Murphy, quitting after disagreements. Kielty himself is said to be difficult to work with and hypersensitive. The Late Late Show needs a competent and suitable host, male or female, old or young, known or new, but Patrick Kielty is not the man for the job. The show will always be only a poor reflection of what made it an institution and envied the world over if it stays on its present course. WAR BY PROXY The news today of the spiralling conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip is very serious. Confrontation and injustices have been continual in this part of the word for quite literally thousands of years, much faith based. The history of the Palestinians and Jewish people is very long and tragic. The wider strategic game is very much at play and can partly explain the latest flare up. Israel and Saudi Arabia are on the brink of a dramatic breakthrough in positive relations which could change the dynamic of the Middle East and bring impetus to Israelis and Palestinians to the table where real concessions from both sides could happen. Saudi Arabia has already indicated this would allow them to invest huge monies into the project. However, this situation does not play well for Iran, whose is the arch enemy of Saudi Arabia and seek to outdo them as the main regional power. In addition, Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons and have accused Israel of organising sabotage against this program. A conflict on Israel's territory would deflect them from such activities for a time at least. The conflict would also benefit Iran's fellow traveller and ally, Putin. The 5,000 rockets launched at Israel in the last 12 hours have been supplied from Iran. The training, weaponry and logistics have come from Iran. This is in effect an attack on Israel by proxy using Palestinians but from Iran. That is where the escalation to an even more horrific situation is presently going.

facebook,"St George's Plateau, 1930 and 2023 Original photograph by Edward Chambre Hardman From Wikipedia Liverpool Cenotaph stands on St George's Plateau, to the east of St George's Hall in Liverpool, England. It was erected as a memorial to those who had fallen in the First World War. The dates of the Second World War were subsequently added. The cenotaph consists of a rectangular block of stone on a stone platform, with bronze, low-relief sculptures on the sides depicting marching troops and mourners. It was designed by Lionel Budden, with carving by Herbert Tyson Smith. Initially designated as a Grade II listed building, its status was raised to Grade I in 2013. History In 1926, a competition was held to create a memorial using public funds, with Charles Reilly, professor of architecture at the University of Liverpool, as assessor. There were 257 entrants; the winning, anonymised entry was by Reilly's assistant, Lionel Budden. The building contractors appointed were A. E. Bradley and Company, the sculptor was Herbert Tyson Smith, and his bronze sculptures were made at the foundry of the Morris-Singer Company. The cenotaph was unveiled at 11 am on 11 November 1930 by the 17th Earl of Derby. Following the end of the Second World War, the dates 1939 and 1945 were added. These were unveiled on Remembrance Sunday, 10 November 1946, by William G. Gregson, Lord Mayor of Liverpool. Description The cenotaph consists of a rectangular block of Stancliffe stone, with bronze relief statues on the sides, standing on a platform of Yorkshire Silex stone. The rectangular block is 35 feet (10.7 m) long and 11 feet (3.4 m) high, the length of the bronze panels is 31 feet (9.4 m), and the platform is 61 feet (18.6 m) long and 15 feet (4.6 m) deep. It is orientated northeast‚Äìsouthwest, in parallel with St George's Hall. The bronze relief on the northwest face, opposite the hall, depicts a stream of marching troops in the uniforms of the various armed forces. Above the panel is an inscription reading AS UNKNOWN AND YET WELL KNOWN AS DYING AND BEHOLD WE LIVE, and below, the inscription reads OUT OF THE NORTH PARTS A GREAT COMPANY AND A MIGHTY ARMY. On the southeast face, facing Lime Street station, the panel depicts mourners laying flowers and wreaths on a Stone of Remembrance, with rows of graves in a military cemetery behind them. Above the panel the inscription reads TO THE MEN OF LIVERPOOL WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR with an added inscription below it reads AND ALL WHO HAVE FALLEN IN CONFLICT SINCE. Under the panel is an inscription reading AND THE VICTORY THAT DAY WAS TURNED INTO MOURNING UNTO ALL THE PEOPLE. On the shorter northeast and southwest faces are circular bronze shields with the coat of arms of Liverpool and festoons, and the dates of the two wars. Appraisal Detail from bronze sculpture depicting mourners laying wreaths on the Stone of Remembrance The cenotaph was designated as a Grade II listed building on 28 June 1952. On 8 November 2013, the designation was raised to Grade I. The reasons given for the designation include its design context with its ""impressive location"" adjacent to St George's Hall. Also noted is the architectural interest of the cenotaph, with its horizontal lines forming a foil to the vertical columns of the hall. Referring to its sculptural interest, the citation states that the ""sculptural work is exceptional and is arguably Tyson Smith's finest and most powerful work"". The design is considered to have contemporary significance in that rather than using ""allegory and heroic idealisation"", it employs ""powerful and modern realist portrayals"". The quality of its craftsmanship is praised, and it is also to have group value in its location near other listed buildings. In the Pevsner Architectural Guides, Sharples expresses the opinion that ""it is one of the most remarkable war memorials in the country"".",,147,"{'like_count': 124, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 104749}",Liverpool: Then and Now,,2023-10-07 17:37:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/307959837_191313986620748_1506966289607228189_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=n-SqmDS3hRAAX9WGMh_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAT1KJFbWiUX_gMJoFp4ZUKkWX7bYOblInFLZUVqwB3Wg&oe=655A2E25,https://www.facebook.com/100072264422291/posts/338772361874909,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387858156_338771371875008_1806997159979588154_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yb9dByO8Mj8AX-PzIHn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBPHOXHP90RpN7rQ9CjeulL_Xik0DQ9OepMyaCvBjNZxA&oe=65456A98

facebook,"I stand firmly with Israel and unequivocally affirm its right to defend itself and its people. I am confident President Joe Biden will act with purpose to assist the Israeli government, and I urge the Administration to move quickly. As a Marine veteran of Iraq, I know firsthand how challenging it is to conduct effective counterinsurgency operations, acting swiftly to neutralize immediate threats while avoiding levels of escalation that will simply recruit more terrorists to the cause in the future. The world must figure out how to empower the peacemakers in this generations-long conflict. Hamas‚Äôs actions to define the conflict today are evil, their tactics are criminal, and the future they paint is dark. I return to the Israeli kids I met near Gaza, as well as Palestinian kids I've met at schools in the West Bank.

Cu toate acestea, Bucure»ôtiul »ôi Kievul √ÆmpƒÉrtƒÉ»ôesc o lungƒÉ grani»õƒÉ terestrƒÉ »ôi maritimƒÉ, precum »ôi interese istorice »ôi teritoriale adesea conflictuale. Rom√¢nii ar avea multe motive sƒÉ nu fie de acord cu privire la atitudinea liderilor europeni »ôi ucraineni √Æn aceastƒÉ situa»õie. Singura voce criticƒÉ care le amplifica nemul»õumirea este cea a senatorului Diana Iovanovici-»òo»ôoacƒÉ, fondatoare »ôi lider al partidului S.O.S. Rom√¢nia. √én urmƒÉ cu trei ani, ea se remarcase deja pe scena europeanƒÉ pentru pozi»õiile sale puternice √Æmpotriva nara»õiunii pandemice. √éntr-un lung interviu, astƒÉzi, ea ne spune √Æn detaliu ce evolu»õii vede pentru conflictul ucrainean »ôi pentru viitorul rol al Rom√¢niei √Æn Europa. 1) Pozi»õia Dvs este √Æmpotriva nara»õiunii dominante prezentƒÉ √Æn acest moment √Æn Europa. √éntr-un moment a»ôa dificil »ôi delicat, care este √Æn opinia Dvs prioritatea absolutƒÉ pentru Rom√¢nia »ôi pentru Europa? 1. Pozi»õia mea nu a fost niciodatƒÉ √Æmpotriva a ceva, dec√¢t a rƒÉzboiului, de orice tip ar fi el, pentru cƒÉ rƒÉzboiul √ÆnseamnƒÉ moarte, pierderea de vie»õi omene»ôti, √Æn special a copiilor, persoane care, √Æn general, nu au nicio vinƒÉ cƒÉ existƒÉ politici √Ænclinate spre rƒÉzboi, cu subtilitƒÉ»õi financiare »ôi teritoriale.

Deci, la o primƒÉ vedere, ar fi extrem de u»ôor! Practica »ôi politicul ne omoarƒÉ! Prioritatea absolutƒÉ pentru Rom√¢nia ≈üi pentru Europa √Æn acest moment ar trebui sƒÉ fie ie≈üirea din logica periculoasƒÉ a conflictului ≈üi a √ÆncurajƒÉrii rƒÉzboiului din Ucraina pentru a opri √Æn acest fel at√¢t pierderea de vie»õi omene»ôti, c√¢t ≈üi criza economicƒÉ datoratƒÉ √Æn mare parte participƒÉrii Europei, at√¢t √Æn mod direct, c√¢t »ôi indirect, la acest conflict. At√¢ta vreme c√¢t Uniunea EuropeanƒÉ, c√¢t ≈üi √Æntreaga lume occidentalƒÉ, de aici »ôi de peste ocean, sunt parte din acest conflict pe care √Æl finan≈£eazƒÉ ≈üi √ÆnarmeazƒÉ, lucrurile nu vor reveni la normal, din contrƒÉ se vor amplifica cre√¢nd crize economice, financiare »ôi sociale fƒÉrƒÉ precedent √Æn istoria modernƒÉ »ôi contemporanƒÉ a lumii, √Æntorc√¢ndu-ne √Æn Evul Mediu. ≈ûi nu este vorba doar de sanc≈£iunile pe care UE le-a impus Rusiei ≈üi care lovesc √Æn primul r√¢nd economiile ≈£ƒÉrilor europene, »ôi la nivel macro al UE, ci ≈üi de banii direc≈£i investi≈£i √Æn acest conflict, fie sub formƒÉ de armament, fie sub formƒÉ de sprijin financiar pentru Ucraina, mƒÉsuri care doar prelungesc rƒÉzboiul √ÆndepƒÉrt√¢nd posibilitatea unei solu≈£ionƒÉri pa≈ünice. Cu c√¢t Europa investe≈üte mai mult √Æn acest conflict, cu at√¢t se pierd mai multe vie≈£i ≈üi se distrug mai multe bunuri, iar nivelul de trai al cetƒÉ≈£enilor din UE, fie ei italieni, rom√¢ni sau de altƒÉ na≈£ionalitate, se prƒÉbu≈üe≈üte. √én Italia se vorbe≈üte mult de problemele economice ale Italiei, √Æn Rom√¢nia de ale Rom√¢niei, ≈üi tot a≈üa √Æn fiecare stat UE, dar toate aceste discu≈£ii sunt inutile p√¢nƒÉ c√¢nd nu ne angajƒÉm √Æn √Æncheierea conflictului din Ucraina pentru a reveni, de exemplu, la achizi≈£ia de energie ieftinƒÉ care sƒÉ impulsioneze economiile noastre. Europa s-a autosanc≈£ionat √Æn acest conflict, iar pre≈£ul e plƒÉtit de cetƒÉ≈£eni, fie ei italieni, rom√¢ni sau de altƒÉ na≈£ionalitate.

facebook,"FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC AYEDE, TWO YEARS PROGRESS SO FAR. Of all the 5 polytechnic approved on the same date by the former president Muhammad Buhari, Only FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC AYEDE OGBOMOSO has started so far. - - In line with the determination of his administration to make tertiary education more accessible to young Nigerians, former President Muhammadu Buhari, in 2021, just about two years ago, established the Federal Polytechnic, Ayede, in Ogo-Oluwa Local Government Area Of Ogbomoso Zone in Oyo state, alongside five other Polytechnics. The President thereafter approved the appointments of eminent Nigerians, seasoned administrators, and core professionals as management teams and members of the Governing Council for the institution. Moments after his historic appointment, the Rector, and his management team settled down to rigorous work, and as a visionary and focused leader with the political will towards making the institution envious of all, Dr. Abdul-hameed-led management commenced and concluded the recruitment process for various positions in academic and non-academic cadres. Even though the management team is not resting on its oars to ensure that the citadel of learning is growing daily, it would be placed on record that the Federal Polytechnic, Ayede, is becoming the fastest-growing among its contemporaries. The institution, after inspection by a team of inspectors from the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), had successfully secured approval to run four courses while efforts are ongoing to secure approval for about fifteen more courses. The approved courses are Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Science Laboratory Technology, and Statistics respectively. In addition, Federal Polytechnic, Ayede (FEDPA), has not only completed admission processes and matriculated its 211 pioneer students but also commenced the first semester examinations at the Iresa-Pupa temporary site for the 2022/2023 academic session. Although, with these remarkable achievements, opinion molders and observers were of the view that the Dr. Abdul-hameed -led FEDPA management team has reached its crescendo, however, to the University of Ilorin trained electrical engineer, the only reward for success is continuous hard work. Addressing the staff recently at a two-day orientation workshop organised by the institution, the Rector said, ‚ÄúThe federal polytechnic, Ayede was established in 2021, just about two years ago, alongside five other polytechnics. Ever since then, the management team in conjunction with the Governing Council have been working hard to ensure that this institution is growing daily. ‚ÄúWhen you talk about the fastest growing polytechnic among its peers, sincerely yours, it‚Äôs not an understatement, Federal Polytechnic, Ayede stands out among the remaining five. Even though we were granted only four programmes to commence with, none of the other five polytechnics has been granted a single one. So, when we say we are the fastest growing polytechnic, it is not as if I am being boastful, but saying this to encourage us that we as foundation staff of this institution, still have a lot to do, to improve at the present level ‚Äù. As a relationship expert, Dr. Abdul-hameed has enjoyed a worthwhile relationship and conflict-free administration, especially with the Governing Council, principal officers, staff, the institution‚Äôs stakeholders, and the host communities. It is indeed imperative to state that over these past two (2) years, the Polytechnic under Dr. Abdul-hameed‚Äôs focused leadership has witnessed reasonable growth, as his efforts have not only attracted remarkable development to Federal Polytechnic, Ayede (FEDPA) using his networks and influence but has also opened up the fledging institution to great opportunities in a few years to come. The Polytechnic has received various support including the donation of staff quarters by former Senator Ayo Adeseun, the donation of four blocks of classrooms and offices at the Iresa-Pupa temporary site, the donation of a 18 seater bus & about 96million naira for renovations of temporal site during our take off by Hon. Sunday Dare, former Minister for Youths and Sports and fortunately an indigene of Ogbomoso, in addition to the four vehicles procured by the management, comprising three Hilux pickups and one Toyota sixteen seater bus. Others are the donation of laptops among other office equipment worth six million naira by the Ogbomoso Consultative Council (OCC), led by a former military governor of Oyo and Ogun states, Maj.

The Palestinian Islamic Movement Hamas launched a destructive attack on the Zionist occupation (Israel) leading to the demise of a minimum of 100 Israelis and causing injuries to hundreds. This attack, characterized as one of the most extensive in recent years, witnessed Hamas penetrating regions in the southern part of Israel. It came in the wake of a barrage of over 2,000 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip. In response to the devastating Hamas attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a declaration of war against Hamas, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict.

facebook,"Walla Walla ‚Äì People of Many Waters A Sahaptin tribe who lived for centuries on the Columbia River Plateau in northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, their name is translated several ways but, most often, as ‚Äúmany waters.‚Äù While the people have their own distinct dialect, their language is closely related to the Nez Perce. The tribe included many groups and bands that were often referred to by their village names, such as Wallulapum and Chomnapum. A hunter-gatherer tribe, they lived in ‚Äútents‚Äù that were easy to move. However, their lodging differed from many other nomadic tribes, in that it was bigger and covered with tule mats rather than hides. Called a longhouse, it was made out of lodge poles much like a tepee, but was much longer, sometimes as much as 80 feet in length. Resembling a modern-day ‚ÄúA‚Äù frame house in appearance, the lodge poles were covered with mats made of tule, a plant that grows freely in the area along waterways. When the tribe moved, the mats were gathered and moved and the lodge poles left behind. Beginning in the early 1700s the Walla Walla people raised great herds of horses, making their lifestyle much easier as they gathered seasonal plants. They also traveled across the Rocky Mountains to trade dried roots and salmon to the Plains Indians for buffalo meat and hides. The people were first encountered by white travelers during the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805. The explorers were warmly welcomed by Chief Yellepit, whose village of about 15 lodges, was situated on the Columbia River near the mouth of the Walla Walla River. The communication between the two groups was made between a Shoshone woman who had been captured by the Walla Walla and the expedition‚Äôs guide and interpreter, Sacagawea, who was also of the Shoshone tribe. Though Yelleppit extended an offer to the expedition to stay with the village, Lewis and Clark were in a hurry to reach the Pacific Ocean. However, they promised to spend a few days on their return. In April 1806, as the explorers began to make their way back east, the expedition spent several days with the Walla Walla, during which time, gifts were exchanged and goods traded. Two of the items left by the expedition with the tribe was a peace medal engraved with a portrait of Thomas Jefferson and a small American flag. In their documentation, Lewis and Clark estimated the tribe‚Äôs numbers as 1,600; however, this probably included other bands now recognized as independent. The next non-native to encounter the Walla Walla people was a trader by the name of David Thompson of the Canadian-British North West Company, who arrived in 1811. About five miles upriver from Chief Yellepit‚Äôs village, he staked a pole with a note claiming the territory for the British Crown and declaring that the North West Company intended to build a trading post at the site. Continuing downriver, Thompson stopped at Yellepit‚Äôs village, where he discovered the American ‚Äúclaims‚Äù in the form of Yellepit‚Äôs flag and medal. Though neither Lewis and Clark or Thompson had much power to actually lay claim to the region, Yellepit was very supportive of the idea of Canadians setting up a trading post nearby. By 1855, thousands of settlers had arrived in the region along the Oregon Trail and there was an insatiable demand for land and resources by the emigrants. In response, the new Washington Territory governor Isaac Stevens began to heavily pressure the Walla Walla and other area tribes to sign treaties agreeing to give up land and move to reservations. In May and June 1855, Stevens, along with Joel Palmer, Superintendent of the Oregon Territory, enacted three treaties at the Walla Walla Council. The Walla Walla, the Umatilla, and the Cayuse tribes were coerced to move from 4,000,000 acres of tribal lands to a reservation in northeastern Oregon, which was eventually reduced down to 72,000 acres over time. Other treaties were also established at the council with the Yakama, Palouse, and other tribes. That same year, gold was discovered on the recently established Yakama reservation, and conflict erupted between encroaching white miners and tribes of the Plateau. Many tribes eventually united together under the leadership of Yakama chief Kamiakin, marking the start of the Yakima War. Though the Walla Walla were initially not involved in the conflict, they, along with the Umitilla and Cayuse were eventually pulled into it. Today, many Walla Walla live on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. The Walla Walla share the land and a governmental structure with the Cayuse and the Umatilla tribes as part of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla. The three bands were united as a single tribal government in 1949 when the tribal leaders adopted a Constitution and By-laws. The confederate tribes currently have an enrollment of over 2,800 tribal members. The reservation is located in the area Pendleton, Oregon, near the Blue Mountains.",,136,"{'like_count': 104, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 43228}",Nativeamerican.1492,,2023-10-07 19:00:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/333814156_742849570809752_1367253775066570749_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=f8lAj6hoKKoAX-QiqHU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCx3eSOQbkN_ZDVMI7WEUQwP74mCeHVm-0iFiyPNnyxtg&oe=6559AEC7,https://www.facebook.com/100089357900736/posts/287941697527758,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386773675_287535204235074_5758638427417986507_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=HcJy09c-NWMAX8SXEap&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAxFIRQjS_kc1PRyuMeL0BR6tVzL70fWC0M4-Sp5EFhfg&oe=652768D9

facebook,"üëë EDWARD LONGSHANKS ~ KING OF ENGLAND üëë . üëë Edward I was born sometime during the night of the 17/18th of June 1239, at the Palace of Westminster. He was the son of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. His father decided to name him Edward, in honour of Edward the Confessor. Edward had not been a popular name amongst the English aristocracy. üëë During young Edward‚Äôs childhood, his poor health was a massive concern. Despite this, as an adult he reached a rather imposing six foot two inches in height. This was extremely rare for the time, and earned him the nickname ‚ÄúLongshanks‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúlong legs‚Äù. üëë When Edward was fourteen years of age, his father made a political decision, to arrange a marriage between his son and thirteen year old Eleanor of Castile, the half-sister of King Alfonso X of Castile. On 1st November 1254 in Castile, Edward married Eleanor, a marriage that would end up producing sixteen children! Unfortunately, only five daughters reached adulthood and one son, the future Edward II. üëë Edward became well-known during his reign for his contributions to reform. He encompassed medieval kingship in all its forms, serving as an administrator, soldier and a man of religious conviction. During his reign, many statutes were passed, in order to deal with the many problems that had been identified. üëë One of the main ones included ‚ÄòThe First Statute of Westminster‚Äô in 1275 which codified many existing laws from the time of the Magna Carta. One of Edward I‚Äôs greatest legacies, is the birth of the English Parliament. Under his leadership, the meetings became increasingly frequent, amounting to around forty-six occasions during his thirty-five year reign. üëë Much of his motivation for developing a form of government in the way that he did, was based on raising the necessary funds, through taxation, in order to wage wars. Some of these included waring with neighbours across the Channel. France also happened to be a strong ally of Scotland - another thorn in Edward‚Äôs side. üëë The first part of his reign was dominated by his dealings with Wales. In response to small uprisings occurring in Wales, he decided to take the approach on launching a complete conquest. He invaded in 1277, defeated Llwelyn ap Gryffyd, the Welsh leader, and subsequently went about building castles, in order to secure and demonstrate his power in the region. üëë Any signs of uprising were met with further violence, eventually ending Welsh hopes for independence. The country came under complete English authority and by 1301, Edward‚Äôs son was named Prince of Wales, a tradition that persists to this day. üëë His approach to similar issues of self-governance in Scotland however, were not so easy to resolve. Edward responded to uprisings across the border, which was met with a hostile response, continuing to cause conflict beyond his reign. üëë In 1290 Edward was recognised as overlord of Scotland, and at this time made the decision as to who would succeed to the Scottish throne. He chose John Balliol whom he treated as a puppet ruler. The Scottish nobility responded by deposing Balliol, and forming an alliance with France. üëë By 1296, Edward had invaded Scotland, imprisoned Balliol in the Tower of London and put the Scottish people under English rule. In this period he earned his nickname, ‚ÄòHammer of the Scots‚Äô. In 1290 he found a way to raise revenue. Sadly, he issued the 'Edict of Expulsion', a formal expulsion of all Jews from England ~ a decision which would generate much needed revenue by appropriating Jewish property. üëë Edward I continued to reign until 7th July 1307, when on his way to engage in conflict with Robert the Bruce in Scotland, he died. He was to be remembered as a bombastic, influential and an imposing figure who made decisions, both good and bad, which shaped the country for years to come. üëë Edward I's body was brought south, lying in state at Waltham Abbey, before being buried in Westminster Abbey on 27th October. There are few records of the funeral, which cost ¬£473. His large grey marble tomb chest, in which his bones lie, had no effigy or decoration, possibly the result of the shortage of royal funds. üëë In 1774 his tomb was opened and inside a Purbeck marble coffin, his body was found nearly entire, wrapped in a waxed linen cloth and wearing royal robes of red and gold with a crimson mantle. He had a gilt crown on his head, and carried a sceptre surmounted by a dove and oak leaves in enamels. Finding that the body had been well preserved over the preceding 467 years, an opportunity to determine the King's original height, was taken. üëë Traces of the Latin inscription on his tomb can still be seen, painted on the side of the tomb, referring to his vow to avenge the rebellion of Robert Bruce.

Let's talk about ""acetaminophen causing"" autism. If your partner or you have birthed a baby, or any friends even, did you discover that ibuprofen and naproxen were too harsh for the fetus? If every pregnant person is told to take ""acetaminophen,"" wouldn't it be coincidental versus a cause and effect situation?? The following can be found in ""Chapter 4: Autism at the Biological Level"" in a textbook called ""Autism: A New Introduction to Psychological Theory and Current Debate,"" published by Sue-Fletcher Watson & Francesca Happ√©. Page 53 ""1. The first evidence that autism had a strong genetic origin came from seminal twin studies that showed that identical twins, who share 100 percent of their genes, showed a much higher concordance (i.e. probability that, if one has autism [or preferably IS autistic], the other twin will too) than fraternal twins, who share on average 50 percent of their genetical material (Bailey et al., 1995; Folstein & Rutter, 1977). This finding and the resulting high hereditability estimates, have been replicated many times in subsequent and much larger studies (Tick et al., 2016). Autism also runs in families, with an increased likelihood of autism occurring in the younger brother or sister [or sibling, rather] of an autistic child."" However, I am the oldest, but I'm also the ONLY of my particular ""bloodline."" My biological mother and father didn't have any other kids as a unit---only me. For full transparency with regards to ""acetaminophen"" causing autism, this textbook was published in 2019. Page 52 says, ""Research **has** identified plenty of biological features that differ between people with and without autism [or preferably, autistic and allistic] people, and also features that vary dimensionally with a specific behaviour. But at the time of writing, there are no biological features that provide a distinctive marker, or specific cause, of autism (Muhle et al., 2018)."" However, Dragonfly and I were both informed that we weren't autistic via a free study at Vanderbilt University. If you can believe that there is conflict between different media, wouldn't it be reasonable to believe that there are systemic issues in place that cause people to believe that assigned female at birth (AFAB) people are ""less"" likely to be autistic?? Furthermore, Page 34 states: Figure 3.1---The autistic constellation. At the top of a 3-D space says, ""Auditory hypersensitivity,"" and at the bottom says, ""Spoken language.""

facebook,"# The Hand Of God In This War In Israel ## This is part of God's Plan to bring Israel back to Himself I was going to write about something else today, but it seems that events have overtaken the need to talk about Bible translation or eschatology. *But wait, how do we know that this isn't about eschatology?* Well, of course it is, and I've lived through some of what is happening now during the Second Intifada while I was living in Jerusalem. I assure you that this is nothing new, and it is all a part of God's plan. Unfortunately, it still hurts to see Israel and Israelis suffer. May God give them peace, and may the day when they recognize their Messiah come soon. ## War In Israel - Again When I first arrived in Israel in 1992, I thought that I understood the Arab-Israeli conflict. I thought that Israel was partly to blame and could have done better to resolve this conflict with the Arabs. ***It didn't take me very long to realize how stupid I was.*** I lived through the **Second Intifada** and had friends maimed by terrorist attack after terrorist attack. I had my neighborhood in Jerusalem shot up for a year. Busses have been blown up down the street from where I lived or from where I worked. ***Yet, I have never seen a more humane military than the Israel Defense Forces - The IDF.*** The carefulness with which Israel treats Arab civilians is astonishing in the face of the brutal attacks made against Israelis. When the Tanzim militia shot up my neighborhood of Gilo, every night from Beit Jalla, Israel carefully extracted the Arabs of that Christian town before taking out the Tanzim. ""To save a life"" is literally the most important phrase of Israeli culture. And, I've seen the internal torment that Israelis go through, when they are forced to make life difficult for Palestinians. They had to build that wall out of self defense, but they hated doing it. They've had to deny Gazans jobs in Israel, and they hated doing that. Even now, while Israel is under attack, Israelis do not wish any harm to come to the civilians of Gaza. But, Hamas has now left them without a choice. ## The Hand Of God And The Redemption Of Israel However, I want you to see the Hand of God in all of this. The Arab-Israeli wars have unified Israel in ways that nothing else could have. And, this current attack by Hamas has now caused the current civil war in Israel to end. I am not the only one to say this. Countless Israeli historians have remarked that Israelis would have fallen into civil war were it not for the great threat from her neighbors. But, there's even more to this than that. The Redemption of Israel is coming, and the prophets of the Hebrew Scriptures have been clear about the events that must come before it happens. In **[E](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+38-39&version=NKJV)zekiel 38 and 39,** it specifically says that Israel will finally recognize her Messiah after God destroys the armies of Gog and Magog. They will see Christ as their Lord and Savior, and **Zechariah 12 and 13** speak of their mourning over Him whom they pierced. But, the price will be higher than you could possibly imagine. **You can find more on that here:** **When Gog Comes** I wrote that book to pin down the timing of Israel's Redemption, hoping that I was wrong. What I discovered was horrifying in ways that I had not anticipated. It showed that not only my beloved Israel would suffer terribly, but that our civilization would be crushed. **It proved that this book was true in every way possible:** **Ezekiel's Fire** And, it proved that it must all come long before the Great Tribulation was even a hint on the horizon. ## Prove Me Wrong And Earn My Undying Gratitude I know that it is strange to contemplate the destruction of our civilization as part of Israel's Redemption. But, the prophets have spoken unanimously that this will happen. And, that it won't have anything to do with the Antichrist. I am horrified by this and am completely serious when I ask that someone prove me wrong. I have never in my life wanted to be so wrong about anything. So, unless someone can prove that Gog is the Antichrist and that the Battle of Armageddon is the battle of Gog and Magog - and you can't - we are stuck with the sickening knowledge that every city around the world will be crushed, electricity will permanently cease to exist, water distribution will fail, food will not get to the starving and billions will die. The thought of this is almost more than I can bear, and the writing of **When Gog Comes** was the most painful thing that I have ever done. Prove me wrong, and you will earn my undying gratitude. And I mean that with complete sincerity. Just know that all that is happening is a part of God's plan to bring Israel back to Himself and stick a thumb in the eye of Satan's plans.

facebook,"Fresh from the pen of Bill Salus at the Imminent Return Prophecy Summit. A just released book and DVD by author Bill Salus predicts a major war between Israel and its neighbors including Hamas. The Future War Prophecies identifies four prophecies that identify an epic conflict between Hamas and Israel. These foretellings go well beyond the general skirmishes between these Palestinians and Israelis. These four prophecies are identified below and deal with Hamas and the Gaza area by the historic names known to the prophets. These unfulfilled prophecies are summarized and presented in a logical sequential order below. ‚ÄúBut they, (the Israeli Air Force) shall fly down upon the shoulder of the Philistines, (Hamas), toward the west; Together they shall plunder the people of the East; They shall lay their hand on Edom, (Southern Jordan), and Moab; (Central Jordan), And the people of Ammon, (Northern Jordan) shall obey them.‚Äù (Isaiah 11:14, NKJV; emphasis added) Firstly, around 700 BC, Isaiah predicts that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) will fly over the Hamas in a war scenario. ‚ÄúThus says the Lord God: ‚ÄúBecause the Philistines dealt vengefully and took vengeance with a spiteful heart, to destroy because of the old hatred,‚Äù therefore thus says the Lord God: ‚ÄúI will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, (Hamas), and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the (Mediterranean) seacoast. I will execute great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I lay My vengeance upon them.‚Äù ‚Äô ‚Äù(Ezekiel 25:15-17, NKJV; emphasis added) Secondly, about one hundred years after Isaiah‚Äôs prophecy, Ezekiel explains how Hamas has harbored an ‚Äúold hatred‚Äù of Israel, which is why they launch a massive attack against Israel. The Lord promises to levy furious rebukes against these Palestinians because of this. In context with the prior passage in Ezekiel 25:12-14, it appears that these rebukes will be executed by the IDF. ‚ÄúFor Gaza shall be forsaken, And Ashkelon desolate; They, (the IDF), shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, And Ekron shall be uprooted. Woe to the inhabitants of the (Mediterranean) seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: ‚ÄúI will destroy you; So there shall be no inhabitant.‚Äù The (Mediterranean) seacoast shall be pastures, With shelters for shepherds and folds for flocks. The coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; (Israel), They shall feed their flocks there; In the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down at evening. For the Lord their God will intervene for them, And return their captives.‚Äù (Zephaniah 2:4-7, NKJV; emphasis added) Thirdly, Zephaniah informs of the end results. Say ‚Äúgoodbye Hamas‚Äù as ‚Äúthere shall be no inhabitant‚Äù left. Instead the Israelis will capture the territory and use it to ‚Äúfeed their flocks there.‚Äù This is the result of ‚Äúthe Lord their God will intervene for them.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey have said, ‚ÄúCome, and let us cut them off from being a nation, That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.‚Äù For they have consulted together with one consent; They form a confederacy against You: The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagrites; Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek Philistia, (Hamas in Gaza), with the inhabitants of Tyre; Assyria also has joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot. Selah‚Äù (Psalm 83:4-8, NKJV; emphasis added) (See map below to identify the Psalm 83 populations today). Lastly, the prophet and psalmist Asaph, tells us that the Hamas ultimately enlist in an Arab confederacy that wants to wipe Israel off of the map. This is ultimately what brings about the end of Hamas.

""On a beautiful afternoon in 1959, Coretta and I journeyed from our hotel in Beirut to take a plane for Jerusalem. After about two hours in the air we were notified to fasten our seat belts -- we were beginning to descend for the airport in Jerusalem. Because of the Arab-Israeli conflict, this city has been divided. And so this was a strange feeling -- to go to the ancient city of God and see the tragedies of man's hate and evil which causes him to fight and live in conflict. Israel's right to exist as a state in security is incontestable. At the same time the great powers have the obligation to recognize that the Arab world is in a state of imposed poverty and backwardness that must threaten peace and harmony. Until a concerted and democratic program of assistance is affected, tensions cannot be relieved. So there is a need for a Marshall Plan for the Middle East. At the heart of the problem are oil interests. As the American Jewish Congress has stated, ""American policies in the Middle East have been motivated in no small measure by the desire to protect the $2.5 billion stake which U.S. oil companies have invested in the area."" Some Arab feudal rulers are no less concerned for oil wealth and neglect the plight of their own peoples. The solution will have to be found in statesmanship by Israel and progressive Arab forces who, in concert with the great powers, recognize that fair and peaceful solutions are the concern of all of humanity. Neither military measures nor a stubborn effort to reverse history can provide a permanent solution. As I said in my Nobel Peace Prize Lecture: Nations are not reducing, but rather increasing, their arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. The proliferation of nuclear weapons has not been halted. The fact that most of the time human beings put the risk of nuclear war out of their minds because it is too painful does not alter the risk of such a war. Man's proneness to engage in war is still a fact, but wisdom born of experience should tell us that war is obsolete. If we assume that life is worth living, that man has a right to survive, then we must find an alternative. In a day when guided ballistic missiles carve highways of death through the stratosphere, no nation can claim victory in war. A so-called limited war will leave little more than a calamitous legacy of human suffering, political turmoil and political disillusionment. A world war, God forbid, would leave only smoldering ashes as a mute testimony to the human race whose folly led to ultimate death. If modern man continues to flirt unhesitatingly with war, he will transform his earthly habitat into an inferno even the mind of Dante could not imagine. It is not enough to say we must not wage war. It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must shift the arms race into the peace race. In 1967, when I took my stand against the war in Vietnam, I recounted that I had lived in the ghettos of Chicago and Cleveland, and I knew the hurt, the cynicism and the discontent. As I walked among the desperate, rejected and angry young men, I told them Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I tried to offer my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they asked, and rightly so, ""What about Vietnam?"" They asked if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government. In 1957, a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution. This need to maintain social stability for our investments . . . tells why American helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Cambodia and why American napalm and Green Beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru. . . . It is with such activities in mind that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us. He said, ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."" Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken, the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments.

facebook,"Good morning First UMC! This is Pastor Todd, and I had hoped that my first post about our Bible Land journey would be a little different, but here we are. As I write this, our ship is stopped in the middle of the Mediterranean. Many of you might be aware already that the ongoing conflict between Israel and groups in Gaza - namely Hamas - have escalated unexpectedly. Given the speed and enormity of the attack from Gaza, we are unclear as to whether we will be able to port in Haifa tomorrow to begin our journey in the Holy Land. We are unclear as to whether we will continue this leg of our journey as planned, or whether there will be a reordering of our itinerary, or possibly some alternative to our itinerary. What I am positive about though is that we are all safe, and the authorities responsible for making these decisions are currently deliberating our next steps. Safety will always be the top priority. We will still make our journey to Egypt, to visit Ephesus, and to finish our time in Athens and Corinth. The three days in the Holy Land may or may not take place. It may be the order of our trip is altered. More than anything, I am positive of God‚Äôs reassuring hand on all of us. This morning, we had a great lecture about the Holy Land presented by Pastor Adam Hamilton. And while he spoke to us about the sites we would see and their significance, I am reminded now of the many friends I have made over the years in Israel proper and throughout the West Bank. I am saddened by the fear and uncertainty they must be experiencing at this very moment. While we worry about our trip being interrupted, many of them are fearing for their very lives and futures. So while I am certain you all are praying for those of us on our journey right now, please join me in praying for all of those affected by this latest turns of events in the Holy Land.

facebook,"YOUR LOVE LANGUAGE: ACTS OF SERVICE When your love language is Acts of Service, you shine your brightest by demonstrating your love through helpful actions. Here's what it looks like when you're at your best and potential trouble spots during conflicts or stress: At Your Best: ü•∞You excel in anticipating your partner's needs and going the extra mile to make their life easier and more comfortable. ü•∞You take pride in completing tasks that alleviate their burdens, whether it's preparing a favorite meal, handling chores, or offering assistance. ü•∞Your thoughtful actions consistently show your commitment, dedication, and love, creating a sense of security and appreciation in your relationship. ü•∞Your selflessness and willingness to serve make your partner feel cherished and valued. Trouble Spots During Conflict or Stress: üò¨ Overextending Yourself: In the pursuit of helping, you might take on too much, leading to exhaustion and potential burnout. üò¨ Expecting Reciprocity: You may unintentionally expect your partner to show love in the same way, causing disappointment if they have a different love language. üò¨ Miscommunication: During conflicts, your partner might perceive your acts of service as a way to avoid addressing underlying issues, which can lead to miscommunication. üò¨ Unspoken Expectations: Frustration can arise when your acts of service go unnoticed or unappreciated, leading to feelings of neglect. üò¨ Neglecting Verbal Affirmation: It's essential to remember that verbal communication is equally important. During stress or conflicts, make an effort to express your feelings verbally, too. In challenging times, remember to balance your acts of service with open communication. Address conflicts by actively listening to your partner's concerns and expressing your love verbally. By maintaining this balance, you can navigate stress and conflicts while continuing to demonstrate your love through meaningful actions.",,128,"{'like_count': 102, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 88642}",ARROW Endeavours Inc.,,2023-10-07 16:32:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/309416719_532181632243235_5445318054158819316_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yN5p7FD48EMAX-hBrFO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDTnyuFz5zwEmlDbIFeKtKtIhvMg0q7xE44Vdq6J2CvXg&oe=655A455C,https://www.facebook.com/100063542084693/posts/825105092950886,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387744245_825104989617563_9222165457849366775_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=96MEr6h-w2YAX_S4PAu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBSng3Z0vHcwhdTPYBIjkSg_-vEDoHvplczstG74vofzg&oe=6530F127
facebook,"Just a reminder that the World Press had already concluded Tinubu's matter. TINUBU WORLD TABLOID HEADLINES This is how the global press described what we did with ourselves called elections: *The Economist* said a _‚Äúchaotically organized vote and messy count‚Äù_ gave Nigeria a new president. *The Financial Times* said in an editorial comment that our presidential election was _‚Äúdeeply flawed‚Äù_ and the winner _‚Äúa wealthy political fixer.‚Äù_ *The Guardian of U.K.* described the winner as _‚Äúan immensely wealthy veteran powerbroker trailed by corruption allegations which he denies.‚Äù_ *The New York Times* described him as _‚Äúa divisive figure in Nigerian politics.‚Äù_ *Robert Rotberg,* founding director of the Harvard Kennedy School's programme on intrastate conflict, wrote an opinion for *Canada's influential Globe and Mail*; its headline: _‚ÄúBola Tinubu's election is another triumph for Nigeria's corrupt old guard.‚Äù_ *The Times of London* was the most disrespectful. It used this very bad phrase: _‚Äúa wealthy kleptocratic 'godfather' of politics‚Äù_ to describe the person who will replace our very clean Buhari on May 29, 2023. As bad as those characterizations are, they are not as damaging as the Financial Times' revelation that it personally _‚Äúwitnessed armed men remove a presidential ballot box in Surulere, Lagos‚Äù_ on Election Day. *The CNN* last Friday played back a part of Bola Tinubu's acceptance speech where he described what he got as _‚Äúa serious mandate.‚Äù_ A CNN anchor then asked if it _‚Äúwas really a mandate‚Äù_ with less than 10 percent of the registered voters behind it. He must be wondering what kind of people are these? The CNN and that anchor were not the only ones bemused by our electoral culture, our elections and their outcomes. One of *Germany's* largest newspapers, *Sueddeutsche Zietung*, had unflattering words for the winner; it also queried the legitimacy of a mandate that was spurned by 90 per cent of the voting population. *Aljazeera* ran a special report on how the election was disrupted in Lagos last Saturday. The headline is: _'How violence robs Nigerians of their votes.'_ *The Washington Post* quoted Matthew Page, associate fellow with Chatham House‚Äôs Africa Program, as accusing INEC of making both deliberate and unintentional mistakes: _‚ÄúThey raised the hopes about the election and its transparency, and then they dashed them. When the opposition says the process was broken, it‚Äôs hard to argue with them.‚Äù_ Foreign election observers from the *US International Republican Institute (IRI)* and the *National Democratic Institute (NDI)* summed up their opinion of the election as falling _‚Äúwell short of Nigerian citizens‚Äô legitimate and reasonable expectations.‚Äù_ I have spent the past five days reading informed commentaries and listening to credible voices. I have not seen, read or heard a single positive review of the election in any credible media in any country of the world. I have been around long enough to conclude that Tinubu's 2023 mandate is rivaled in content, texture and review probably only by Shehu Shagari's Verdict '83 mandate. *Other Newspaper Headlines from around the world* *Austria:* _A drug baron wins the presidential election in Africa‚Äôs biggest economy._ *Poland:* _Nigeria chooses a known drug lord as LEADER._ *Canada:* _""Depression, anxiety, uncertainty be-clouds Nigeria‚Äôs political space a drug-kingpin wins the election.""_",,127,"{'like_count': 58, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 52754}",Labour Party Plateau State Chapter,,2023-10-07 16:02:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/295302775_111946714924408_1336880542993130303_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Edb6WmPUnQIAX_5GMD3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDlAFzQ2TLul39805Jntf2ElZ_VEO07mSzZmyE4hDvTOw&oe=655A770C,https://www.facebook.com/100083329843303/posts/294596776661315,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387775318_294596723327987_8422391457945542831_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=B_E9Dv5Dh4UAX8inXV1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA535faYtI8tqJhJZX2fKwbhgE4kWiQjuT9kpneE0SPmA&oe=652583C7

facebook,"The Irish Roots Of John Lennon John Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 in Liverpool, England. His paternal great-grandparents named Lennon came from Co. Down. His paternal grandmother Mary (Polly) Maguire came from Dublin. Her parents came from Wexford. John‚Äôs maternal Great-grandmother came from Tyrone. Two of his maternal great-grandparents were From Wales. His maternal grandfather was English. Liverpool was heavily Irish. It was flooded with refugees of The Great Hunger of the 1840s like John‚Äôs great-grandparents, and steadily afterward. The Merseyside area is said to have the highest concentration of people of Irish blood outside of Ireland itself. Lennon was always conscious of his Irish heritage, as were the other Beatles. For example, George Harrison's maternal grandfather came from Co. Wexford while Paul McCartney's maternal grandfather came from Co. Monaghan. Early in their career, the Beatles would vacation in Ireland. In 1967, Lennon purchased the island of Dorinish in Clew Bay, Co. Mayo. It was sold after his death with the ¬£30,000 proceeds being donated to an Irish children's charity. In the Beatles' 1964 movie ""A Hard Day's Night"", Lennon speaks volumes as he tells the character of Paul's Irish immigrant grandfather that instead of Liverpool, he should have gone to Boston, where he would have been treated with more respect. With the onset of the conflict in the north, his anger was awakened at the treatment of the Irish. This anger would show itself in his music. His 1972 album ""Some Time In New York City"" features not one, but two songs about Ireland. Click the links below to hear them. The song ""The Luck Of The Irish"" tells the overall story of brutal repression, hunger, mass emigration, partition. He tips his hat to the Irish community in Liverpool ""the 'Pool"". He questions what the British are doing in Ireland and calls them ""brigands"" and ""bastards"", who are guilty of genocide. On the album cover, which is in the style of a New York Times newspaper; the lyrics to all the songs are written, he is careful to point out that he wrote this song first (these two songs are the only ones that show dates). His wife Yoko Ono co-wrote and sang as a duet with him. Click to view: https://youtu.be/p4cPoaXRRrg?si=tSDEkSP6m-gBMIyd:=:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4cPoaXRRrg ""The Luck Of The Irish"" By John Lennon and Yoko Ono If you had the luck of the Irish You'd be sorry and wish you were dead You should have the luck of the Irish And you'd wish you was English instead! A thousand years of torture and hunger Drove the people away from their land A land full of beauty and wonder Was raped by the British brigands! Goddamn! Goddamn! If you could keep voices like flowers There'd be shamrock all over the world If you could drink dreams like Irish streams Then the world would be high as the mountain of Mourne In the 'Pool they told us the story How the English divided the land Of the pain, the death and the glory And the poets of auld Eireland If we could make chains with the morning dew The world would be like Galway Bay Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns The world would be one big Blarney stone Why the hell are the English there anyway? As they kill with God on their side Blame it all on the kids the IRA As the bastards commit genocide! Aye! Aye! Genocide! If you had the luck of the Irish You'd be sorry and wish you were dead You should have the luck of the Irish And you'd wish you was English instead! Yes you'd wish you was English instead! Lennon pointed out that he wrote ""Luck Of The Irish"" first as if to emphasize that his feelings preceded the infamous massacre that inspired the other song-""Sunday Bloody Sunday"". On January 30, 1972, a peaceful civil rights march protesting Internment-mass imprisonment without trial in Derry City was fired on by the British Army. Thirteen innocent protesters were killed, another died later of his wounds. In the song ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", Lennon's familiar image as a peace activist is missing. Here he preaches vengeance and revolution. He emphasises the innocence of the victims and condemns Internment. He acknowledges ""Free Derry"". He re-iterates his opinion that the ""kids"" are often falsely blamed. The line about ""Stormont bans our marches"" leaves no doubt about what he considered himself. He calls the loyalists's ancestors ""Anglo pigs and Scotties""; and suggests that they return to Britain if they will not join a United Ireland, because they are a minority on the island as a whole. He refers the the prison camps, such as Long Kesh as concentration camps. He mentions Falls Road in Belfast to stand for communities affected by the Troubles, and finally asserts Ireland's right to independence and unity while rejecting any notion of sectarianism towards Protestants-""Ireland for the Irish, not for London or for Rome"".

facebook,"# ** ISTHMUS OF CHIGNECTO ** **---------------------------------------------------------------------** **----The name Chignecto i**s a European adaptation of the Mi‚Äôkmaw term for a much larger region, Siknikt or Sikniktuk, the drainage place, that extends from the Cobequid highlands to the eastern edge of the Wolastoq (Saint John) River drainage area, and north to the Baie de Chaleur. The isthmus, at the centre of that district, is a resource-rich marshland traversed by rivers and portage routes that link the Bay of Fundy to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and further to major river routes leading to the interior of the continent. Siknikt is a large district of Mi‚Äôkma‚Äôki, with the isthmus at its centre, whereas what is currently called Chignecto is a small strip of land, the margins of two provinces bisected by a border first created by imperial competition in 1713. Much of the research, writing, and storytelling about this region have focused on the history of Chignecto as a point of division between French and British colonial claims, centering imperial perspectives, and thereby marginalizing the perspectives of those who lived there. There had been a significant Mi‚Äôkmaw presence at Chignecto for millennia when, in the seventeenth century, a small Acadian group started a settlement there. This group planted the seed of a community that would grow and spread over its eighty-year history, sharing Chignecto with existing and also growing Mi‚Äôkmaw communities. These communities managed a coexistence in this space without colonial administrative presence, creating a distinctly independent region, until the French-British conflict brought the story of the shared place to a crisis in the 1750s. -**---Existing archaeology** also bears witness to the mobility associated with Chignecto. Connected by the coastal and river routes , the Indigenous peoples of the region travelled throughout Mi‚Äôkma‚Äôki and had access to goods from throughout the region. In Chignecto they encountered other cultures over millennia, adopting or adapting technologies and exchanging goods.[ ](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lib.unb.ca%2Findex.php%2FJNBS%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F32890%2F1882528135%3Finline%3D1%26fbclid%3DIwAR2yzR3nPz5-H2gHnsu3PnJG22JT9yBPF_6Jk3HEcy-LyFIjHeIN9aLc79c%23no16&h=AT1P9n8S4AevXfASMUyOagjBjsBAH-SsllEeCdPQq-MiCAgvPnVncDDKiJnDhj1Ina1fm4HMDoU-2L2sCcOnFGOlLbDzPoQgON3V8fFJMDtQTaxJ_8WgTUUm5qownncgOw&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT1vura_XLFksuPsB1YRnZKB-k1XqjMm8uLZ3XATblmqF_PX4UvWd1X7jgGDcmq3gHoPqqyT19YnwfobVOBCeLQODqTRIohI3NxgZEtb4DZW8GQh-KPpuy1asKOp9aBWmlNwBuLOB25bVJfOSUCiOC2ZZKNE7JVXZoS3-XnAqa8LYD-sFjUVe2Zl8lE48jB4fi5-OsA36y6vJQVfk8Dt880) In 1613, Father Pierre Biard observed in his early description of Acadia that the wealth of fish and wildlife at Chignecto made it possible for Mi‚Äôkmaw inhabitants there to lead a sedentary life, something he did not believe was true of other community locations in Mi‚Äôkma‚Äôki. Missionaries‚Äô census data from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries confirm the presence of a significant and stable Mi‚Äôkmaw community in the Chignecto region, sometimes identified as being at Beaubassin others as *Missagoueche*.[ ](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lib.unb.ca%2Findex.php%2FJNBS%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F32890%2F1882528135%3Finline%3D1%26fbclid%3DIwAR31SBLsbm3IBbXitaObeseMJYIKC9CP7TmU-I5gbFozXj8No5YTTPootEs%23no17&h=AT3_T1wkO4e3ncDjtg9KbTVBkNTzjtymrLST0nS3LXBzICYFC8wNFB-NgAZ1dDv_vFVTYQ3Yr5Q7VpcXNtytF45KXGB74AefAnMt8M8AKszyIwC2cI1PIDxM-QT5GHqIAA&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT1vura_XLFksuPsB1YRnZKB-k1XqjMm8uLZ3XATblmqF_PX4UvWd1X7jgGDcmq3gHoPqqyT19YnwfobVOBCeLQODqTRIohI3NxgZEtb4DZW8GQh-KPpuy1asKOp9aBWmlNwBuLOB25bVJfOSUCiOC2ZZKNE7JVXZoS3-XnAqa8LYD-sFjUVe2Zl8lE48jB4fi5-OsA36y6vJQVfk8Dt880) This existing community and its connectedness with the larger region formed part of the attraction for the project of settlement begun in the 1670s by the married couple Jacques Bourgeois and Jeanne Trahan, and their extended family, sons and daughters, and their spouses. Although this family was intent on agriculture and clearing land, trade was also part of their livelihood, and access to trade was an important consideration in choosing their new settlement. **----The Isthmus of Chignecto** separates the waters of the Bay of Fundy from those of Bay Verte, and constitutes the neck of land which saves Nova Scotia from being an island. It is seventeen miles between the two bays at the narrowest point, and considering the town of Amherst the south-eastern limit, and the village of Sackville the north-western, it may be putdown as a little less than ten miles in width. **----The southern slope** is drained by four tidal riversor creeks, namely.

facebook,"#LifeClass Ministering : Pastor Jite Orimiono Topic: The husband as a leader Text: Ephesians 5:22-23, Luke 12:48 We are all called into leadership. That means responsibility, leadership is not about telling, it's about showing. Jesus Christ he was a servant leader, He led by example and taught His disciples how and what to do, they watched him pray. Leadership starts from the home, by showing and by doing. It is important to know that when you marry you become a husband leader One of the greatest problems that families have to contend with in the home is lack of leadership, it is the reason most marriages are breaking. How do you position yourself to be found? In your place of service. Where is your root? Where are you planted? Who are you submitting to? That's very important because when we talk about submission we only look at it from the perspective of the wife, submission is twofold. The wife is submitting to you; you must be submitting to a higher authority. It is important to emphasize that the family is the foundation of society and that's why it is important everybody has a part to play. To whom much is given, much is expected (Luke 12:48) Six P‚Äôs of marriage 1. Pattern: pattern is a model design, it is a prototype 2. Purpose: purpose is the reason for it 3. Protocol: It is procedure/guidelines that surround the institution of marriage 4. Process: process is a series of events that lead to an outcome 5. Personalities: If one of these two personalities is defective it affects the outcome, so it is essential that when you are choosing a partner you seek counsel, knowledge first. 6. Principles: that's the guiding laws If the purpose is not known, abuse is inevitable. A Leadership framework Leadership is a process, with objectives, motivation, trust, and integrity. If leadership is the process of influencing others through direction, inspiration, motivation to attain some identified objectives, so if it is marriage; What is your objective? There must be a goal. As a husband, everybody draws strength from you. You need to develop your muscles enough to want to carry another, marriage is a baptism, it's a baptism that's one of the dimensions of marriage. When you get married at the point where you take the vows, you are immersed into the other person. What leads to a lack of leadership in the home? 1. Wrong leadership style 2. Lack of your presence as a husband and a father 3. Those who avoid responsibility, and they relinquish their role to their wives. Two is better than one. What does it take to embody this leadership quality that is lacking in many homes? (Colossians 2:9) 1. You must lead by example 2. Check your lifestyle, your speech should be Godly and good. 3. Communication is very important How do you conduct yourself for your business? 1. Lead by example (John 13:15) 2. Be committed to moral principles. Marriage requires submission, services and sacrifice. Your Existence is for the benefit of the other person because your spouse is your number one priority. Be an example of honesty and humility and integrity in your business or in your home. Lead by loving, God loved us unconditionally. Dream and share the Family Vision. Seek knowledge before marriage not love. Set the tone for prayer and family devotion. Learn to de-escalate conflict. Create warmth and friendship if you want to be a husband leader. Lead by management. Be self-disciplined, learn how to rule your own house (1 Timothy 3:5) your house must be your priority.

SERUAN MUNAJAT UNTUK AL-AQSA

1. PAS mengikuti secara dekat pertempuran yang berlaku antara Palestin dan Israel yang bermula pada hari ini. Serangan besar-besaran telah dilancarkan oleh HAMAS dan Jihad Islami dalam 'Operasi Taufan Al-Aqsa' selepas berlakunya ketegangan selama beberapa minggu di sempadan Gaza-Israel.

2. Saya menyeru kepada seluruh umat Islam untuk menunaikan solat hajat, membaca doa qunut nazilah dan bermunajat untuk saudara Islam kita di bumi Gaza, serta mengadakan 'Himpunan Solidariti bersama al-Quds' sebagai bantahan terhadap tindakan zalim Israel yang merampas tanah bumi Palestin. 

Al-Quds adalah milik umat Islam.

PAS President's Media Statement

URGENT CALL TO PRAY FOR AL-AQSA

1. PAS is closely monitoring the escalating conflict between Palestine and Israel that erupted today. Following several weeks of heightened tension along the Gaza-Israel border, Hamas and Jihad Islami launched a large-scale offensive named 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.'

2. I earnestly urge all Muslims to engage in hajat prayer, recite the qunut nazilah supplication, and make dua for our Muslim brothers and sisters in Gaza. Let us also convene a 'Solidarity Gathering for al-Quds' as a strong protest against Israel's oppressive actions, which continue to infringe upon Palestinian territory.

Remember, Al-Quds rightfully belongs to the Muslim community.

facebook,"TIPOLOGII UMANE Cei nascuti in zilele de 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31 ‚Äì Tipologia A1 ‚Äì Curgere si apa Dintre toate tipologiile, oamenii A1 sunt cei care au viziunea cea mai calda si mai frumoasa asupra iubirii. Pentru ei insisi, intregul lor destin se rezuma la ‚Äúa iubi‚Äù, iar daca nu reusesc acest lucru se simt nefericiti, neimpliniti, traind cu sentimentul ca nu si-au atins menirea in viata. Se indragostesc de multe ori in viata, cu prea multa usurinta am putea spune, de fiecare data ca si cand ar fi prima si ultima oara, insa dezvolta relatii sentimentale de o natura neobisnuita, adesea furtunoase si intense. Au o natura prietenoasa si adora sa traiasca in mijlocul celorlalti, inconjurati de viata, de tumult, de agitatie si de complicatii. Sunt precum apa: dinamici, plini de viata, agili, se strecoara printre stanci si oameni si in ciuda obstacolelor reusesc cumva sa iasa la suprafata. Chiar daca nu realizeaza, au capacitatea de a-i modela pe ceilalti, contribuind la evolutia lor interioara. Sunt insa si schimbatori si uneori, in ciuda unor calitati remarcabile, prea umili, modesti si sensibili la gesturile si cuvintele celor din jur. Cei nascuti in zilele de 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 ‚Äì Tipologia A2 ‚Äì Foc si visuri Oamenii A2 au visuri inalte, asteptari si cerinte de proportii cosmice de la ei insisi, iar viata lor intreaga se construieste in jurul implinirii ambitiilor si dorintelor lor secrete. S-au nascut sa se redescopere, sa se lase modelati si sa nu isi lase spiritul sa se stinga. Sunt perfectionisti innascuti si atunci cand vine vorba de ceea ce-si doresc rareori fac lucrurile pe jumatate. Oameni A2 sunt ca focul: spontani, minunati, puternici, creativi, dominanti pana la cotropire, crezand intens in propria putere, impunand respect si admiratie, dar totodata si teama. Nu multi sunt cei care le stau neconditionat in preajma fara a nu se simti folositi, manipulati, influentati chiar si la un nivel inconstient. Cu greu incredinteaza unei persoane, fie ea si prieten, increderea lor. Pot fi numiti oricum, numai naivi nu. Isi cunosc interesele si stiu sa puna in balanta atat aspectele pozitive cat si pe cele negative ale unei chestiuni. Iubirea si implinirea sentimentala ocupa un loc important in viata oamenilor A2, insa intotdeauna cautarea persoanei potrivite se aseamana prea mult cu cautarea perfectiunii. Iubirea le survine pe o cale mai anevoioasa si de multe ori constata cu tristete ca au iubit cu adevarat atunci cand relatia respectiva se afla la final. Este foarte posibil ca de-a lungul vietii sa dezvolte tendinta spre egoism, malitiozitate, insensibilitate si sa emita exigente prea mari de la partenerul de viata. Cei nascuti in zilele de 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28 ‚Äì Tipologia C3 ‚Äì Aer si libertate Oamenii C3 sunt nascuti sa fie liberi, sa-si exprime sentimentele, sa spuna deschis ceea ce gandesc, sa circule dupa bunul plac, sa calatoreasca, sa cunoasca, sa experimenteze dupa legile propriului arbitru, sa transmita mai departe cunostintele pe care le detin. De multe ori, idealurile lor de viata nu cunosc o reprezentare concreta si materiala, ci sunt simbolizate de alte persoane. Oamenii C3 sunt totodata extrem de pasionali si impulsivi si pot deveni dependenti de cei pe care ii iubesc, avand tendinta de a-i sufoca, de a-i absorbi spiritual. Chiar daca detin arta stapanirii si a controlarii emotiilor, uneori deciziile pe care le iau ii sperie pe cei din jur prin necunoscutul si controversele carora le dau nastere. Daca vrei sa te iubeasca, lasa-i liberi si nu le ingradi spiritul. Sunt facuti sa simta, sa vada, sa guste, sa se delecteze cu tot ce este mai frumos pe lumea aceasta, sa experimenteze senzatii si emotii supreme. Cu greu poti fi legati de un loc, insa daca isi gasesc aici rostul, dupa lungi peregrinari, se intorc de buna voie la ceea ce au lasat in urma. Cei nascuti in zilele de 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29 ‚Äì Tipologia D4 ‚Äì Pamant si stabilitate Oamenii D4 sunt precum pamantul -consistenti, vitali, esentiali pentru existenta celorlalti, stabili, exercitand un magnetism aparte, toleranti pana la extreme, cu o minte ascutita si patrunzatoare. Sunt oameni practici, calmi, pacifisti, echilibrati, cu un simt al judecatii si al ratiunii foarte bine dezvoltat, stapanindu-si emotiile si exteriorizandu-le doar in fata acelor persoane pe care le considera a avea o afinitate cu ei. Cred in prietenie, in stabilitatea ei si o plaseaza adesea asupra tuturor celorlalte relatii interumane. Sunt insa adesea greoi, prea cerebrali, lipsiti de spontaneitate, luand deciziile cu mintea si mai putin cu sufletul. Felul lor de a iubi este unul loial, stabilind relatii de lunga durata cu o persoana care le aduce liniste si armonie. Chiar daca vor iubi intens si se vor simti atrasi de o persoana cu o personalitate opusa lor, vor avea tendinta de a se retrage la primul semn de conflict sau neintelegere. Foarte probabil ca se vor sustrage dintr-o relatie prea pasionala sub pretextul ca nu este ceea ce isi doresc de la viata.

Mo Yan smiled as she went out. The director also sent a message to her assistant asking him to help Mo Yan with making the tea. Although she could only move her right hand, Mo Yan was skilled in making tea. With the help of the director‚Äôs assistant, Mo Yan quickly brewed the tea and was accompanied back to the office by the assistant. She then served the tea to everyone. The fragrance of the black tea was rich, and its color was clear. Just smelling it was a form of enjoyment. As Mo Lian saw that Mo Yan had brewed the tea so quickly, her expression became a little unfriendly. She immediately glared at the director‚Äôs assistant, who pretended not to see her and left the office after helping to serve the tea. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve brewed tea. My skills are a little rusty. Everyone, please have a taste. ‚Äù The director and Xu Tian picked up their cups and started drinking. The supervisor of Team B glanced at the supervisor of Team D and helplessly picked up the teacup as well. Mo Lian saw that everyone else had drunk the tea. Although she was dissatisfied that Mo Yan had successfully brewed the tea, she had no choice but to pick up the teacup and take a sip because she was a guest in Hong Jing. Cough! Cough Cough! Suddenly, a violent cough sounded. Mo Lian covered her mouth with a tissue and glared at Mo Yan. ‚ÄúMo Yan! What did you give me to drink? ! Why is it so bitter? ‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Mo Yan raised her eyebrows and smiled, ‚ÄúThis black tea‚Äôs leaves are plump and thick. The brewed tea is slightly acidic-tasting and bitter, helping to invigorate oneself. It also helps in detoxification and has a sweet aftertaste. ‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you say that this is slightly bitter and acidic-tasting? ‚Äù Mo Lian‚Äôs sharp voice was unpleasant. ‚ÄúIndeed! ‚Äù After saying that, as if afraid that Mo Lian would not believe it, Mo Yan took a sip. Mo Lian stared at Mo Yan, whose expression did not change, and frowned. Suddenly, a suspicion arose in her heart. ‚ÄúMo Yan! Did you add something to my tea? Otherwise, it would not be so bitter! ‚Äù Mo Yan smiled and replied, ‚ÄúHow is that possible? Ms. Mo Lian, you are a big client of our company. Why would I do such a thing? ‚Äù DOWNLOAD NOW!

At the end of the day, both of them were surnamed Mo, and they were both Mo Dong‚Äôs children. Any conflict between them was their family‚Äôs internal business and wouldn‚Äôt affect the cooperation. However, if they brought their personal grudges to the cooperation between the companies, then that kind of partnership would need to be considered more carefully. In the business world, there were many projects that flopped due to bringing personal feelings into the work. The purpose of cooperation was to make profits. If it didn‚Äôt make profits in the end, it would be better to put an end to that possibility before the cooperation. However, a few executives from Hong Jing presently had some understanding of the Mo Lian‚Äôs arrogance and despotism. The cooperation being based on equality and mutual benefit aside, that the two families were cooperating under the conditions of mutual and equal benefit aside, for starters, it was not wise to start a fight just like that when it was one‚Äôs first time going to another company. Looking at Mo Yan‚Äôs smiling face, Mo Lian felt like she could not take it anymore. She wanted to grab Mo Yan and give her a few tight slaps. ‚ÄúMo Yan, you also said that I‚Äôm a big client of your company. Why are you treating your clients with such bitter tea? I think you‚Äôre deliberately trying to make a fool of me! I‚Äôve drunk plenty of black tea! There‚Äôs never been such a bitter one! ‚Äù The more Mo Lian spoke, the angrier she got. In her heart, she was already certain that Mo Yan was making a fool of her and that those supervisors were mocking her. Thinking about how she had actually embarrassed herself in front of Mo Yan, a wave of anger burned straight to her brain. Suddenly, she stood up, picked up the teacup, and threw it at Mo Yan. Mo Yan had long been prepared for her overreaction. The moment the teacup was thrown at her, she stood up and dodged. Her eyes that were filled with frost were staring straight at Mo Lian. The others were also shocked by Mo Lian‚Äôs sudden action and stood up in unison. At that moment, the director couldn‚Äôt hold it in any longer and asked with a frown, ‚ÄúMs. Mo, what do you mean by this? ‚Äù ‚ÄúDirector, your employee has been disrespectful to your guest, and you still want to protect her? Do you not want to cooperate anymore? ‚Äù (truncated)",,112,"{'like_count': 98, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 77830}",Feather's Stories,,2023-10-07 15:23:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/263277601_428184322082925_8055429510607946629_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ZnFJvtkOmeQAX9sQbF2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAr9oaSqSNCWrB205pSRQS8oXXhTah8DYkhIhHJl7jFFA&oe=6559A48D,https://www.facebook.com/100046740830696/posts/845657057002314,

Her travels have inspired her to capture life with photography. What started off as a hobby, capturing special moments of her time around new cities and environments eventually evolved into a career she never foresaw coming. This very passion drove her to use the camera to express and deliver narratives previously unseen and untold. For her, photography became more than a way of creating memories. Photography has been a tremendous support for Callie and It has been a refuge for Callie during difficult times and a safe space to explore a multitude of emotions concerning love, conflict, and hope. Callie‚Äôs works mostly refer to life ‚ÄúIn the moment‚Äù. She captures people to reveal honesty and express the authenticity of their individuality, heritage, and life. The raw power of her images makes us want to know more about the subjects, their life, and their personal stories. ARTIST STATEMENT For me photography was a life-saver. It picked me up at a difficult time in my life and I have not let it go ever since. Originally from Malaysia, I have lived in various countries and I am now based in Switzerland. Photography has changed my view of the world and has made me see things differently.

facebook,"Shika is an adorable 4 yo sable female Shepherd who was slightly underweight at 65 lbs. She has gained some weight and is perfect now. Found as a stray, we do not know the details of her upbringing. What we can say is that she holds no grudges about the past or worries about tomorrow, as she has an amazing talent to adapt to life around her. From day one, this gal was ready to make friends with people and other canines at a large social event (possibly she knew they were the guests of honor). Hustle and bustle of strangers do not seem to disturb her steady centered self. She readily accepted pets and adorations of her endearing floppy ear. The company of her co-foster (see Amaretto) helped her to make sense of the fun, but she did well on her own among a multitude of volunteers. Shika does very well when greeting other dogs and will try her best to maintain order and peace among her pack. Her demeanor with other canines is generally submissive with a touch of ‚Äúwanna play?‚Äù. Objects such as toys or nyla bones are objects to promote chase, but not a source of conflict among her trusted pack mates. Her energy is mid-level and she will opt to come inside often to rest, especially during the summer heat. This girl enjoys daily walks and is learning to keep a forward motion with the help of her canine cohorts. Other dogs peak her interest on the walk, but she does not display any reaction other than forgetting to continue forward. When it comes to car rides, she hesitates when loading in a vehicle but will accept assistance without protest. Once she is in the car, she lays calmly through the entire ride. Slowly this is improving as she learns this is likely a ticket to a fun-filled adventure! Shika settles like an angel in the home, often choosing to lay close to her human on the floor. She does have a mischievous desire to ‚Äòrearrange‚Äô personal belongings, such as shoes, clothes, or linens that happen to be lonely. If she discovers a laundry basket unattended, she will gladly help move some items to plain view, like to the hallway or outdoor lawn. Most often, she will leave them there quietly for you to retrieve‚Ä¶and fold. Shika is housebroken and is accustomed to using a dog door. She does well with the company of another dog if her foster mom is at work. At night, she willingly enters her crate where she sleeps quietly through the night. This is a special gal who makes very little demands and offers solid devoted companionship without a fuss. Cats and small critters unknown.

It highlights Mary's capacity to assist and guide believers through life's challenges as her intercession is especially powerful due to her closeness to her son, Jesus Christ. This title's historical importance is notably tied to the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 when Pope Pius V called on the faithful to seek Mary's intercession through the Rosary. The resulting victory was attributed to her, cementing the association of ""Our Lady of Victory"" with triumph over adversity. Throughout history, Mary has been a source of hope, courage, and divine help for those facing struggles, whether physical, spiritual, or moral.

We condemn today‚Äôs brazen attack on civilians, wanton violence against women and children, and hostage taking of innocent bystanders. Along with all freedom and peace-loving Iranians who seek cooperation and coexistence rather than conflict with our neighbors, we offer our sincere condolences to the victims and their families.

Make no mistake, Israel is being attacked by the same forces of extremism and poisonous ideology that have been taking our once prosperous and progressive region back to the dark ages. 

The Islamic Republic‚Äôs support of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups is undeniable. That regime officials in Tehran celebrated today‚Äôs sad news is further proof that they have no compunction about supporting terror and violence against civilians‚Ä¶.

Saudi Arabia also urged the international community to initiate a peace process leading to a two-state solution.

‚ÄúThe Kingdom is closely following developments in the unprecedented situation between a number of Palestinian factions and the Israeli occupation forces, which has resulted in a high level of violence taking place on a number of fronts there,‚Äù the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to the official news agency, SPA.

Qatar, which has been starkly opposed to normalisation with Israel, expressed ""deep concern"" over the developments in the Gaza Strip.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Israel was ""solely responsible for the ongoing escalation due to its continuous violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, including its recent repeated intrusions into the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque under the protection of the Israeli police"".

instagram,"GAZA: At least 198 people were killed in Gaza on Saturday, the health ministry in the Palestinian enclave said, after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets into Israel which responded with air strikes.

The ministry said up until 4:20 pm (1320 GMT) there were ‚Äú198 martyrs and 1,610 wounded with different injuries‚Äù in the conflict.

Earlier in the day, Palestinian group Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel in years, killing at least 100 people and claiming it had taken dozens of hostages in a surprise assault combining gunmen crossing into Israel and a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza.

Mohammad Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight, Reuters reported.

This is a non-negotiable human rights call that inherently refuses the ongoing human rights violations of an entire people whilst purposefully erasing our identity as a way to sacrifice not only a region but people, land, culture for the benefit of the Global North, for a vague idea of ‚Äúpeace‚Äù barricaded behind barbwires of torture and exploitation. 

This isn‚Äôt a debate, or a conflict nor is it complicated‚Äîthis is a colonial expansion and apartheid justified and protected by media, policies and a broken educational system that continues to dehumanize Palestinian people while allowing human rights violations and war crimes to persist.

The situation today is not a surprise attack, it isn‚Äôt an uncalled terrorist attack when the very people subjugated in an open air prison are reclaiming their freedom. 

I will not be debating the fact that Palestine and Palestinians deserve to be free now. Enough is enough. Khallas.

instagram,"On October 6, 1973, 50 years ago, war broke out in Israel. This war was known as the Yom Kippur War and started as a surprise attack during the holiest of Jewish holidays. Once again this morning, surprise attacks came from Hamas during the celebration of a Jewish holiday. Innocent people have been killed, Hamas terrorists have captured dozens of Israelis, including soldiers, and there is no end in sight to this conflict.

This is not a moment to turn away. This is a moment to get educated about what is going on. This is a moment to check on your friends in Israel, to check in with your Jewish friends (no matter where they live), and to speak up.

Here is data for just a 12 year time frame.

Decades old oppression by TeœÄœÄorist Israel, kiIIng innocent Palestinians is a Social Service.

While the Retaliation of Palestinians, fight for their freedom & basic Human Rights is TeœÄœÄorism.

Let That Sink in.

There is no ""both sides"" argument:

~Only Palestinians live under military occupation

~Only Palestinians have homes stolen for illegal Israeli settlements

~Only Palestinians are being dispossessed

~Only Palestinians face apartheid laws

ALL of this is done by one side: Israel.

The west is all about #FreeUkraine üá∫üá¶ but when it comes to #FreePalestine üáµüá∏ they call the retaliation & resistance, terrorism?

Their hypocrisy has no bounds. Alhamdulillah it‚Äôs open for the world to see. May Allah protect our brothers & sisters in Palestine from harms way Ameen

instagram,"üá∏üá¶ Egypt and Saudi Arabia called on Saturday for an immediate halt to the ongoing clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians.

Saudi Arabia also urged the international community to initiate a peace process leading to a two-state solution.

‚ÄúThe Kingdom is closely following developments in the unprecedented situation between a number of Palestinian factions and the Israeli occupation forces, which has resulted in a high level of violence taking place on a number of fronts there,‚Äù the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to the official news agency, SPA.

Qatar, which has been starkly opposed to normalisation with Israel, expressed ""deep concern"" over the developments in the Gaza Strip.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Israel was ""solely responsible for the ongoing escalation due to its continuous violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, including its recent repeated intrusions into the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque under the protection of the Israeli police"".

instagram,"Which do you resonate with? Share in the comments üëáüèº

üåüOver-responsible people are people-pleasers who suppress and repress themselves to prioritise others and to minimise or eliminate conflict, criticism, rejection, disappointment and loss. They often do good things for the wrong reasons because they don't know of another way of cope (we can unlearn this way of being). 

ü´∂üèºThere are many reasons why we learn to become over responsible which I share on the Mindset Shift course - the link is in my bio for more information. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Here are a few tips to remember:
1) Set your boundaries! Boundaries are where we begin and another person ends.
2) Boundaries are about YOU and your needs.
3) You can't change other people.
4) You get to decide what you're willing to put up with.
5) Don't stress over someone's negative response, we do not have control over how they react and we are not going to be liked by everyone.

üß® Note: Instagram is not a substitute for therapy. See disclaimer in highlights.

üåüKeep shining your light.

Over and out.

instagram,"To be clear: This does not mean we let kids ""run wild"" with zero structure, boundaries, or guidance from a well-regulated adult. I'm not saying we don't step in and offer the appropriate support and values-based rules to help our children treat themselves and others with care and respect. 

What I am saying is the foundation for all of this starts with us. If we can't regulate ourselves in the heat of the moment or in the midst of conflict, how can we expect that of our kids? I have to remind myself of that all the time. It's SO hard. If it's hard for you, please know you're not alone. 

This is humbling work and some days it's really confusing and overwhelming. Deep breath. You are doing GREAT. You don't have to be perfect. We're all figuring it out as we go and I'm so grateful to be learning together in this wonderful community we've co-created.

instagram,"At least 198 people have been killed and around 1600 people are injured in the heavy bombardment by Israel in Gaza following the surprise strike by Hamas on Saturday morning that shocked the world.

Journalists and activists from Gaza say the number is feared to rise in the coming hours.

Bombing is expected to intensify as Palestinian fighters have caused major damage to the Jewish state. In response to the strike by Palestinian fighters, Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared ‚Äúwar‚Äù.

In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of conflict ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.

The Israeli government has confirmed that the number of Israelis killed has risen to at least 40. Several Israelis are captured and taken to Gaza.

Meanwhile Hamas deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri said the group is ready for ‚Äúthe worst case scenario‚Äù.

‚ÄúAll scenarios are now possible and we are ready for an [Israeli] land invasion,‚Äù he added.

He has told Al Jazeera that the group has captured ‚Äúa big number‚Äù of Israelis.

He said ‚Äúsenior officers‚Äù were among them.

On Saturday morning, Hamas fighters fired a barrage of rockets into Israel while launching an incursion from land, air and sea.

In the first three to four hours of the assault, dozens of Palestinians managed to reach deep into Israeli territory. They have captured a large number of Israeli soldiers, including commanders, and taken them back to Gaza. They have also taken over parts of Israeli towns near Gaza, as well as an important army base and other military facilities.

Following that, the Israeli army began a massive wave of air strikes targeting various parts of Gaza.

The death tolls on both sides are expected to rise and there are fears violence will spill into other parts of Israel and Palestine.

SERUAN MUNAJAT UNTUK AL-AQSA

1. PAS mengikuti secara dekat pertempuran yang berlaku antara Palestin dan Israel yang bermula pada hari ini. Serangan besar-besaran telah dilancarkan oleh HAMAS dan Jihad Islami dalam 'Operasi Taufan Al-Aqsa' selepas berlakunya ketegangan selama beberapa minggu di sempadan Gaza-Israel.

2. Saya menyeru kepada seluruh umat Islam untuk menunaikan solat hajat, membaca doa qunut nazilah dan bermunajat untuk saudara Islam kita di bumi Gaza, serta mengadakan 'Himpunan Solidariti bersama al-Quds' sebagai bantahan terhadap tindakan zalim Israel yang merampas tanah bumi Palestin.

PAS President's Media Statement

URGENT CALL TO PRAY FOR AL-AQSA

1. PAS is closely monitoring the escalating conflict between Palestine and Israel that erupted today. Following several weeks of heightened tension along the Gaza-Israel border, Hamas and Jihad Islami launched a large-scale offensive named 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.'

2. I earnestly urge all Muslims to engage in hajat prayer, recite the qunut nazilah supplication, and make dua for our Muslim brothers and sisters in Gaza. Let us also convene a 'Solidarity Gathering for al-Quds' as a strong protest against Israel's oppressive actions, which continue to infringe upon Palestinian territory.

Remember, Al-Quds rightfully belongs to the Muslim community.

instagram,"Pay attention to how the zionist propaganda machine and the western media will attempt to divert from the colonial reality of ethnic cleansing taking place by painting Palestinians as the main aggressors‚Äî hyper-fixating on their actions yet never scrutinizing Israeli atrocities.

Biden has already announced a $8 billion package to *aid* Israel in what will surely be an unprecedented retaliation to today's emphatic operation. To further pulverize one of the most densely populated areas and youngest population in the world which Israel already keeps blockaded illegally from the land, air and sea; where 9 out of 10 Palestinian children suffer from some form of conflict related post-traumatic stress disorder because of constant Israeli violence; where that trauma is unending and constant. 

But the damage has already been done, the dye has been cast‚Äî the illegality of their state has been exposed, their powerlessness in the face of those whom they oppress has been exposed. The fact that the Israeli state's existence necessitates the eradication of Palestinian people in order for it to function‚Äî that it can't abandon this purpose, has never been clearer. The normalizers and their collaborators were planning for a future that further betrays and invisiblizes Palestinians; they have stamped their right today‚Äî that the final say will be theirs.

Mainstream discourse will again make sure to contextualize Israeli actions in a rational, probable sense. But for the Palestinians whose right to life it violates, their retaliation to that violence imposed upon them will be unrelentingly criticized and deemed unjustifiable by all measures, as it already has been. They will present what is the result of structural genocide and systematic ethnic cleansing as barbaric violence when it is very much the byproduct of what the Zionist entity inflicts upon Palestinians every day. Their retaliation is inevitable; and it is justified by International law.

They seem to perfectly understand this self-determination within the context of Ukrainians resisting a Russian invasion yet they can't rationalize the same thing conceptually when it comes to Palestine.",,4735,"{'like_count': 4682, 'comment_count': 53, 'num_users': 23569}",Dialectic | ÿ≠ŸäÿØÿ±,,2023-10-07 20:23:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/343420991_1437621160391879_3856372823849496834_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=q7WC83TaKIAAX85F_d2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCrcRWoSVj80jKywYeFaj7cVj1sh7fCJXX-Ppup1iO9SQ&oe=655A1E6B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHGGYignPY/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386463764_668680638694292_6899640153477487099_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=eKj6USXHJ_sAX-1-6Hf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDTLXf_wGtlmQqTkjicIWKpZNzYHUaFeuH5VD79A4BF0Q&oe=655A0AD6

instagram,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has affirmed the United States' unwavering support for Israel following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's declaration of war against Palestinian militants. Austin stated that the U.S. stands firmly by Israel and will ensure it has the necessary support to defend itself and protect civilians from violence and terrorism. 

The U.S. has been a staunch ally of Israel, providing approximately $3.8 billion in aid to the country annually. The declaration of war came after Palestinian militant groups, particularly Hamas, launched a surprise multi-frontal attack inside Israel, resulting in over 2,000 missiles being fired and multiple infiltrations across the border.

The conflict has led to significant casualties, with at least 100 Israeli deaths reported by Israel's national rescue service. The U.S. government, including White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, has condemned the violence and engaged in discussions with counterparts regarding the situation. This escalation comes amid longstanding tensions between Palestine and Israel, intensifying in recent months due to contentious policies under Netanyahu's far-right government concerning Palestinian communities.

In 2003, the US, UK and other countries also invaded Iraq, and the War on Terror expanded to other countries, including Pakistan, Syria and Yemen.
At the time of writing (October 2023), this ongoing conflict has led to an estimated death toll of at least 4.5 million, according to researchers at Brown University.

instagram,"There's a global, fast-growing population of people without a religion. That's according to a new AP-NORC Poll.‚Å†
‚Å†
By the numbers: 3 in 10 U.S. adults said they had no religious affiliation.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚Ä¢ About half of them identify as atheist or agnostic, and the other half say their religion is ""nothing in particular.""‚Å†
‚Å†
The shift away from religion is even starker among younger adults, with 43% of 18- to 29-year-old Americans responding ""none,"" when asked which religion they follow.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚Ä¢ But fewer than 20% of U.S. adults over 60 are ""nones.""‚Å†

The trend is gaining momentum across the world, AP reports from several countries:‚Å†
‚Å†
‚Ä¢ In Japan, 70% of people in Japan say they have nonreligious feelings.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚Ä¢ Nearly 80% of Italians say they're Catholic. But most view it as a tradition, with fewer than 20% attending services weekly.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚Ä¢ Israel, a country with about 7 million Jews, is remarkably nonreligious: Just 33% said they practiced ""traditional"" religious worship. Conflict between secular and ultra-religious Israelis has grown in recent years.‚Å†

instagram,"In veneration of the new works by Delcy Morelos.  Now at @diaartfoundation in New York. Maravillosas fotos de Juana Berr√≠os Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @juana_berrio My heart is full today. It‚Äôs always so meaningful to see someone you love shine out in the world, especially when their light touches others in deep ways too. 

El Abrazo (The Embrace) at Dia Chelsea. I could not be prouder of her. 

Without providing any instructions, her work invites us to slow down, speak with a soft voice‚Äîor refrain from speaking at all‚Äîand sharpen our senses so we can carefully notice what is immediately around us. As a result, my posture changed and I found myself moving around the earth-made works with a temple-like disposition of reverence. 

When walking through the rooms where Cielo Terrenal and El Abrazo are, I felt again in my body the pain held by countless images of mass graves, disappeared people and hundreds of thousands of stories of victims of the Colombian armed conflict. I also felt in my skin the memory of something I don‚Äôt often have the chance to identify with: the earth. Once I started to be reminded that I was a tiny particle of it all, it was impossible not to be profoundly moved. 
This reminded me of the magical day we spent with @ceciliavicuna (pictured here) accompanied by @bluegallo_keys at @organizmo_ last year. There were healing tears that day too as we honored the earth, our ancestors, and the important work done by so many land and water defenders, especially indigenous peoples. 

As the earth, our big house, our mother, keeps getting seriously wounded and we continue becoming disconnected from it at a very fast pace, Delcy‚Äôs work reminds us that the memory of the earth and many important ancestral histories, still live within us too.  @diaartfoundation #darkearth #terrapreta #earth #soil #earthworks #earthprotectors #temple #ceciliavicu√±a",,3821,"{'like_count': 3795, 'comment_count': 26, 'num_users': 67333}",Cecilia VicunÃÉa,,2023-10-07 22:09:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11376222_1146737998673592_2037267200_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9a4dgx51vyQAX9maQw6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfByBsDf2NB3B2a8NgIe6I2zX31X7jXk32p6KUqoX9Au4g&oe=655AEE82,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHSQecO-fF/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386458883_1052677336084369_3175447841398754194_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=vY8PJVTUQwUAX8zUked&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBLrb5bL1NkUfIiuji7a2CpjShN3z4hUKFnxRbvG3nbgA&oe=654147AE

instagram,"With 5,590 innocent civilian deaths in 12 years - how could the current escalation by Palestinians be ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù? 

With myriad homes destroyed in these years - how could this be an ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù attack? 

With children witnessing their parents and parents seeing their children/toddlers dying in front of them - how could this be an ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù attack? 

With multiple attacks of Israel on Palestinians,  killing hundreds and injuring thousands in each eruption - how could this be an ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù attack? 

Every time a mother loses her kid, a daughter loses her father and countless tragedies - how could the people on social media tag Palestinians as ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù? 

Defending their homeland brutally snatched from them, and then having the will to resist and stand in the face of tyranny - how could they be ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù? 

With every human rights organisation denouncing attacks on Palestinians and occupation of their land - how could then they be ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù? 

Humanity dies every time it comes to vicious interests - it died another death today because of venom spewing leaders and politicians. 

It has transpired in the past; it is happening now, and this will occur in the future. 

No innocent citizen deserves to die, may it be Palestinian or Israeli. War-mongering is a cancer that engulfs nations and buries humanity.

Palestine doesn't only belong to Muslims. It‚Äôs not a conflict between Muslims and Jews, which the media and politicians try to portray to malign Islam as a religion. 

Palestine belongs to Christians residing there, and it belongs to Jews living there. It is a conflict between Palestine and Israel, not between Muslims and Jews. Whoever says otherwise does so to reduce it to religious hatred and deflect from the purpose. 

The last time I checked, every state has the right to defend itself. Yes, it shouldn‚Äôt have happened. No civilians should have died. But it has been happening, and it will keep happening until Palestinians get their beloved home back. 

I see the same politicians and world leaders in deaf, mute and blind mode when it comes to the rights of Palestinians.

Title: Through Blood and Dragons: Epic Fantasy (The Forged and The Fallen Book 1)
Author: R.M. Schultz

Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (5/5)

Through Blood and Dragons: Epic Fantasy, the first book in The Forged and The Fallen series by R.M. Schultz, is an enthralling and immersive journey into the world of Cimeren. With a captivating storyline, well-developed characters, and a richly detailed world, this book deserves a solid five-star rating.

The story takes place in a divided world, where a mysterious forest and the vast Lake on Fire separate the kingdoms. Chaos looms in the south as battles and quarrels between kingdoms escalate. In the midst of this turmoil, we follow the protagonist, Cyran Orendain, a squire of the dragonguard in the border outpost of Nevergrace.

Schultz masterfully portrays Cyran's emotional journey as he copes with personal loss and faces the challenges of his role. As the plot unfolds, secrets are revealed, and Cyran is drawn into a war that has been brewing for centuries. The concept of dragons as not only weapons but also engines of war adds a unique and intriguing aspect to the story.

The author's writing style is engaging and descriptive, effortlessly bringing the world of Cimeren to life. Schultz's attention to detail in crafting the settings, cultures, and political dynamics demonstrates a deep understanding of world-building. The pacing is well-balanced, keeping the reader hooked from start to finish.

The characters in Through Blood and Dragons are multi-dimensional and relatable. Cyran's growth and transformation throughout the narrative are beautifully portrayed, making him a compelling protagonist. The supporting cast also adds depth to the story, with their own arcs and motivations.

What truly sets this book apart is the sense of authenticity in the portrayal of emotions and the consequences of war. Schultz doesn't shy away from depicting the harsh realities of conflict, and the characters' vulnerability and resilience make the story all the more compelling.",,3248,"{'like_count': 3207, 'comment_count': 41, 'num_users': 107480}",A R N A V || üìö Book Club‚ù£Ô∏è,,2023-10-07 19:28:34,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/217285744_237370698204961_1710389132356537126_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=dhAKWuNRgq0AX-mDpwj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCKDVgAmcuK6xoPQGVlWcRZvjlaW_gmu2KFRG8Apq9F7Q&oe=655AE5FB,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyG_2fZhmBS/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386476886_337707182088135_3143468469192502180_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=R3Gy8i5T8ekAX--MQX-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAbksgLkzmmveQq_DsS6aAWZ82YUciWXcaE1OvkYSiEOA&oe=6558D27C

instagram,"Kerala‚Äôs Malabar region has a PR problem ‚Äî from Malappuram being called mini-Pakistan by Home Minister Amit Shah to Kannur being labelled one of India‚Äôs most politically violent districts. But in the last 10 years, Malabar has found new spokespersons. Directors, scriptwriters and producers are giving the region a makeover.

One of the biggest Malayalam hits of 2022, Thallumaala, is set in Malappuram. In the first fight of the film Wazim, played by Tovino Thomas is thrown into the mosque‚Äôs ablution tank, as the imam‚Äôs sermon plays in the background. The setting is undeniably Muslim, but the conflict is universal‚ÄîWasim placed his muddy shoes on the pristine white sneakers that belong to Jamshi, played by Lukman Avaran.

This blend of hyperlocal and universal has come to define Malayalam cinema‚Äôs new wave. Now there‚Äôs a new player on the block‚ÄîMalabar New Wave. The food, the language and the sartorial choices of Kerala‚Äôs Muslim-majority districts are now centre stage.

‚ÄúThere are two things that define the Malabar region‚Äîthe love for football and food,‚Äù says Zakariya. His debut film Sudani From Nigeria revolves around sevens football.

The Malabar region of Kerala‚ÄîPalakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, Kasargod, and Wayanad‚Äîhas the highest concentration of Muslims in the state. From Hijab to halal, bias to biryani, Islamophobia to identity, Malabar New Wave is a powerful antidote to The Kerala Story phenomenon. While the number of big releases can be counted on one‚Äôs fingers their impact has not just created a subculture but also disrupted the industry.

instagram,"In a statement, the Foreign Office (FO) underscored the urgent need for a ceasefire and a return to peaceful negotiations. ‚ÄúWe are closely monitoring the unfolding situation in the Middle East and the eruption of hostilities between Israel and Palestinians,‚Äù the Foreign Office Spokesperson said in a press release.  Pakistan has consistently advocated for a two-state solution as the key to enduring peace in the Middle East, with a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian question anchored in international law and in line with relevant United Nations and OIC resolutions. 

‚ÄúA viable, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine should be established on the basis of pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,‚Äù it was reiterated.  Pakistan also called on the international community to come together for cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and for a lasting peace in the region.

instagram,"Buffalo Bills fans will be up early for this weekend‚Äôs game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. It will kick off live from London at 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.

The overseas kick created two dilemmas for Bills Mafia. Both of them have been solved.

Current New York state laws prohibit restaurants and bars from serving alcohol between 4:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on Sundays. That would normally mean that Buffalo fans could not enjoy the NFL‚Äòs International Series game with an ice cold beer at a bar or restaurant during the first 30 minutes of the game. No pregame either. They could have as many drinks as they want at home, but not out in public.

Gov. Kathy Hochul got ahead of that issue.

With the Buffalo Bills playing across the pond on Sunday morning, I know fans will be gathering for the big game & may fancy a pint.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm directing the State Liquor Authority to extend the deadline for special permits, so sports bars & restaurants can serve as early as 8am. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô‚Äù

One problem solved!

The other problem that comes with a game before 10:00 a.m. is specific to those of Christian faith. Church services on Sunday will conflict with kickoff. Bills Mafia would struggle to get in a sermon and get a buzz before or even during the game.

This is where the Tavern at Windsor Park in Williamsville, NY is stepping up. It‚Äôs holding church in the bar before kickoff.

Pastor Steve Biegner from St. Paul Lutheran Church in Eggertsville will lead the service at 8:30 a.m., and it will last exactly 30 minutes before the tailgate begins at 9:00 a.m. Kickoff at 9:30 a.m.

‚ÄúWe want to make sure we try and meet people where they‚Äôre going to be. We don‚Äôt always need to be in a sanctuary. This can be our sanctuary on a Sunday morning with some great fellowship and prayer together‚Äù 

via WGRZ

Biegner is not the only local pastor who is taking an innovative approach to game day. St. John‚Äôs Lutheran Church in Williamsville cancelled all of its traditional services for Sunday.

Instead, they are going to hold a ‚Äútailgate church‚Äù at 8:30 a.m. in the parking lot followed by a watch party. In lieu of the alter, the pastor will use the tailgate of a truck.",,2721,"{'like_count': 2694, 'comment_count': 27, 'num_users': 486528}",BroBible.com,,2023-10-07 20:49:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/50598038_2244882689113744_4287930571906088960_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=gYmCxCPXXawAX_koPjg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAyVTI0db2JKkti4UeQv2xWfa9DZUOEKxWgoUoZIhEBHA&oe=6559CE51,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHJHXiyVjS/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386759921_999177384474015_2825145217882416952_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Qll2MdavPZYAX81u6n2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB8g43fVOr8nHpzINMuJTWf5V9kH7r_UKs15R1d7PupZA&oe=65319BB2

instagram,"Hamas' Qassam Brigades initiated the aggression, particularly regarding the Holy Al Aqsa Mosque and Palestinian prisoners. Rocket attacks from Gaza have caused casualties enumerating hundreds. The Palestinian Al Quds Brigades reportedly captured Israeli soldiers, heightening tensions.

The Israeli response with airstrikes in Gaza has led to powerful explosions, damaging densely populated areas and turning the buildings into rubble. Israel declared a ""state of readiness"" for war, escalating the conflict.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights calls for an ""immediate stop"" to violence in Israel. The international community closely monitors the conflict, urging a peaceful resolution and emphasising human rights protection, particularly concerning the treatment of hostages which include women and children.

instagram,"The Israeli National Security Council has Approved a Ground Operations to begin in the Gaza Strip.

There are also reports of a 'very high degree of probability' that Lebanon's Hezbollah is entering the war, although not confirmed. 

General update:
At least 70 people have been killed in Israel after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its biggest attack in years.

Militants crossed into Israel from Gaza under the cover of heavy rocket fire - and have since taken dozens of Israelis captive.

Some hostages - both soldiers and civilians - were taken back to Gaza.
Israel has responded with a wave of air strikes on targets in Gaza killing 198 people, Palestinian officials say.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ""at war"" and vowed that Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, will ""pay a price it has never known"".

""This morning Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the state of Israel and its citizens,"" he said in a video address.

This is one of the most serious escalations in the Israel-Palestinian conflict in years.

The attack by Hamas saw fighters cross the perimeter fence at just after dawn. At the same time, barrages of rockets were launched from Gaza - some reaching as far as the cities of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem

How the gunmen managed to penetrate one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world is unclear.

The Israeli military has said that dozens of fighter jets are carrying out air strikes on Hamas sites in Gaza, and it has hit 17 Hamas military compounds. It also said it has mobilised tens of thousands of reservists.

The Palestinian health ministry says 198 people have been killed in Israeli strikes. and another 1,610 have been wounded. Medical aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres said a nurse and an ambulance driver were killed in Israeli strikes on two hospitals in Gaza.

The outbreak of conflict follows months of surging violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with fatalities in the occupied West Bank hitting a scale not seen in years.

instagram,"Sometimes the biggest problem in a child custody case is the other parent, whose narcissistic behaviors are out of control.  In practice what I find is that many times it is also the lawyer representing the other parent that is creating a significant number of problems in a case. 

I routinely see family lawyers fueling conflict for nothing other than their own gains.  I see families getting screwed over by their attorneys as a common practice.  I frequently deal with attorneys who seem to have no problem standing in front of the court and flat out lying about the family members involved‚Ä¶or engaging in needless high-conflict procedures that seem to accomplish nothing other than running up a huge bill. 

The perfect storm is when these conscience-less birds of a feather find one another and literally feed off of each other‚Äôs creation of conflict. 

How have you seen these dynamics play out in your own case?

Saturday‚Äôs incident marked an unprecedented infiltration by Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and was the most serious escalation since Israel and Hamas fought a 10-day war in 2021.

Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of conflict ahead.

Hamas military commander Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.

instagram,"üáµüá∞ Pakistan Saturday expressed concerns over the latest Palestine-Israel conflict which Israel has now declared war on Gaza. 

""We are closely monitoring the unfolding situation in the Middle East and the eruption of hostilities between Israel and Palestinians,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement.

""We are concerned about the human cost of the escalating situation,"" the Foreign Office said, calling upon the international community to join hands to end the hostilities.

The ministry's statement added that the world powers should ""come together for cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and for a lasting peace in the Middle East"".

Pakistan has consistently advocated for a two-state solution as the key to enduring peace in the Middle East, with a just, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Palestinian question anchored in international law and in line with relevant United Nations and OIC resolutions.

instagram,"This triggers the cue for stress more than anything else. Do you know what it is? 

Uncertainty. 

Your nervous system's inability to mentally, emotionally, and physiologically know what to expect following triggers our systems into fight or flight more than anything else. 

The issue here is that our nervous system will directly avoid and complicate the solution to our pain through avoidance and disconnect. 

Why would it not? 

Face fear or pretend like it doesn't exist? 

Uhhh yes I'll take cookies and ice cream instead of that dry kale salad all day thank you. 

However, the short term relief that comes from avoiding has consequences. 

It's not like it just goes away, that problem compounds in the vacuum of the mind one theory to why is that we operate based upon ""the negativity bias"". 

This states that our nervous system learns more from negative experiences than positive ones. Survival of the fittest is also the survival of the fastest to adapt which means those who are easily triggered into stress, according to evolution, have an advantage. 

Or at least they did. 

Now that the ancient system holds back more businesses from success and people from purpose-driven lives than anything else. 

We avoid the cure for our own poisoning. 

But how is it that some days we can confront the fear and other days it seems impossible? 

Resources. 

Your system takes inventory on your mental, emotional and energetic resources. 

If you just ran a marathon then running another one is not something your system is interested in. (this included emotional marathons as well) 

Self-regulation systems to allow you to be in a state that allows you to confront fear and leverage the education that life's stressors are trying to give you is a sustainable path to relieving burnout, self-sabotage and more. 

Phase 1: get clarity around what you need to confront. 

Phase 2: Lean in. Community and accountability to the standards of a person you want to be are the best ways to support this.

instagram,"Your parents' emotional volatility left you constantly walking on eggshells, always cautious not to make them angry or upset. 

To keep the peace, you learned to suppress your own needs and emotions, because any conflict could result in an emotional explosion.

As an adult, this pain translates into overwhelming resentment, fear, and hypervigilance. Your nervous system is so accustomed to chaos and unpredictability that relaxing and feels like an insurmountable task.

And it‚Äôs no wonder this fear is gearing up as we approach the holidays - your body likely knows what‚Äôs coming. 

Specializing in treating the adult children of emotionally immature parents for over five years, I've seen the lasting wounds this parenting style inflicts. Frankly, there's a glaring gap in the literature on how to treat these issues, leaving survivors without the resources they need or with therapists who don't fully grasp the lived experience of growing up with such a parent. This reality is exactly why I study the emotionally immature parent in my doctoral research - so more scientific literature can exist to demonstrate to survivors that you aren‚Äôt making it all up and that it‚Äôs not in your head. (A common belief system that many adult children hold).

Share with me below, what did your EIP consider ‚Äònormal‚Äô that was actually incredibly toxic?

instagram,"Tell me below - can you relate and what would you add to the list?

I want to use this post to offer self-compassion.

What is self-compassion? Instead of criticism, which so many of us get stuck in, compassion says to treat ourselves the same way we would a dear friend.

We wouldn't say to a friend, ‚Äòwhy are you struggling in your relationship? Move on. It's not that bad.‚Äô

You would say, ‚ÄòThis is hard for you. This is a really hard season. I see you in this time and I want you to know you are not alone in this.‚Äô

Struggling in never-ending conflict now that baby is here?

‚¨á Here is my offering today.

1. Bring to mind that this is a moment of struggle. This is a hard season. It is painful. ‚ÄòThis is a moment of suffering. This is a hard moment.‚Äô

2. Bring common humanity to this experience. ‚ÄòAll people struggle in their relationships in some way. I am not alone in my experience.‚Äô

3. Say something kind to yourself, just like you would a dear friend. ‚ÄòYou are learning to be kind to yourself. You are doing your best‚Äô

*these three key elements are from @neffselfcompassion and her research on self-compassion

instagram,"As Israel counts the cost of Hamas‚Äô surprise attack, Bibi Netanyahu should not be shocked if it includes his leadership.‚Å†
‚Å†
The sudden and massive attack unleashed by Hamas against Israel on Saturday has its roots in a long history of conflict. It may seem to echo past attacks. But it is very different in several key respects.‚Å†
‚Å†
First, it is by far the most complex attack orchestrated by Hamas against Israel in its history. Secondly, it caught Israel completely unaware and, in many respects, unprepared. In fact, it represents the biggest Israeli intelligence failure in at least half a century. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Finally, while Israelis and the world were justifiably outraged at Hamas‚Äô brutality, the anger of millions of Israelis including many close to their security services was also directed at what was seen as the catastrophic mismanagement of Israeli national security by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his administration.‚Å†

instagram,"Woke up to the news of the vicious attack in Israel and I feel physically sick - literally gagging at the images I‚Äôve seen on social media.

To connect the dots: Palestinian militants are Hamas. Hamas is a huge terrorist organization and a proxy for Iran. The U.S. just gave Iran $6 billion in a hostage deal. Hamas suddenly has the weaponry to launch an offensive against Israel for the first time in a long time. These are the real life ramifications for a weak American foreign policy that does deals with terrorism.

Despite the disgusting rhetoric that has poured out of delusional radicals the past few years - know one thing to be very clear:

Many issues are complex and thorny. The Israel ‚Äúconflict‚Äù isn‚Äôt among them. America stands with our ally, against terror. Period. Rain hell on Hamas. 

Please pray hard for the people of Israel. Our most important and special global ally and the homeland of many people I love. There is no path but Zionism.

The Gaza blockade refers to the restrictions on the movement of people and goods imposed on the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian territory, by Israel and Egypt since 2007. It includes the presence of underwater barriers in the Mediterranean Sea to restrict maritime access. This blockade has had significant humanitarian consequences, limiting the flow of essential goods, including food, into Gaza. It has also affected the daily lives of the 2.2 million Palestinians living in the region, making it a contentious and complex issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Palestinians have very few rights there, and whenever they try to assert their rights, even in small matters, many Israelis often label them as terr*rists.

Israel, which was heavily involved in Artsakh's ethnic cleansing, perpetrated inhumane acts against fellow human beings. Now, it portrays itself as a victim, and the media often supports this narrative. 

It is extremely disappointing to see Armenian media portraying Palestinians as the main aggressors.

At the close of the joyous and celebratory ‚ÄòFeast of Tabernacles,‚Äô ‚ÄòSukkot,‚Äô an observance that prefigures a future of peace for the Jewish people  and among all nations, Israel is, suddenly, at war.

Fifty years ago, in 1973, on Yom Kippur, another Holy Day, the Jewish nation found herself, similarly, fighting for her survival. If ever there were a time to ‚ÄòPray for the Peace of Jerusalem‚Äô‚Äîit is now.

Jenny and I and our family join all of you in lifting up the land and people of Israel in light of this heinous attack from Hamas with, undoubtedly, the support of other enemies.

May America be a force for good and for God in this sudden assault‚Äîas we support the Middle East‚Äôs only true democracy. Even more, may the Lord God of Israel show us all how to pray and how to prepare for whatever this conflict may portend for our world.

As I write, my home is observing a day of remembrance for the passing of my Jewish mother, Florence Goetz; we add to that a prayer of mourning for those in Israel already killed and injured and for the safety and release of those taken hostage.

‚ÄòBaruch Haba B‚ÄôShem Adonai‚Äô- ‚ÄòBlessed is He who Comes in the Name of the Lord.‚Äô ‚ÄîMt. 23; Ps. 118
We never stop praying these words, as we wait and watch for ‚ÄòSar Shalom,‚Äô the ‚ÄòPrince of Peace‚Äô to come‚Äîand to finally bring His rule and reign of Shalom to Israel and to all the Earth.

Blessings and shalom to all of you,

You can‚Äôt just immediately accept the narrative being spoonfed to you by governments, intelligence agencies, and MSM like it‚Äôs the only objective truth that you accept without question. 

THEY ALL LIE CONSTANTLY. All governments. All militaries. All news organizations. They all lie as a point of baseline policy and have worked in lockstep together throughout the entire pandemic psyop, but now that it involves war and conflict in Israel, we just forget all that and go back to believing them?

What started is not just an operation, but a battle that will expand, escalate, and deepen.

The battle has a goal: the freedom of our people and the liberation of our sanctities. Therefore, the battle continues, escalates, until achieving the victory with the deserved freedom of our people.

We will not continue to accept accept the desecration of our sanctities, or the imprisonment of our prisoners in jails, or the continued siege of Gaza.

What we have in our hands will free all the prisoners from the occupation jails.

There is a large number of ""israeli"" captives, and there are senior officers among the captives. The battle is still at its peak, and the freedom of our captives in prisons is imminent.

We captured senior officers from the occupation army, and we will capture more until the prisons are emptied.

The resistance is prepared for the worst scenarios, including a ground invasion. An ""israeli"" ground invasion would be the best scenario for us to settle the conflict against the enemy.

We have information that the occupation army was preparing, after the holidays, to launch a major aggression against our people in the West Bank and Gaza. The battle is coming, and the aggression began with the desecration of the sanctities and the enemy's intention to attack Gaza and the West Bank.

We are ready to defend the dignity and freedom of our people.

We hope that the resistance will cover all of Palestinian land, and God willing, there will be effective solidarity and a strong stance from both the Arab and Muslim nations.",,1183,"{'like_count': 1144, 'comment_count': 39, 'num_users': 25990}",GPM - Josh,,2023-10-07 14:15:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/278718510_403954938226843_6582434099674142120_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=8VCHC1XwDsQAX98RJl4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDyJjaD0w7ypei8pKUIAkAeInkZTC-vPuT-Lewd47lLVw&oe=655A5BBD,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGcE0BuK5r/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386628106_341871071623430_4860620025194113411_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4wEKHeevfoAAX8zJpUq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBdMf8QYRupIRalNZ7dYZDCG1lP7VeB4ZLwv90DIOyuvQ&oe=6532BE9A

Die ‚ÄûStorm Z‚Äú-Kader seien f√ºr das russische Verteidigungsministerium n√ºtzlich, weil sie als entbehrliche Infanterie eingesetzt werden k√∂nnen, sagte die in Russland gegr√ºndete, unabh√§ngige Organisation Conflict Intelligence Team der Nachrichtenagentur.

Str√§flinge bildeten laut dem Bericht den Kern der Strafkommandos, aber auch einige regul√§re Soldaten wurden als Strafe f√ºr Disziplinverst√∂√üe den Einheiten zugewiesen.

Adulting encompasses more than just the maturation of our brains. It's a holistic journey that involves mastering the art of stress management, fine-tuning our ability to regulate the nervous system, and becoming adept at resolving conflicts. This path to true adulthood is not solely defined by cognitive growth but also by emotional intelligence and practical life skills. It's about navigating the complex terrain of responsibilities and challenges, equipping ourselves with the tools needed to face life's hurdles head-on, and emerging as resilient and capable individuals.

instagram,"It‚Äôs sad to see that we are once again seeing a conflict in which civilians have been the primary target and/or ones under the direct fire.

A group like Hamas targeting only civilian sectors with their initial operations shows their degraded morality as an organization and sets back any legitimacy they had.

Seeing military generals authorize the use of cluster bombings within civilian sectors of Gaza also showcases the lack of strategic and moral thinking from the Israeli military‚Äôs leadership.

These moves repeat and repeat and repeat whenever their is escalation in clashes, and there has yet to be any change in approach nor strategy by anyone to pursue other paths of strategy. 

The conflict stems from a long history of complex relations, in which can boater strong feelings from both sides of the situation regarding the current clashes.
With strong emotional feelings can come community support & growth and the expression of passion, but also with this approach comes what has been playing out for decades now. An extremely polarized conflict that showcases no overlap in cooperation which leads to a never ending conflict.

This conflict has continuously led to a disproportionate number of civilians facing the primary consequences of the war while soldiers on both sides are exploited via conscription and/or nationalistic upbringings by the hands of incompetent leaders and strategists. Soldiers in nearly every conflict in history are just civilians being used by the powerful incompetent. They do not deserve this devastation either. 

I know many of my followers from from both Israel and Palestine (or have deep rooted connections to) and I hope all of your families and yourselves remain safe and sound in these times.

instagram,"STOP SHAMIMG PARENTS ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

One of the things so many in my community struggle with is parenting with a narcissist. Their abuser!!! 

When we have a society that tells us 'co parenting is best for the child‚Äô and when other couples who have divorced that CAN co parent, this then leaves the person who was abused by the narcissist feeling like a failure.

I must be a bad parent
I‚Äôm not good enough
I‚Äôm a failure

And these actually tap into the beliefs they are already thinking due to childhood worthiness wounds that led them to be in a relationship with a narcissist.

So this post is a plea for society to STOP trying to make people co parent with an abuser! Any child's greatest gift is a happy, healthy parent. If we force parents into having these fake relationships where it plays into the narcissists hands to further abuse and manipulate, this is actually the worst possible outcome.

A parent who PARALLEL PARENTS with a narcissist still has contact with the other parent but it is extremely modified to minimise conflict, very child centric and allows the person victimised by a narcissist, an abuser, to start to heal.

The best role model for a child is a happy and healthy parent who role models SELF LOVE, who installs confidence into their child to be good enough for simply being them SELF.

Let‚Äôs stop judging and start supporting our next generation of children by supporting their parents not shaming them ‚ù§Ô∏è

We condemn today‚Äôs brazen attack on civilians, wanton violence against women and children, and hostage taking of innocent bystanders. Along with all freedom and peace-loving Iranians who seek cooperation and coexistence rather than conflict with our neighbors, we offer our sincere condolences to the victims and their families.

Make no mistake, Israel is being attacked by the same forces of extremism and poisonous ideology that have been taking our once prosperous and progressive region back to the dark ages. 

The Islamic Republic‚Äôs support of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups is undeniable. That regime officials in Tehran celebrated today‚Äôs sad news is further proof that they have no compunction about supporting terror and violence against civilians‚Ä¶.

instagram,"What happened: Intense Rocket Barrage: Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip launched a significant barrage of rockets towards Israel, leading to the Israeli army declaring a ""state of readiness"" for war. Israel's Iron Dome defense system was able to intercept many of the rockets, although the attack resulted in casualties and prompted emergency measures.

Details: In response to the rocket attacks, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant authorized a large-scale reserve mobilization, along with the declaration of a state of emergency in anticipation of prolonged conflict. Sirens blared across multiple Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, with the Iron Dome air defense system activated in response. The Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced a rocket operation targeting enemy installations, airports, and military facilities. On the ground, clashes occurred between Palestinian factions and Israeli forces along the eastern Gaza Strip's border. Israel initiated airstrikes against Hamas targets within Gaza.

More: Palestinian factions launched rockets from various locations in Gaza, leading to casualties on both sides. While Israel's Iron Dome intercepted many rockets, the attack resulted in the deaths of at least 40 individuals and injuries to 750 others.
Sirens were sounded in multiple Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, with the activation of Israel's Iron Dome air defense system to counter the rocket attacks.

Also: The Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, announced their participation in the rocket operation, targeting enemy installations and military facilities. They claimed to have launched a substantial number of rockets within a short timeframe.
The situation remains highly volatile and continues to evolve, with both parties engaged in hostilities and making preparations for possible escalation.

Here are some of the key developments from this evening:

‚Ä¢ Nearly 300 Israelis have been killed and 1,600 wounded while at least 232 Palestinian have been killed and nearly 1,700 wounded. The numbers are likely to rise for both sides.

‚Ä¢ Israeli commander of the Nahal Infantry Brigade, Col.
Yonatan Steinberg, was confirmed as being killed during clashes

.Palestinian resistance fighters took many hostages during the offensive on Israeli settlement‚Äôs bordering Gaza (numbers to be confirmed). 

‚Ä¢ Six Palestinians have been killed across various cities in the occupied West Bank, including a child

‚Ä¢ Israel has called for tens of thousands of reservists to step up for a possible ground invasion into Gaza

‚Ä¢ Gaza is still in total darkness after Israel cut electricity lines, and many have evacuated their homes anticipating an intense attack from Israel

‚Ä¢ Various analysts speaking to Middle East Eye have told us that today's attack on Israel may totally reshape the conflict

‚Ä¢ While it is difficult to ascertain how things will pan out, analysts state that Israel is still in a state of shock from the ""unimaginable blow"" they have suffered.

Details: Militants launched a deadly barrage of rockets and infiltrated Israeli territory, resulting in at least one fatality and multiple injuries. Hamas, the Palestinian group governing Gaza, claimed responsibility for the rocket attack and called for a general uprising against Israel. Moreover, Hamas military commander Muhammad Al-Deif, in a recorded message, urged people to take up arms and dubbed the operation ""Al-Aqsa Storm,"" citing various grievances as reasons for the assault on Israel.

Join me for a joint event with Mariusz Smiejek at @PhotoMuseumIRL on October 14!

Mariusz Smiejek's new book is a unique portrait of contemporary everyday life among loyalist communities in Northern Ireland. We will discuss the overlap between our respective projects with the goal of increasing awareness and knowledge about processes of reconciliation in post-conflict societies that are divided territorially, politically, nationally, and religiously.

instagram,"so what is good girl trauma? in a nutshell, most afab people and women (especially those raised in religious communities) are socialized to take up less space, both physically and emotionally. at some point, you were taught that the needs and comfort of others were more important than your own needs and comfort (and even safety). you were taught that feelings like anger, sadness, disgust, or disappointment were not okay to express. 

this can look like:

-laughing at inappropriate jokes or remarks to ease the tension/make others comfortable. 

-fuming/holding resentment, avoiding healthy conflict/confrontation 

-self sacrificing, neglecting your own basic needs (physical and emotional)

-dissociating during conflict or uncomfortable social situations 

-not standing up for yourself 

-a lack of boundaries in relationships/codependency

-disordered eating

-people pleasing

-feeling uncomfortable when receiving

-feeling guilty when resting/experiencing pleasure

Here‚Äôs to taking up more space and less dancing on the graves of things we should have said‚Ä¶. thanks for all the love on good girl trauma with @janellekroll! check it out on the #newinalternative playlist on @applemusic huge thanks for the add!

instagram,"Life update: On July 14th, I was admitted into the hospital. Weeks leading up, I was extremely fatigued, thirsty, light headed, losing weight, getting headaches, anxious and sleep deprived. I didn‚Äôt piece two and two together with all my symptoms as many of them were related to other aspects of my life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, because I‚Äôm a student-athlete‚Äù, ‚ÄúI lost a lot of muscle because I had ankle surgery‚Äù or ‚Äúmy eyes are blurry because I am sitting at a screen all day‚Äù. When I returned to sport it was very difficult. I couldn‚Äôt go a single day without a 2 hour nap, my body was always cramping up, I would collapse doing a Kip cast handstand on bars and I barely got my double backs around on the tumble track. The day I was rushed into the hospital I had practice and lift and I couldn‚Äôt even pick up a 15 pound weight. I ran to the bathroom and ugly cried and sobbed, looking in the mirror, asking what was wrong with me. I blamed myself for not working hard enough and taking too much time off. After some blood work, I got a call from my sportsmed doctor, she urgently told me to pack my bags and call my parents. She informed me that my blood sugar levels if normal should be between like 80-120 and that mine were well over 1,000. I was in utter shock. The next 24 hours were hectic and I was officially diagnosed with diabetes. I was relieved to know that I wasn‚Äôt crazy for the way I was feeling but also overwhelmed and scared for what my life was going to now look like. I didn‚Äôt think this year could get any worse. I thought I had already hit rock bottom like twice already lol. However, I serve a God who sustains me through it all. He turns all my what ifs to even ifs. Even if I take a pause from my sport, even if standing up for what‚Äôs right leads to conflict, even if my health is taken away, I can still find rest, peace and fulfillment. When God is all you have, He is all you need. I hope to continue to share my story so that you can be encouraged through your own struggles and find what your purpose here is :)

All those who call ""erase Gaza"" do not understand anything about security. Their way is a way that only leads us to more blood and more deaths. Two hundred Palestinians have already died today in Gaza from air force attacks. Thousands have died in the wars of the last decade.  It brought no balance of threat and accomplished nothing. The concept of managing the occupation and the conflict was finnaly shattered today.

There is no way to conduct a policy of military control over millions of people without it leading to more wars and more violence. It is impossible to live a normal and safe life here, when there are millions ruled by us who do not want to be ruled by an army that is foreign to them. The direction to go is the opposite.",,426,"{'like_count': 418, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 48263}",Alon-Lee Green  ◊ê◊ú◊ï◊ü-◊ú◊ô ◊í◊®◊ô◊ü,,2023-10-07 16:33:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/30087689_1736641709715991_806315771213905920_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=5vQSgwrV8wIAX8PvWO5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAGdjbqB5X01hePsaJCefa7rmZIyJL7sb07LweLnGtldA&oe=655A8254,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGrzaPNcwJ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386901460_1353022031972361_6228331562245660572_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=WvMvzSSDgkIAX9Fznm1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBPizLXs_vS5USYUCwImp29orv5HRiiXQYcEzYQYPX_NA&oe=653B4348

instagram,"‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt always show you their true colors when things are going their way, but you start seeing them for who they really are when your interests conflict with theirs, when you ask them to do something for you and they don‚Äôt, even though they promised they would, or when you suddenly start speaking up about what‚Äôs bothering you and they start attacking you instead of understanding where you‚Äôre come from. The truth is, you will never truly know someone or how much you mean to them until you disagree on something or until their loyalty is put to the test.

Because at the end of the day, their actions will always be a reflection of how they truly feel. Their actions will tell you the truth eventually; you don‚Äôt need to listen to their excuses and you don‚Äôt need to justify every little thing they do just to keep them in your life. When someone tells you they love you and they will never let you down, please don‚Äôt believe them unless they have proved that to you, because some people promise you the world only when it‚Äôs two feet away from them, and some people promise to stick with you till the end but then run away when you change the route.

So if someone‚Äôs actions don‚Äôt match their words, please believe their actions. Don‚Äôt make excuses for them. Don‚Äôt come up with stories to make yourself feel better. Don‚Äôt give them too many chances, because they will start taking you for granted and they will start losing respect for you. They will start believing that you‚Äôre okay with anything just because you don‚Äôt want to lose them. If you want your life to be more peaceful and less dramatic, start being okay with losing people who are okay with losing you and start seeing people for who they really are not who you want them to be.‚Äù

instagram,"Writer: Sam Leslie @samleslie_2024 Media: Sofia Gevorgian @sofia_gevorgian The Komenda Wars may be the best example of the unfortunate repercussions of lengthy battles for supremacy and legitimacy. The conflict lasted from 1694-1700 and occurred in the Gold Coast (modern day Ghana), involving the Eguafo Kingdom and nearby African States. It concerned the Dutch West India Company (WIC) and British Royal African Company (RAC) trade rights. The conflict dictated the beginnings of a globalized world which, unfortunately, had drastically negative effects upon the region and its inhabitants. After the Komenda Wars, the Gold Coast became a Slave Coast. A Dutch slave trader, noted in 1705: ‚Äú[the Gold Coast] has already changed into a Slave Coast and‚Ä¶nowadays the natives no longer occupy themselves with the search for gold, but rather make war on each other to furnish slaves.‚Äù
As traffic near the port village of Komenda grew, hostilities surrounding the relationship between states emerged. In the Eguafo Kingdom, there were two main polities: great Komenda, the location of the royal capital, and small Komenda, the coastal village with various European factories otherwise known as a trading house or post. Although trade in gold proved viable before the 1680s, many European charters had yet to settle an outpost or factory for trade and gold mining in small Komenda. This changed when the WIC and RAC each rested their companies' fortunes on the viability of small Komenda while also working with the king of great Komenda. After the RAC abandoned their 7 year old factory in 1680, they returned in the fall of 1681.

Hundreds of #Teamsters gathered this morning in Boston to kick off the #Unity23 Conference. Tom Mari, President of Teamsters Boston Local 25 and Secretary-Treasurer of Joint Council 10, opened today's General Session by welcoming Teamster members and leaders from all over North America to the city of Boston.

Conference attendees heard from General President Sean M. O'Brien and General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman along with Congressman Stephen F. Lynch, International Transport Workers' Federation @itfglobal General Secretary Steve Cotton, and Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey.

""We couldn't have won the contract we did at UPS without unity,"" O'Brien said. ""Moving forward, we have to be united to take on the corporate bullies at UPS, Amazon, Delta, Anheuser-Busch, and others. The fight at UPS is never over. We are just getting started. Enforcing this contract at UPS is going to be key to organizing at Amazon.""

""We are in a historic moment with strikes across the labor movement. The days of avoiding conflict are over. We have to take on these challenges head-on,"" O'Brien added.

""We need to organize in our core industries and negotiate the best contracts for our members,"" Zuckerman said. ""That's what Sean and I have been focused on since we took office. We have good political leaders who have our backs, and we need more of them. If politicians aren't with us and all working Americans, we vote them out. It's not complicated.""

""Twenty million transportation workers around the world know the Teamsters...The world stopped during the pandemic. Transportation workers didn't. We have to strive to improve workers' lives, but that's only possible with strong leadership and support from the rank-and-file,"" Cotton said.

""I am proud to be here standing alongside Sean O‚ÄôBrien, a leader from Massachusetts who now leads the national fight for the Teamsters. Sean never gives up fighting for working families. He's not afraid to be the underdog. We've been working together to take on bad corporate actors,"" Gov. Healey said.

The General Session continues this morning with more speakers. Stay tuned.

instagram,"Today, I want to share with you a message from one of our team members who got drafted to the war this morning. It is a message that reminds us of the importance of empathy, solidarity, and the profound impact of world events on our lives.
This call to duty is a reminder of the sacrifices made by countless individuals in Israel, who stand ready to protect our homeland.

As a Jewish Moroccan woman, I am greatly affected by the significance of these events.
However, it is crucial to emphasize that our response to this situation is not about taking sides in a political conflict. It is about standing up for the fundamental human rights of the Israeli people who are facing unimaginable challenges right now. It is about acknowledging that innocent civilians, including children, families, and the elderly, have been affected by recent events.

Last night during one of our holidays, a cruel enemy attacked innocent civilians, resulting in the loss of lives and countless injuries. At least 700  people have lost their lives, and over 2600 others have been injured and this is probably underreporting. 

Our thoughts, prayers, and hearts go out to all those who have lost family members, as well as to those who are saying goodbye to their loved ones heading into a conflict zone, not knowing if they will return. 

We stand in solidarity of Israel. 
It is essential that we do not remain silent in the face of such suffering.
In these difficult moments, let us come together as a compassionate and understanding community. Let us offer our support, encouragement, and empathy to the people in Israel.",,317,"{'like_count': 252, 'comment_count': 65, 'num_users': 15313}",Clea Harroch O‚Äôhana,,2023-10-07 23:27:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/10932399_333613680177921_243238923_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=5j3db3fFUUkAX9HEZHg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCwSUT0GTGQlAHKPxtuDHBIQuqyFz_H_6eK83wAYt1TIA&oe=655AA592,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHbKhNrtyY/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386833004_784862996742638_7359959426405027352_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qixlvBDjejMAX_mXZy5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCHIoY6FSYmSjxieGeQas7c_UeBxEFdNT-ujRA9ec1ADQ&oe=655AD376

The early-morning surprise attack has left at least 22 people dead and over 250 injured, according to Israel‚Äôs Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency rescue service. It comes on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 War in which Arab states blitzed Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.

Around 2,200 rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip into Israel on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli military, while armed gunmen infiltrated across the border in a ground assault into southern Israel.

Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement that runs Gaza and claimed responsibility for the attack, said it had captured several Israeli soldiers near the border after its fighters entered Israel by land, sea and air using paragliders.

Israel‚Äôs military has not confirmed reports of soldiers having been captured, but one video published by Reuters appeared to show Palestinian gunmen dragging an Israeli soldier out of a tank at the Gaza fence.

MDA also said that one of their ambulances had been taken into the Gaza Strip.

Dubbing the operation ‚ÄúAl-Aqsa Storm,‚Äù Hamas military commander Muhammad Al-Deif said in a recorded message that the group had ‚Äútargeted the enemy positions, airports and military positions with 5,000 rockets‚Äù and that the assault on Israel was a response to attacks on women, the desecration of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and the ongoing siege of Gaza.

In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had launched strikes against a number of Hamas targets in Gaza, and said that it had issued a call-up of thousands of reservists.

Netanyahu has vowed that Hamas will ‚Äúpay a price it has never known‚Äù for the attack. ‚ÄúCitizens of Israel, we are at war ‚Äì not in an operation, not in rounds ‚Äì at war,‚Äù he said in a video message.",,314,"{'like_count': 187, 'comment_count': 127, 'num_users': 114686}",Tezlyn Figaro,,2023-10-07 12:53:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/393485555_314783741175806_7999132620800075675_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=6KSydQ9y5hMAX8y8Hvt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAInQrys5a5b-5KA8O1bnkQu7D38r5RvWoa5S2ZDrE6ig&oe=655B5363,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGSoG5uHt6/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387265952_3584679971789811_1442746311123470872_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ZkQ_BGOSYi8AX_wuhi0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB-65wbauIWQ8XsVa9LMNT42btbG7ZUz5xllEmotpAkwQ&oe=65322264

instagram,"My book, Was It Even Abuse?, is written in four parts to support you in gaining clarity in keys areas of confusion and self-doubt after covert abuse.

Part one explores keys questions we ask ourselves:

*Was my relationship abusive?
*Why didnt i just leave?
*Do they do it on purpose?
*Am I the abusive one?
*Am I overreacting?

Part two explores:

*How the abuser builds tensions
*The impact of acute incidents of abuse
*The role of manipulation
*The effects of trauma bonding

*...And importantly, untangling your responses from being the cause of abuse to facilitate self-compassion and growth. 

Part three explores cognitive dissonance and:

*Our strong attachment to their potential
*Red flags, identifying abusive tendencies and reflections to empower yourself
*How the relationship shifts from the dream to the reality
*Why its hard to let go of the belief in their potential
*Reducing inner conflict, remaining strong in your truth and staying centered in the reality.

Part four explores:

*Thoughts that keep us attached, why we develop them and how to shift towards thoughts that support personal growth.
*Beliefs about love that can be harmful and lead to shame in abusive relationships... and how to shift towards beliefs that enrich us.

The increase in violence comes after months of rising bloodshed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the number of casualties in the West Bank reaching levels not seen in years.

In an unprecedented move, militants have penetrated southern towns using motorcycles, SUVs, and paragliders. Social media videos depict shots being fired at residents in southern Israeli communities.

instagram,"Israel versus Palestine is a ‚Äúconflict‚Äù in which there‚Äôs a severe imbalance of power. We should all dig a little deeper about using the word ‚Äòretaliation‚Äô in this context, considering that Palestinians are actually the ones *retaliating against Israel*. Israel has forced Palestinians to live in an open-air prison, under a brutal apartheid state, and under a constant violent military occupation that is a dangerous fascist police state which controls Palestinians‚Äô daily lives. Palestinians are constantly terrorized, harmed, incarcerated, and killed by Israel‚Äôs government/military. 

Gaza and the West Bank are occupied territories. Israel is a settler-colonial state. Palestinians were just living there, in their own homes and communities, and have been forced out with extreme violence by the powerful, militarized, very well-funded government of Israel. You really can‚Äôt blame Palestinians for being angry and fighting back. You would want to do the same thing if this were happening to you, your family, and your community. 

Also, the origins of Zionism are antisemitic, because antisemites want all of us ethnic Jews to go live in Israel. They don‚Äôt think we belong anywhere else. The government of Israel was originally created by, and has always been funded by, Christians. It has always been fundamentalist, evangelical Christians who fund and support the government of Israel the most. 

It is not ‚Äúantisemitic‚Äù to oppose the government/state of Israel. It‚Äôs not the least bit ‚Äúantisemitic‚Äù to validate the humanity of Palestinians and to advocate for their liberation. #NoToEthnostates #NoToReligiousStates #NoToSettlerColonialStates #FreePalestine",,216,"{'like_count': 208, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 6485}",Sally Hates Capitalism,,2023-10-07 16:44:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/402730347_314082128142324_8708743754769080199_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=HpULqCLDIRMAX8VwaEi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCDhEnkR0UERMY8M2Kut0WXEWRZ9sO65SPWHNoNJCK5hg&oe=655A3C32,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGtHpiOKza/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386640659_997556958131247_1434643358576157483_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=o2U5K_xnq98AX84R0U0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBs3YLuRwONxjWM8UhqwkkvgWN5_ss0wkxsdxgrS58kpQ&oe=655994B3

The Iranian representative also congratulated the Palestinian people and all resistance factions for their involvement in the operation, as reported by Press TV.

He emphasized that the operation underscored once again the Israelis' vulnerability when faced with a substantial initiative and their lack of resilience.

The Iranian diplomat expressed optimism that the resistance would achieve further triumphs on the journey towards the liberation of Palestine.

instagram,"The personal drives the professional!

If you‚Äôre struggling to implement at work, with your health and fitness, this is not usually a work problem or a fitness problem.

It‚Äôs usually a personal problem.

If you can thrive personally, you can show up better at work, in the gym, etc.

You will have the headspace to prioritise what you want in your life.

When there are personal issues eating you up, you go numb.

You‚Äôre not going to think about your calories and macros, training sessions or water intake.

Or even taking on new projects at work or wanting to find the next steps in your business.

You‚Äôre probably going to be pissed off and want to eat junk food.

If you have personal issues going on which a lot of us have.

1. Do your best to solve them even if this means having healthy conflict.

2. If it‚Äôs out of your control, plan how you will attack them or manage them so you can focus on yourself.

instagram,"Gaza and Jerusalem (CNN) ‚Äî Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the country was ‚Äúat war‚Äù on Saturday, after Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a deadly barrage of rockets and sent gunmen into Israeli territory in a major escalation of the long running conflict between the two sides.

The Israeli military said about 2,200 rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip into Israel, while armed terror groups infiltrated into Israel by land, sea and air ‚Äì in paragliders. Multiple explosions were heard over Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and in southern Israel ‚Äì some blasts likely the interceptions of incoming rockets ‚Äì while air raids sent Israelis pouring into underground shelters.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Hamas had taken ‚Äúhostages and prisoners of war‚Äù but did not give a figure. At least 200 Israelis had been killed and 1,452 have been wounded, according to Israel‚Äôs emergency rescue service and health ministry.

Israel responded by launching strikes on what it called Hamas targets in Gaza. The Palestine Tower, a high-rise building which hosts residential apartments and media offices in Gaza City, was hit by an explosion and collapsed, video showed.

The Palestinian health ministry said that 232 Palestinians had been killed and 1,697 injured, but did not say where the deaths occurred or whether the toll included Hamas militants or civilians in Gaza.

Netanyahu said operations were under way to ‚Äúclear communities that have been infiltrated by terrorists‚Äù and that he had also issued a call-up of reservists.

‚ÄúWe are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war,‚Äù Netanyahu said in a video statement.

He later vowed retribution against Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement that runs Gaza, in a televised speech: ‚ÄúWhat happened today has never been seen in Israel, we will take mighty vengeance for this black day,‚Äù Netanyahu said.

instagram,"Palestinian militants have begun a ""war"" against Israel, the country's defence minister said Saturday after a barrage of rockets were fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Violence between Israel and the Palestinians has been surging for almost two years, with fatalities in the occupied West Bank hitting a scale not seen in years.

At least two people were killed in Israel, officials said.

Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Palestinian militant group Hamas has ""launched a war against the State of Israel.""

""Troops are fighting against the enemy at every location,"" he said in a statement.

AFP journalists said Israel's military began air strikes on Gaza, following the rocket barrage from inside the territory which is sealed off from Israel by a militarised border barrier.

The link above is a new in-depth that looks at the national conflict and puts the case for a socialist solution. As we went to press with it yesterday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel is ‚Äúat war‚Äù after Hamas launched rockets across the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel and Hamas fighters entered Israel. 

This comes after 18 months of growing tensions and outbreaks of violence in both Gaza and the West Bank. According to the UN, up to this Saturday, Israeli forces have killed 212 Palestinians this year, and 30 Israelis have been killed. 

We will be carrying more analysis of the current fighting in the next few days.

While it‚Äôs lovely to imagine a business culture that‚Äôs 100% candid and safe, most of us live in the real world, where things aren‚Äôt so straightforward. Case in point: WSJ published How Candid Can You Really Be With Your Boss? The answer is as usual, ‚Äúit depends.‚Äù It‚Äôs a balancing act and not an easy one to pull off. 

So what‚Äôs the right balance? It‚Äôs up to the culture of the company, which at the end of the day, is leadership's job to design. The job of the CEO isn‚Äôt to do the actual work, but to create an environment where great work can actually be done. 

In our experience, that‚Äôs a candid environment where people can freely communicate without fear of repercussion. Not easy, but important.

instagram,"Dozens of rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel on Saturday, leading to sirens blaring in Israel's south and central areas. The rocket attacks began at 06:30 am, with the Israeli army warning of the threat. A 70-year-old woman is critically injured, and others were harmed as rockets hit central Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convening security chiefs to address the violence. The ongoing conflict stems from Israel's blockade on Gaza since 2007, resulting in periodic flare-ups of violence.

instagram,"During both World War I and World War II, garlic was used for its medicinal properties to treat soldiers. In World War I, garlic was used as an antiseptic to clean wounds and prevent gangrene. It was dubbed ""Russian Penicillin"" during World War II because Russian soldiers, who were given garlic to prevent and treat various infections, had significant success in staying healthy on the battlefield. Garlic's natural antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties made it an excellent choice for keeping soldiers healthy during these times of conflict. 

This historical use of garlic is one of the reasons it's still considered a superfood today, valued for its immune-boosting and health-promoting properties.

üìº U.K. PREMIERE üö®
VIDEO INTRODUCTION BY DIRECTOR @lu__de__ba 

Produced by @pauline.chalamet + @rachelxwalden 
üé• Sean Price Williams + Hunter Zimny

Seven stories. One city. A disparate group of characters fill out this darkly comedic anthology of New Yorkers at their wits end. When the dailiness of urban life is suspended by an unforeseen conflict, each character must make a decision. While the outcomes vary, a unified sense of the city emerges: New York becomes a mirror to the ego reflecting our true character, while the rest sinks to the bottom.

instagram,"The conflict between Israel and Hamas continues to escalate, with 198 Palestinians killed and 1,610 wounded in Gaza, while 40 Israelis have been reported dead, and at least 779 injured. The conflict erupted after Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israel, which also included infiltrations into southern Israel. Palestinian fighters engaged in clashes with Israelis, and Israel declared a ""state of war alert."" The situation follows weeks of growing tensions, and Hamas has called on resistance fighters in the West Bank and Arab nations to join the battle, while Israel has mobilized army reservists in response to the crisis.

instagram,"The ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel resurfaces as Mars squares off to Pluto as Pluto stations direct.

As written in previous posts unresolved issues and conflicts arise with these signatures.

In 1948, the Israeli Declaration sparked the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. It was 5 days after an eclipse at 18¬∞ Taurus. For the chart of this time back in 1948, we see transiting Pluto at the IC, and transiting Venus conjunct natal Mars at 28¬∞ Leo. Venus is now returning to where retrograde started a few months ago, again in the 150¬∞ aspect, quincunx to Pluto.

We can also see that the coming solar eclipse will be on the ASCendant of this chart at 21¬∞ Libra, as the nodal axis straddles the horizon line. The coming Lunar eclipse 5¬∞ Taurus will square the natal Moon at 4¬∞ Leo. Uranus is conjunct the Sun and Jupiter the natal North Node all in earth sign Taurus.

May there be peace in this ongoing turmoil.

.....................................................

#REPOST @attwoodgarnett with @get__repost__app  From Passive to Assertive: Empowering Autistic Women

Many autistic individuals often find themselves facing unique challenges in their interpersonal relationships. This can lead to feelings of victimisation and, in some cases, even exploitation. In a recent study by Sarah Bargiela and colleagues (2016), participants shared their experiences, shedding light on the journey from passivity to assertiveness and the obstacles they encountered along the way.

** Please note that this post includes references to sexual abuse, which may be distressing to some readers; if you find such content distressing, please consider refraining from reading further. **

Passivity and Its Consequences:

Participants frequently linked their perceived passivity to their autism, highlighting how it had led to unhealthy relationships and high-risk situations. One participant expressed the pressure she felt to conform, stating, ""I almost feel pressured by society to do it because you get told this is what is expected of you to make you be a good girlfriend, and you think, if I don't do it, then I am not fulfilling my duties."" This struggle to please and appease others often left them feeling trapped.
Avoiding conflict was another common theme among participants. For many, any form of verbal disagreement was seen as 'having a fight.' This avoidance sometimes resulted in over-assertiveness, leading to damage in their friendships. As one participant put it, ""When it finally comes out, I can be a bit too blunt."" However, there were exceptions, with some women refusing to appease when they knew something was wrong.

A Shocking Incidence of Sexual Abuse:
Disturbingly, nine out of fourteen participants reported instances of sexual abuse. Half of these accounts occurred within relationships, where young women felt obliged or ""gradually being pestered"" into sexual activities. Arguments often escalated into sexual encounters, even when they didn't want to engage.

These two artillery pieces were presented as Trophies to the School by the Government of India in 1928 in recognition of the School's contribution to the Great World War of 1915-1918, and to honour the twenty-seven Sanawarians who fell in action during the conflict. These are early Turkish, 3.5"", (13-pounder) breech-loading field guns reported to have been captured in 1916 in the Dardanelle during the Gallipoli Campaign. The guns with their carriages, were despatched from Ferozepore Arsenal on the 20th of March 1928, and after de-commissioning were installed in their present sites on the quadrangle in time for the opening ceremony of Birdwood School and unveiling of the Cenotaph in September 1929.

The guns remain standing there to this day, still overlooking the Cenotaph and Memorials below - silent sentinels to the memory of Sanawar's fallen.

instagram,"Snow Leopard Conservancy, and our partners International Veterinary Outreach, Mountain Spirit, and Animal Nepal, recently hosted an eight day training program for Nepalese Junior Technicians and Junior Technical Assistants working in Manang District as part of the ""One Health - One Wellbeing Animal Health & Conservation Training Workshop & Animal Health Clinics"". 

The workshops were designed to strengthen local institutions to advance domestic animal health & welfare while mitigating human-wildlife conflict in the remote mountain communities of Nepal. 

Combining classroom based interactive learning with hands-on training, the workshop aimed to empower veterinary technicians who play a crucial role in promoting animal health & welfare as well as mitigating human-wildlife conflict in their communities to support coexistence with carnivores. 

During this training, we were able to provide preventative veterinary care for 250 domestic animals, reducing the threat of emerging zoonotic diseases spread to wildlife, particularly endangered snow leopards in Nepal. 

Very special thanks to our local and international partners @ivo.vets, @animal_nepal, Mountain Spirit and the rural municipalities within the Manang district of the Annapurna Conservation Area for making this possible! üêæ

I am deeply disturbed over the escalation of violence in Palestine and Israel. There should be maximum restraint to prevent further bloodshed and loss of human lives. The situation calls for an immediate ceasefire as the hostility and confrontation between Palestine and Israel will further increase the sufferings of the people. I urge the international community to play its active role to prevent both sides from further escalating the conflict and work for a long overdue peaceful resolution of the dispute in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions and international law.",,79,"{'like_count': 77, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 35078}",The President of Pakistan,,2023-10-07 21:48:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/79489990_2391314604419034_8332042181200052224_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=iPQc0q9KWloAX--MYzX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCa_tcmvlrsbPLgCS-9lVrgsuFv519j2c3JhwZugOWPrg&oe=655ABB7B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHP1EUty2h/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/387196592_807376874513362_3339779515430495457_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ruBJsSVuP_kAX8Vnl2n&_nc_oc=AQlXu_CISDe-6yqxK4hyqnN2Zlq2dLQqN4mW-g0fDHuLOmKwtXcrEFBZtdnZ-9YM3oY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAIpf9sSn_Opm1dme8IQaupDOMJO2KfsjKBQgLcX68b1g&oe=6534CE3E

instagram,"In a culmination of escalating tensions that have plagued the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for months, rockets descended upon Israel from Gaza today. 

This onslaught resulted in the highest number of casualties witnessed in the West Bank in years. Hamas, the Palestinian faction, has asserted responsibility for this rocket attack, asserting that their militants initiated an extensive barrage exceeding 5,000 rockets. 

In a statement issued by the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of Hamas, they declared, ""We decided to put an end to all the crimes of the occupation (Israel), their time for rampaging without being held accountable is over,"" Under the banner of ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,"" Hamas launched an initial salvo of over 5,000 rockets within the span of 20 minutes.

Through this campaign, it is our goal to educate family court professionals on the reality of post separation abuse. If you are a family court professional, we ask that you:

Imagine yourself in the shoes of a survivor.

Imagine believing you did the right thing in leaving an abusive relationship.

Imagine discovering a new, often more painful form of abuse: post separation abuse.

Imagine your child being used as a pawn for the sole purpose of hurting you.

Imagine being unable to protect your child and if you try, you are reprimanded and punished. Imagine being labeled as ‚Äúhigh conflict‚Äù when you are simply desperate to protect your child. 
Imagine the system that you thought would protect you, failing you.
 
Imagine getting messages like this every day, the attacks are pervasive and unrelenting, affecting every part of your life: your job, your mental health, your cognitive functioning, your emotional state, and your ability to parent.
 
We don‚Äôt have to imagine; this is our life.

instagram,"üìªüì° The Conservation Hour radio shows are a regular feature on Mnkhanya Community Radio station (88.3 FM). Every Wednesday, between 5pm and 6pm, CSL, @zcp_zambia and @chipembelewildlife take turns to discuss topics that inform and engage the local community about conservation issues. Once a month, we all combine for a joint recap show. More than 50,000 listeners tune in each week, and have the opportunity to phone in and ask questions.
¬†
So far this year, CSL has presented shows about how farmers and chilli patrollers can work together, the annual Fun Run, farmer exchange visits, and recently, CSL‚Äôs quarterly human-wildlife coexistence meetings and the importance of stakeholder collaboration. Wide-scale messaging via radio is a valuable tool in helping communities understand how to safely prevent and reduce wildlife conflict.
¬†
Thank you @wwfzambia for funding the conservation radio shows.

instagram,"Ignorance, antisemitism in curriculum and lack of education about the Holocaust, the Nishul, the Middle East is why it‚Äôs happening again and why American academia supports it.

Repost from @cameraoncampus
‚Ä¢
It should come as no surprise that with Hamas‚Äô invasion of Israel, ‚Äúpro-Palestinian‚Äù student groups are promoting content supporting this unprovoked act of mass murder. Chapters from SJP and other similar college organizations around the country continue to share material that labels this brutal surge of attacks as resistance against an occupying power ‚Äî a blatant lie. 

By aligning themselves with a terror group, they further harm Jewish communities on and off campuses all over the world ‚Äî whether they know it or vainly think that their actions constitute justice.

We call on our friends, colleagues, allies, and students to stay alert regarding these anti-Israel groups. Screenshot the hateful misinformation and lies they spread. Their parroting of terrorist talking points has nothing to do with the liberation of the Palestinian people.

If you believe, as members of these groups do, that a door-to-door search for Israeli and foreign civilians to kill is justified based on Israel‚Äôs alleged past actions towards Gazans, you betray your ignorance about the conflict and should step out of the fray before you confuse more people with your drivel.

We call for universities all over the world to investigate these chapters for promoting violence in violation of university policies.

instagram,"From our General Dr. Tanoe @tubiepharmmama:

Hi Phriends! I know it is super early but I have a 12 hours shift today and so no updates from me while at work to avoid any conflict.

Per disclaimer again, I 100% support Walgreens  employees to do this. 100% ! However, I am legally bound to say that I can‚Äôt ask anyone to walk out! Personal choice!

That being said, here is your process from the organizers. If you are a Walgreens employee and you want to participate, you can either ‚Äú call in sick‚Äù or you can literally walk out! That‚Äôs up to you! Simply, make sure that you are comfortable with your choice. While there is indeed unity in standing together and many employees have already chosen to participate, the organizers still want you to feel comfortable with your choice! 

Secondly, for the rest of us who want to support, we will do the same as KS. 

1) Keep sharing! Use #OperationSpotlight
2)wear colors : purple, black, blue and yellow for solidarity and support. Feel free to post on social media 
3)if you are brave, get in front of a Walgreens and snap a picture with your colors. I am so doing this!!! 
4) contact news station/ media outlet to get light on working conditions with emphasis again on patient safety ( always)!

If you are an association, I will suggest that you start working on your statement. Again, my advice to you is to please please stay away from repeating the same thing about PBMs and provider status! Simply show your support to those Walgreens employees by keeping your message about safety and culture! If you need examples, many state like VA, NY and CA  and KS took those stands! 

Thank you guys so much! I will keep everyone updated as I get information.

What a beautiful time to be alive and a pharmacist!

instagram,"This Meditation is Free and is available on YouTube!

Seven chakra meditation is believed to have a positive impact on various aspects of our lives, including mindset, health, wealth, and relationships. Here's how it can help:

1. Mindset: Chakra meditation encourages self-awareness and mindfulness. It helps you connect with your inner self and understand your thoughts and emotions. This can lead to a more balanced and positive mindset, reducing stress, anxiety, and negativity.

2. Health: Each chakra is associated with specific areas of the body. By aligning and balancing these energy centers through meditation, you may experience improved physical and mental well-being. For example, heart chakra meditation can promote emotional healing and cardiovascular health.

3. Wealth: While chakra meditation may not directly bring material wealth, it can enhance your overall well-being and focus. A clear and balanced mind is more likely to make sound financial decisions, pursue opportunities, and manifest abundance by aligning your intentions with your actions.

4. Relationships: Chakra meditation can help you develop empathy and compassion, leading to healthier relationships. By working on your heart chakra, for instance, you may become more open and loving, improving your connections with others. Additionally, better self-awareness can lead to improved communication and conflict resolution skills.

Incorporating regular chakra meditation into your daily routine can have a holistic impact on your life, contributing to a positive mindset, improved health, a clearer path toward wealth-building, and healthier relationships. However, it's essential to remember that meditation is a complementary practice and should be combined with other positive habits for the best results.

‚ÄúBombs fell inside civilian homes‚Äù in the small town some 50 kilometres (31 miles) south of the city, the local ‚Äòresistance committee‚Äô said.

The volunteer group is one of many across Sudan that used to organise pro-democracy protests. Since the war broke out between the army and paramilitaries on April 15, these groups have helped people caught up in the conflict.

Today the Jewish State is again under attack by terrorists with a murderous ideology. These forces of evil and their underwriters must be stopped.

We condemn today‚Äôs brazen attack on civilians, wanton violence against women and children, and hostage taking of innocent bystanders. Along with all freedom and peace-loving Iranians who seek cooperation and coexistence rather than conflict with our neighbors, we offer our sincere condolences to the victims and their families.

Make no mistake, Israel is being attacked by the same forces of extremism and poisonous ideology that have been taking our once prosperous and progressive region back to the dark ages. 

The Islamic Republic‚Äôs support of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups is undeniable. That regime officials in Tehran celebrated today‚Äôs sad news is further proof that they have no compunction about supporting terror and violence against civilians‚Ä¶.

Father God,

We ask You to intervene in the conflict in Israel. We pray that You will reveal Yourself to Your people as their rock, fortress, and deliverer.

By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Maayan Lubell

REUTERS: The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel in years on Saturday in a surprise assault that combined gunmen crossing into several Israeli towns with a heavy barrage of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip.

As warning sirens wailed across southern and central Israel, including in Jerusalem, Israel‚Äôs military said it was on a war footing and the defence minister said the Iran-backed Hamas had made a ‚Äúgrave mistake‚Äù by declaring war on Israel.

The Israeli military said it had launched air strikes into Gaza, where witnesses reported hearing heavy explosions.

The attack marked an unprecedented infiltration by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and one of the most serious escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in years. At least two Israelis were killed, Israel public broadcaster Kan reported. Medical officials said there were dozens of wounded.

Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. Israel‚Äôs police chief said there ‚Äú21 active scenes‚Äù in southern Israel, indicating the extent of the attack.

In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of conflict ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.

Hamas military commander Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.

‚ÄúThis is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,‚Äù he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.

The last major flare-up between Israel and Hamas was a 10-day war in 2021.",,42,"{'like_count': 42, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 79340}",Kayhan Life,,2023-10-07 14:14:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/353911126_785538409881679_4826530723602058808_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=g-4aSZDI33EAX8TpZlw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBc2tBMrIn5y67MkmwaSPuVQi7Kwbv01kZMeVtZimWlzA&oe=655B7C48,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGb4X-LqeX/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386389649_841386054349781_4812503060377813833_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=d7zV7choYbgAX9l-pDN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA8VyacF5sK1yFpsPcdKNWwMNzHjB1dhgYqjBNu38QRNw&oe=6531820D

instagram,"BREAKING: FG calls for de-escalation of hostilities between Israel, Palestine

The federal government of Nigeria has called for a de-escalation of the latest crisis between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group.

In a statement signed by Yusuf Tuggar, minister of foreign affairs, the federal government called on both sides to exercise restraint and prioritise the safety of civilians.

In the early hours of Saturday, the Hamas militant group infiltrated Israel from the Gaza strip, in what has been described as an unprecedented attack.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli prime minister, has since called the invasion an act of war.

The Israeli death toll from the crisis has surpassed 100, per latest reports, with more than 200 killed in Israeli reprisal attacks in Gaza.

‚ÄúThe federal government of Nigeria is deeply concerned about the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in the early hours of Saturday, 7th October, 2023 and calls for de-escalation and ceasefire,‚Äù the statement reads.

‚ÄúThe cycle of violence and retaliation that the current escalation has assumed, only serves to perpetuate an unending cycle of pain and suffering for the civilian population that bear the brunt of every conflict.

‚ÄúWe are therefore calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue.‚Äù

Published by E.P. Dutton & Co, New York, 1946 First Edition, Second Printing 

‚ÄúKaputt‚Äù offers a distinctive perspective on the war, focusing on the Eastern Front and the collaboration between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Malaparte provides vivid descriptions of the destruction, atrocities, and the moral compromises made by individuals caught in the maelstrom of war. His narrative style combines surrealism, dark humor, and poetic language, adding depth and complexity to the storytelling.

The novel has been praised for its powerful and haunting portrayal of war, challenging conventional narratives and offering a nuanced understanding of the human experience in times of conflict. ‚ÄúKaputt‚Äù remains a significant work of literature that raises important questions about the nature of war, morality, and the resilience of the human spirit.

‚Å£‚Å£
This was the #ItsMostLikelySpicyBookClub September pick and I liked it just fine.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
This book had some really great conflict in it.  Our main character really was strong and I liked how she overcame a lot of mental hurdles to rewrite her life story. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
There were themes of found family, which I am always a sucker for!  It was done really well and was definitely a highlight for me.  Hayes‚Äôs family were some of my favourite characters.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
I enjoyed the romance aspect of the book but did find it a little rushed.  It had some instalove vibes, which is a trope I struggle with.  I think it could have been fixed with just a bit more time spent on the conflict and a more concise forgiveness between the two MC‚Äôs.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
All in all this was a solid start to a series that has piqued my interest and I‚Äôll definitely continue.‚Å£‚Å£

instagram,"Seeing these images from @butserancientfarm and @starhawk_spiral make me weep with the longing for ages past. Of ancestral knowing. Of hope for rebirth. 

It also makes me want to literally leave everything I know behind and take the man, the baby, the books, and the beasts, and create a new, simple life for us from nothing. 

Perhaps this is a trauma response, the sort of grief-induced panic that makes people desire a sudden and extreme life change as a way to escape the relentless emotional black hole of loss.

Perhaps it‚Äôs the feeling that the two tectonic plates of my past and future have reached such a tension point that an apocalyptic break is imminent. 
That feeling of deep misalignment with the life I‚Äôve been living, the conflict of values lived and values held.

In any case, my vehicle of change must be built with hope, love, abundance, and the intuition of Spirit. If the vehicle is made with fear and opportunistic panic, I will make myself blind and sick and miss the beauty of living, which would be a tragedy. 

Next chapter, I see you, I feel you, and I‚Äôm coming for you with all the love and hope my open heart has to give.

Blessed Be and happy Satyrday /|\

instagram,"//Speaking in Code: Decoding Avoidant Responses//Q: ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt he repeat back what he understood when I‚Äôve expressed my feelings honestly?‚Äù
 
Conflict for individuals that have avoidant attachment is very difficult, because it‚Äôs historically been very threatening and unsafe. Conflict did not lead to resolution or deeper intimacy, instead it led to isolation, punishment, manipulation, or some kind of negative outcome.

Because of that, sharing a feeling feels very frightening. It can also feel like when you share your feelings, you‚Äôre accusing them of failure, already. That puts people‚Äôs defenses up.

Here are four possible reasons why it‚Äôs hard for him to respond to you, but there could be others.

1. He simply doesn‚Äôt have the language or emotional vocabulary.

2. He thinks you‚Äôre trying to emotionally manipulate him.

3. What you were expressing induces shame for him, and to articulate it out loud will intensify that experience.

4. What you are saying is very threatening, and so his mind and body lockdown in a dissociative trauma response.

If any of these apply, it will really depend on your partner‚Äôs individual experience.

I hope it helps!

Watching the events unfold in Israel hits very close to home + my heart. 

Having a child, a newborn, you think about their future, not about your own anymore. 

The world they will grow up in, and the world they will live in, when you‚Äôre no longer around to see it. 

You pray deeply for peace, a world that no longer lives in fear, disease, famine and war. 

A world that is not perfect, but is peaceful. 

A world where ego is not so rampant, but spirit prevails. 

A world that is more spiritual than religious. 

A world that is filled with love rather than fear.

A world that is filled with peace, rather than panic + conflict. 

A world that is filled with trust rather than manipulation + betrayal. 

A world that is filled with calm rather than anxiety. 

A world that values energy over money. 

I pray for peace + all of the above, knowing that my prayers are just prayers, but they are also energy, and energy is powerful. ü§çüáÆüá±

5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äôs to Wildfire by Hannah Grace 

After a spicy one-night stand, college students Russ & Aurora go their separate ways. But they‚Äôre surprised to bump into each other on the first day of summer camp where they‚Äôll be working as counselors for the whole summer. And ofcourse, the one rule of summer camp that absolutely cannot be broken? ‚ÄúNO STAFF FRATERNIZING‚Äù üö´.

But with that unforgettable one-night stand still on their minds, how can Russ and Aurora possibly stay away from each other? I gotta give it to them for even trying.

While the blossoming romance was obviously a huge and exciting plot point, I really enjoyed how the story also explored their respective complicated family relationships. Both our main characters have major daddy issues. Russ‚Äôs father is a gambling addict who has consistently put Russ in uncomfortable positions and always made him feel like a failure. Aurora‚Äôs dad is this super rich owner of a formula one racing team who pretends she doesn‚Äôt exist. He only has time for his new girlfriend and step-daughter. This neglect from her Dad has led to Aurora acting out her whole life just to get a smidge of his attention. 

This entire story was so good from the jump that I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. I kept waiting for a cheap miscommunication/conflict scene that would derail the whole book. But every time I thought it was about to happen, it didn‚Äôt lol. Instead we got to see two characters find genuine comfort in each other, learn how to set boundaries, communicate, learn to trust and be open ü•∫.

I‚Äôm so glad I started off October with this one. The banter, the smut, loveable characters, the growth?? üòÆ‚Äçüí® Such a well-rounded story, I‚Äôm obsessed! üíò

instagram,"What I find amazing is that they didn‚Äôt learn from the past, and no quick reaction force to repel the attacks.
Though Israel is no stranger to terrorist attacks, Saturday‚Äôs assault was unprecedented ‚Äì not least because of the lack of warning. Israel‚Äôs military on Saturday found itself caught off-guard, despite decades in which the country became a technology powerhouse that boasts one of the world‚Äôs most impressive armed forces and a premier intelligence agency.

The questions for Israeli authorities are legion. It has been more than 17 years since an Israeli soldier was taken as a prisoner of war in an assault on Israeli territory. And Israel has not seen this kind of infiltration of military bases, towns and kibbutzim since town-by-town fighting in the 1948.

‚ÄúThe entire system failed. It‚Äôs not just one component. It‚Äôs the entire defense architecture that evidently failed to provide the necessary defense for Israeli civilians,‚Äù said Jonathan Conricus, a former international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces.

Whether by coincidence or design, the attacks came the day after the 50-year anniversary of another unforeseen conflict, when a coalition of Arab states launched a surprise attack against Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, in 1973.

Since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, it has spent billions of dollars securing the border from attacks. That has striking at any weapons fired from inside Gaza into Israel and stopping terrorists from trying to cross the border from air or underground using tunnels. To stop rocket attacks, Israel has used the Iron Dome, an effective rocket defense system developed with help from the United States.

Israel also spent hundreds of millions of dollars building a smart border system with sensors and subterranean walls that was, according to Reuters, completed at the end of 2021.

Israeli officials will almost certainly look at where those systems failed on Saturday. As of Saturday morning, Israel said Hamas had fired 2,200 rockets, though it did not release figures on how many of those were intercepted. Officials have not commented on if the border fence did its job.",,18,"{'like_count': 12, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 1665}",Erickson,,2023-10-07 21:55:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/70186073_498071960776102_2878321588099350528_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Kl6AjTnW18sAX_UxO0-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfArlFIXIc7qD5v5GeccIhi9oPYWLLUfuDBNn3-gHOlqEw&oe=655ADCE7,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHQq1YSWoy/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.36329-15/387267980_1565144670686918_418034610009745851_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=2PfzQY4S29gAX_ZiNMv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDiXJ23JKa4alwstWr_EXalhWlG1N5xHiSOEgh21Dpt6w&oe=65320364

instagram,"''In this study, we show for the first time in a female teleost that non-breeding aggression depends on estrogen production. Gymnotus omarorum rely on short term estrogen synthesis to engage in territorial aggression, maintain high levels of aggression, and ultimately reach conflict resolution from which dominant/subordinate status emerges. Our results highlight the importance of fast acting estrogens in the control of non-breeding female aggression in G. omarorum.'' -Lucia Zubizarreta et al., 2020

Treatment with estradiol to animals and birds has been found to increase their aggression while aromatase inhibition has been shown to lower aggressive behavior. In the teleost fish G. oramorum, aromatase inhibition also significantly lowers aggression, as well as resolution of conflicts. In males, inhibition of aromatase leads to a failure to establish dominance after winning a bout. Aromatase levels are very high in teleost's. 

S. nigricans fish aggressively defend their territories year round and have low levels of circulation androgens, even after an aggressive conspecific interaction. Though suppressing androgen receptors does lower aggression in these fish, it could be due to decreased estrogen formation through androgen aromatization. 

Long term aromatase suppression in birds lowers aggression levels. With estradiol treatment their aggression levels return to normal (K.K. Soma, et al., 1999, 2000). 

Siberian hamsters are very aggressive during breeding season. They have low circulating levels of estrogen but their highly sensitized estrogen receptors allow for intense responses to estrogen. 

Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in rodents massively decreases their antisocial aggression, for example, it drastically reduces hostile biting. Contrarily, increased aggression is triggered by hypothalamus and/or amygdala activation. 

ACC activation stimulates the mediodorsal thalamus which is an area involved in behavioral flexibility, and lowers the activity of the basolateral amygdala, as well as the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus. All of these areas are a part of the ''threat circuit'' neural network, involved in initiating aggression.",,16,"{'like_count': 16, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 1034}",Connor Russell,,2023-10-07 21:28:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/401603683_234952729409132_4302157553815471839_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=twoQbdcnU0oAX91IJht&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfByVHFHRCbdaEC-8vxODM5j-8BcV0-g2qs9nzmvFcLnWA&oe=655A2D37,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHNmBMJcQZ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386642157_856290092745666_3194731073842798988_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=XeOWEBt5eqMAX80AkzX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDpwO4HnNYCfiwWx2nUIdp1z6riSeJt9ePR1k5jdCFwcg&oe=6558715B

instagram,"You wake up feeling tired at the start of the day and perpetually feel exhausted. 

On paper you‚Äôre excelling and things ‚Äúappear‚Äù to be going great but feels like you‚Äôre going through the motions.

You sense an internal emptiness that can‚Äôt be satiated by anything externally. 

Day after day you wear a mask pretending everything is fine because you fear being found out for who you really are? 

Lack honesty with yourself

Things feel heavier than usual.

You have a chronic experience of Anxiety, anger, jealousy and holding grudges. 

Saying yes to things with no genuine interest or purpose.

You have difficulty saying no.

Convenience and comfort have become second nature.

You feel disconnected. 

You control more and trust less. 

You‚Äôre out of alignment/ congruency with who you are.

You‚Äôre in constant war and inner conflict. 

You resist your past and allow it to haunt you. 

Unaware of your purpose or reason for being. 

You‚Äôre cynicism is out weighing your optimism.

You‚Äôre tired of where you are and your afraid to begin again.

You‚Äôre afraid to take risks.

You‚Äôre unfulfilled.

If this is you‚Ä¶

Your soul may be tired. 

And when your soul is tired, It doesn‚Äôt need sleep or rest. 

It wants ADVENTURE.
It wants EXPANSION.
It wants GROWTH.
It wants FULFILLMENT.
It wants PURPOSE.
It wants CHANGE. 

It wants YOU.
It IS YOU.",,15,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 42048}",SAMSON ODUSANYA,,2023-10-07 22:16:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/241400386_4540954892628900_4455439058714903718_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=PoOVy7Rq5AAAX8XFba3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCuf-IX0EX5XGUpQdpasAXC1OgU295todMWlSqalc1LNw&oe=655A018A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHTGaHuO2u/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386869010_344499688055599_3493804130155802958_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=t_0lEChwcvMAX-PZqj7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAeOB7r9hT2LWhEn8hr4u41OTNPpPerDK38c2a8p0AIMA&oe=655A34CF

instagram,"In our lives, we may come across various types of toxic people who can have a negative impact on our mental and emotional well-being. Here are 5 types of toxic people to be aware of:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The Drama Magnet: This individual seems to thrive on chaos and conflict. They may exaggerate or create drama to draw attention to themselves, often making mountains out of molehills and leaving you feeling emotionally drained.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The Controller: This person seeks to control and dominate others. They may be overly critical, manipulative, or possessive, often attempting to dictate how you should think, feel, or behave.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The Narcissist: This person has an inflated sense of self-importance and a constant need for attention and admiration. They lack empathy for others and can become manipulative or emotionally abusive to maintain their sense of superiority. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ The Energy Vampire: This individual has a knack for draining your emotional energy. They may be excessively negative, needy, or demanding, leaving you feeling exhausted after spending time with them.

5Ô∏è‚É£ The Compulsive Liar: This person has a habit of lying, even when there's no apparent reason for it. They can distort the truth to manipulate others, making it difficult to trust them and causing instability in your relationships.

instagram,"Arabs and Jews are cousin, Arabs just have more African admixture while Jewish Jews just have most consistent East Asian admixture.

The Israeli Palestinian conflict is one of the world's most enduring conflicts, beginning in the mid-20th century. The Israeli Palestinian and Arab Israeli conflict are eternal because Western Eurasians are very competitive in both religious, politic and economy. 

There are many optimistic folks with ideological purist mindset think that peace could be established through education and benevolent beliefs and ideology. Those nice individuals tend to ignore the reality of genetic biological aspect because majority of folks are tribalistic in nature influenced by emotional and sentimental bias which affects judgement.

Every time political conflict and tension happened, then it is a good opportunity for both sides to learn about genetics to understand the core nature of human beings is limited in the laws of biology which is already designed by God and Hashem made mortal beings in limited environment governed by biological system.

Politics in Middle Eastern is always hot. Looking at genetic admixture analysis breakdown among powerful ethnic groups who involved in Middle East politic is interesting.

Chapter Eight
This was no ordinary statue. It was nearly three metres high. It depicted Joseph in his prime, with flame-red hair, a pale yellow skin tone (to indicate his northern origins) ‚Ä¶ but also clearly marking him out as an Asiatic (and not Egyptian) servant of Pharaoh. The body of the statue was painted as if wrapped in the full-length robe of the vizier. But it was a vizier's cloak of a very different kind - decorated in an elaborate pattern of reds, blues, blacks and whites to represent the woven coat-of-many-colours' of a Middle Bronze Age Asiatic chieftain.

Painting Title : Echoes of Extinction: A Polar Bear's Last Breath.

Interpretation:Polar bears are a species that live
in the Arctic, where they rely on ice covered waters to access seals, their primary source
of food. They also use sea ice to rest and breed. The polar bear is considered the largest
bear species on Earth. Unfortunately, they face numerous threats to their survival.
Climate change is the most significant threat, as melting sea ice reduces the polar bear's
access to food and habitat. Human polar bear conflicts have also increased as polar bears
search for food during the summer months. However, people are learning to adapt to the
polar bear's presence and take preventative measures to reduce the risk of conflict.
Additionally, the oil and gas industry's interest in the Arctic poses a significant threat to
polar bears' habitat, as oil exploration can lead to habitat destruction and oil spills that can
harm and even kill polar bears. Oil spills can also reduce the insulating effect of the bear's
fur and poison them if ingested. Unfortunately, the effects of climate change and human
activity have already had a devastating impact on polar bear populations. A recent study
found that the population of polar bears in northeast Alaska and the Northwest Territories
declined by 40 percent between 2001 and 2010 , from 1,500 to 900 bears.",,9,"{'like_count': 8, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 26910}",Mahfuzur Rahman,,2023-10-07 16:34:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/249658154_676768567044156_847588755204399408_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Jgwnoa1zW10AX9Kch5N&_nc_oc=AQn_uOX1e-r-_mUtWBSus677Wy246o5JflmqXzl2nISkHC7lW7RmmwQ0gnfcNY-FNZ8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCSTUf-QWd9fHDddDppWoVPpVdrv1GNPmAPIP0LnDM-qw&oe=655B4A29,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGr7FwJXqZ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386567488_2281792788682661_2853260969406780147_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JEM1mRf6floAX-CL68_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBad5ZJuMVIuUvdP00o2YrQDQ_sTOl6UmS8fE-VbAmKtw&oe=653156D2

instagram,"Book review 
The Spanish Diplomats Secret by Nev March
Thank you to @netgalley and the publisher for an audio arc in exchange for my honest review. 
This was the first book I've read in the Captain Jim series. I think you can pick up the story from anywhere as this mystery was completely done on the ship itself. The only thing I missed out on was the relationship between Jim and his new wife Diana so I didn't know a lot about them or how they came to be together. I did like what we saw of their relationship, Diana did spend most of the voyage feeling seasick and just unwell in general so we mainly only saw Jim doing his detective work on his own until the last half of the book. Because of that Jim spent most of his time talking to several other people on the ship as he tried to find out what happened. Overall I did enjoy this story and found it interesting. I struggled to solve this mystery before Jim did which was nice for a change. We did get little hints and clues that were helpful, I just wasn't catching on to them because I was focused on a different character who I felt was acting suspicious. Some of my favorite parts of this story were ones where real history was woven into the story as it was talked about that America had a conflict with Spain about Cuba, and some other European power things were going on as well that were interesting to see be included in the story and how the passengers talked about it all. The narrator of this audiobook I enjoyed. The only part I did not like at times was some of the voices that were used for several of the women's side characters (one in particular reminded me of a TikTok voice changer sound and it got old rather quickly.) It was easy to tell who was talking in the story which was good since there were so many side characters who were important to the story. I do see myself potentially continuing with this series to break up some of the other series I am currently reading.",,4,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 1400}",Erin,,2023-10-07 17:04:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/376216320_690078872981402_4472951586626717228_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=IgdbxH2wVmoAX_taFLX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBUArbzH0754xIzqi2NZwkTP5VwUHtQhi4q8IpNkxH9kQ&oe=6559DE99,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGvVt8rnyd/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386897168_911954503624712_1411063491083352988_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=h3O4GqEV9asAX_Obg8X&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDYGPQvquxvARftUuvea9cb2h0bPtz5CnUjj58smxqkIg&oe=6559791E
instagram,"A treat to #spooktober with this collection of 7 stories and a title novella. I was intrigued for theme that was based on supernatural elements with our local multi-culture beliefs and myths; bit ghostly and slightly gore to me but loving most of the plot arcs and how each enthralled me with its tale on one‚Äôs desire, immorality, of loss and fears, vengeance, mystical atonement and dark secrets that lurking almost wickedly unsettling throughout the executions. 

I enjoyed the title novella, The Muse the most as it had a gripping dark adventure of an elderly editor who was trying to save his author from a series of a vengeful spirit‚Äî the backstory was intense with its sense of eeriness that hooked me till the end. A menacing plot for Feed The Boy with a toyol and its nightly hauls‚Äî of greed, regret and a black magic mess. Duke of Zhi amused me much with its fun storytelling, love the interactions and those unreal afterlife tour with the chinese myth demon. Spooky plot for Lullaby with a man who was tormented by his unborn child‚Äî disturbing suicidal scene yet I like the psychological part of it. Surreal and inventive execution for Sword of Angel‚Äî a dead dude gets reincarnated as a super assassin; so classy with an appealing chaos of its crime thriller scenes.

Loving the rest as much for the characterization also how few highlighted a riveting issue of paedophilia, psychological stress, familial conflict and one‚Äôs lifestyle in general. A recommendation for a short stories collection if you‚Äôre into supernatural theme and wanna go local. 4 stars to this!

instagram,"Be encouraged! God loves you! 
Do you really believe this truth in the deepest part of your heart? 
When you accept and live with this truth of how much God loves you and created you for a purpose, you will find it so much easier to obey His Word and protect your relationship with Him. 

Warning: 
Fight the devil‚Äôs lie that you are unworthy of God‚Äôs love. 
The devil is a liar. 
Tell yourself the truth. 
‚ÄúI am a child of God. I am loved.‚Äù

Watch: 
Did you hear? Israel is in the news today. More trouble. More wars. More disobedience. More conflict. 
BUT GOD! 

God chose Israel in the Bible but not because of their size or location. God‚Äôs choice of Israel was simply due to His love. 
God is Faithful. 

Deuteronomy 7:7-8
‚ÄúThe LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.
But it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.‚Äù

Even in Israel‚Äôs rebellion and stubbornness they received and still receive undeserved mercy, and grace from God. And so do we. 

The fact is God loved them because He chose to love them. And He loves you because He chooses to love you. 

Wisdom: 
God keeps His Covenants. 
This is a key truth!
Because of God's unconditional covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all generations, you are loved. 

Take this truth to heart:
You are loved with an everlasting love by a Divine Faithful God who created you and has a divine plan for your life. 

Deuteronomy 7:9
‚ÄúKnow therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments.‚Äù

instagram,"Palestinian militants have begun a ""war"" against Israel, the country's defence minister said Saturday after a barrage of rockets were fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Violence between Israel and the Palestinians has been surging for almost two years, with fatalities in the occupied West Bank hitting a scale not seen in years.

At least two people were killed in Israel, officials said.

Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Palestinian militant group Hamas has ""launched a war against the State of Israel.""

""Troops are fighting against the enemy at every location,"" he said in a statement.

AFP journalists said Israel's military began air strikes on Gaza, following the rocket barrage from inside the territory which is sealed off from Israel by a militarised border barrier.

""Dozens of IDF fighter jets are currently striking a number of targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip,"" the military said.

Rockets had earlier streamed across the sky repeatedly after the first launches from multiple locations across the Palestinian territory from 6:30 am (0330 GMT), AFP journalists in Gaza City reported.

The armed wing of Hamas, which controls Gaza, said it was behind the aerial assault, saying its militants had launched thousands of rockets and its fighters seized an Israeli tank.

Israel's army did not immediately comment on the tank claim when contacted by AFP.

Israeli security chiefs convened over the violence, which occurred on Shabbat and during a Jewish holiday.

Air raid sirens wailed across southern and central Israel, and the army urged people to stay near bomb shelters...

instagram,"If you don't know why Israel and Palestine are fighting, heres

The Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict is one of the world's longest-running conflicts, with roots dating back to the late 19th century. The core of the conflict is the competing claims of Israelis and Palestinians to the same piece of land, the Holy Land.

Background

In 1947, the United Nations proposed a partition plan to divide the British Mandate of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The Jewish community accepted the plan, but the Arab community rejected it. In 1948, the State of Israel was declared, and the surrounding Arab countries launched a war to try to prevent its creation.

The war ended in 1949, with Israel in control of most of the territory of the former Mandate of Palestine. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced during the war, and many fled to neighboring countries.

The current situation

Today, Israel controls the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. The West Bank and Gaza Strip are considered to be Palestinian territories under international law, but Israel has maintained a military occupation of these territories for over 50 years.

The Palestinian people have limited self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but they are not sovereign. The Israeli government has built settlements in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law. These settlements have fragmented the West Bank and made it more difficult for the Palestinians to establish a viable state.

There have been numerous attempts to resolve the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, but none have been successful. The most recent peace talks broke down in 2014.

The international community has generally supported the two-state solution, which would involve the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. However, there are significant disagreements about how to achieve the two-state solution, such as the borders of the two states, the status of Jerusalem, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees.

instagram,"My heart aches today for the loss of so many innocent lives.

This tragedy is a stark reminder of the ongoing injustices faced by the Palestinian people in Gaza. The historical context of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, rooted in decades of tension and displacement, plays a significant role in this injustice.

The conflict traces its origins back to the early 20th century, with tensions between Jewish immigrants and the Arab population in the region. The establishment of Israel in 1948 resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, leading to the Nakba or ‚Äúcatastrophe.‚Äù

Gaza, a small strip of land along the Mediterranean, has been a focal point of this conflict. Despite Israel‚Äôs withdrawal of settlements and military forces in 2005, it retained control over its borders, airspace, and sea access. This has contributed to a cycle of violence and humanitarian crises.

The recent loss of lives underscores the urgency of addressing this longstanding issue. We must stand together, regardless of our backgrounds, to condemn violence and work towards a peaceful resolution. Let us pray for the victims and their families and strive for a world where all can live in peace and security.

Subject: Should we change the brand name to Halos?

‚ÄúI found this advertisement that never went to print. It was one of my favorite concepts because the gentle glow around the packaging reminds me of how heavenly our Mini Donuts taste. From the minute the glaze starts to melt in your mouth until the very last dense, cakey bite, I always feel like I‚Äôm truly in heaven. It got me thinking‚Ä¶ is ‚ÄúDrumroll‚Äù the best name? If we rebranded to ‚ÄúHalos‚Äù we could subtly remind customers of the other-worldly experience they‚Äôll get with every purchase.

Since we spent all of 2022 rebranding to Drumroll, I felt bad bringing it up at our weekly ‚ÄúShare Any Idea Meeting‚Äù. Just something to consider.‚Äù

instagram,"As per CNN, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the nation was in a state of war on Saturday. This declaration followed a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. Palestinian militants launched a substantial barrage of rockets and infiltrated Israeli territory with armed gunmen through various means, including paragliders.

The Israeli military reported that approximately 2,200 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel. Meanwhile, multiple explosions were heard in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and southern Israel, with some of them likely resulting from the interception of incoming rockets. Air raid sirens prompted Israelis to seek shelter in underground bunkers.

The Israeli military stated that Hamas had taken ""hostages and prisoners of war,"" although no specific numbers were provided. We express our concern and offer prayers for everyone affected by this situation. What are your thoughts on this matter?

Israel‚Äôs military has launched air strikes on Gaza in response to a barrage of more than 2,000 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip that killed at least 22 Israelis and wounded hundreds.
‚ÄúDozens of IDF fighter jets are currently striking a number of targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip,‚Äù the Israeli military said.
Hundreds of residents fled their homes in eastern Gaza to move away from the border with Israel.
Men, women and children were seen carrying blankets and food as they fled, mostly in the northeastern part of the territory.
The latest escalation comes against a backdrop of surging violence between Israel and Palestinian fighters in the West Bank, which is part of territory illegally occupied by Israel, and the blockaded Gaza Strip.
It also comes at a time of political upheaval in Israel, which has been riven by deep divisions over moves to overhaul the judiciary, and as Washington works to strike a deal that would normalise ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia.",,1,"{'like_count': 1, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 1975}",Peril of Africa,,2023-10-07 12:43:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/385204610_126889287181221_760415599888437902_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=TJKb5h6ZvucAX9wp_mm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD7vogNgUv7YijDkGU0Y4aLWoROXk7QGqJ0lsXo0HXsFQ&oe=655A8439,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGRdv4Mkju/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/386808087_855432595968172_9066119970733251609_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=srSfR146legAX9rvvFv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBvESOQO1wAtgNuWjd0XiIkUW_AtynqN4m82HP96fV7Ng&oe=65316D83

instagram,"By talkdiplomacy Writer: Sam Leslie ATsamleslie_2024 Media: Sofia Gevorgian ATsofia_gevorgian The Komenda Wars may be the best example of the unfortunate repercussions of lengthy battles for supremacy and legitimacy. The conflict lasted from 1694-1700 and occurred in the Gold Coast (modern day Ghana), involving the Eguafo Kingdom and nearby African States. It concerned the Dutch West India Company (WIC) and British Royal African Company (RAC) trade rights. The conflict dictated the beginnings of a globalized world which, unfortunately, had drastically negative effects upon the region and its inhabitants. After the Komenda Wars, the Gold Coast became a Slave Coast. A Dutch slave trader, noted in 1705: ‚Äú[the Gold Coast] has already changed into a Slave Coast and‚Ä¶nowadays the natives no longer occupy themselves with the search for gold, but rather make war on each other to furnish slaves.‚Äù
As traffic near the port village of Komenda grew, hostilities surrounding the relationship between states emerged. In the Eguafo Kingdom, there were two main polities: great Komenda, the location of the royal capital, and small Komenda, the coastal village with various European factories otherwise known as a trading house or post. Although trade in gold proved viable before the 1680s, many European charters had yet to settle an outpost or factory for trade and gold mining in small Komenda. This changed when the WIC and RAC each rested their companies' fortunes on the viability of small Komenda while also working with the king of great Komenda. After the RAC abandoned their 7 year old factory in 1680, they returned in the fall of 1681.

instagram,"Regarding Israel - Hamas conflict, It is my concern that the situation in Israel and Gaza has deteriorated and can directly impact Thai workers in the area.
I kindly ask the Foreign Ministry and any affiliated parties to monitor closely the safety of the Thai workers who are being affected, and formulate a plan for quick evacuation, if necessary. 

As of now, the Foreign Ministry and the Thai Embassy in Israel have been issuing guidelines on how to remain safe, and should continue doing so frequently to keep people updated as the situation evolves.

If any one in our district has family members in the conflict zone, please inform us of names and where they are working, and we will forward that information to the Foreign Ministry and the Thai Embassy in Israel. This is to ensure that the Ministry is fully informed about the Thai people who are potentially in danger in case they don‚Äôt have complete information.
We support the Thai government working with all parties of the conflict to guarantee the safety of Thai workers. We trust that all parties will strictly follow the international humanitarian laws.

At this point, Thailand should not express taking sides as it will hinder the effort in trying to help all of the Thais who are affected.

instagram,"Healthy relationships thrive when they are built on foundations of genuine understanding and open communication, rather than on appeasement or passing judgment. Appeasement often involves suppressing one's true feelings or desires to avoid conflict, which can lead to resentment and an unhealthy power dynamic. Passing judgment, on the other hand, can erode trust and create a hostile environment. In healthy relationships, individuals can express themselves honestly without fear of judgment, fostering mutual respect and emotional intimacy. It's about acceptance, empathy, and growth together. #HealthyRelationships #Communication #Understanding #MutualRespect #EmotionalIntimacy #Openness #Acceptance #Empathy #Trust #GrowthTogether #ConflictResolution #LoveAndSupport #PositiveInteractions #RelationshipGoals #EmotionalWellness #NonJudgmental #Authenticity #HealthyBoundaries #Partnership #BuildingTrust #Connection #HealthyLove",,0,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 108900}",Sarah Khan,,2023-10-07 08:13:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/353943925_231243176341993_1175013696966200187_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=7IpBDSZF8TsAX8K-t0x&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAToCP-AW3KAjAKsCG7gideQelJz8lh0i6kSkJosQ5ShQ&oe=6559BA87,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyFymnMr-Jj/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386756538_707061057977191_8103642507931486276_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=_LAs-_zo1yQAX-IbNqN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDY9b3g7UGmKYz_LiqIqsKneDY11gweJQKayEwM05flMg&oe=6531350D

Irrespective of your position on the Israel-Palestine conflict (and I, for one, am far from believing that Israel is innocent, and I am far from viewing the Netanyahu administration as the embodiment of democratic ideals), justifying the heinous crimes committed by the designated terrorist organization, Hamas (which uses its own people as human shields and places grenade launchers in nurseries full of their own children) and endorsing their grievous war crimes that target not only Jews but also Muslims, and excusing their barbaric acts in the name of a ‚ÄòFree Palestine‚Äô bumper sticker, is nothing short of abhorrent.

Equating Hamas with the entire Muslim community and implicating Islam as a whole in terrorism constitutes an extremely dangerous oversimplification. It‚Äôs paramount to understand that Hamas‚Äôs actions do not represent the genuine teachings and principles of Islam.

The abduction of innocent civilians is an unequivocal war crime!

Bombing ambulances is an undeniable war crime.

The harrowing torment inflicted upon a young German girl, Shani Lauk, followed by the gruesome public display of her lifeless body, is unquestionably a war crime.

This is NOT about Muslims vs. Jews; this is not about the situation in the West Bank; this is not even about Israel versus Palestine.

This is about terrorism against humanity.
This is about Good vs. Evil. This is about Barbarism vs. Civility.

instagram,"üáÆüá±üáÆüá±üáÆüá±I don‚Äôt usually post about stuff like this. But I just want to make this post based off of what I have seen people commenting and posting. A bit of context: last night Palestine launched over 5,000 rockets into Israel, killing many and injuring more. Following this, they began sending in people with guns to attack Israeli civilians and the IDF (Israeli Defense Force)

Above this text is some pictures explaining Palestines use of children in the war and 2 videos, showing the brutality of Palestine. I‚Äôll talk about the pictures here soon, but the videos are of Israeli civilians being taken away into Palestine after obviously being brutality beaten and tortured. The first video shows a girl calling out to her loved one as she is taken away and so is he. There is even videos of Hamas (The Palestinian Group)shooting unarmed Israeli civilians in a bomb shelter after they pleaded and begged for their lives. But I chose not to show this video, as it is truly horrifying and gruesome. All of these videos were created only hours ago, this is very real. 

Also, I actually had taken a class at Flagler College called ‚ÄúCinematic Terrorism‚Äù where we studied Terrorist groups such as Hamas/Palestine. And based off of having an entire semester of that I learned many things. The most notable being Palestine‚Äôs use of child and teen Suicide Bombers. 
Palestine utilizes child suicide bombers a lot. This is a big strategy as children are always considered innocent, and can get close to Israeli soldiers and civilians easily, so they play on this emotion by turning them into unsuspecting bombers. Children are groomed from a young age and are made to believe they will be ‚ÄúMartyrs‚Äù when they turn 16 or 18 and blow themselves up. 

I just want to post this, and show the true side of a conflict that has been going on for ages. ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù is a statement said, but it is a statement that is misunderstood and has a dark meaning. 

Palestines attack today has already brought many war crimes to light, all of which have been videoed.
