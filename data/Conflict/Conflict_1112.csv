On October 7th, a significant escalation occurred between Israel and Palestine. Hamas launched thousands of rockets from Gaza into Israel, leading to casualties on both sides. This attack was unprecedented in its scale, with multi-pronged assaults from land, sea, and air. Videos captured the intensity, showing Hamas infiltrations into Israeli towns and the capture of both soldiers and civilians. Israel retaliated with 'Operation Iron Swords', targeting Hamas assets in Gaza. The international community, including India, the US, the EU, and others, have expressed their concerns and stands on the issue. A major point of discussion is the failure of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, to predict such an attack. While the Palestinian cause has historical roots and deserves attention, the use of terrorism is condemned. It's essential to remember our shared humanity and hope for a peaceful resolution, envisioning a united Israel-Palestine with liberty and equality for all.

facebook,"Hamas‚Äô terrorist assault on Israel will have horrific short- and long-term consequences. As a result of this attack, thousands of Israelis and Palestinians ‚Äì including many women and children ‚Äì have been killed and injured. That toll will rise. The gunning down of young Israelis at a music festival is an image the world will not soon forget. Longer term, this attack is a major setback for any hope of peace and reconciliation in the region ‚Äì and justice for the Palestinian people. For years, people of good will throughout the world, including some brave Israelis, have struggled against the blockade of Gaza, the daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank, and the horrendous living conditions faced by so many Palestinians. For many, it is no secret that Gaza has been an open-air prison, with millions of people struggling to secure basic necessities. Hamas‚Äô terrorism will make it much more difficult to address that tragic reality and will embolden extremists on both sides, continuing the cycle of violence. Right now, the international community must focus on reducing humanitarian suffering and protecting innocent people on both sides of this conflict. The targeting of civilians is a war crime, no matter who does it. Israel‚Äôs blanket denial of food, water, and other necessities to Gaza is a serious violation of international law and will do nothing but harm innocent civilians. The United States has rightly offered solidarity and support to Israel in responding to Hamas‚Äô attack. But we must also insist on restraint from Israeli forces attacking Gaza and work to secure UN humanitarian access. Let us not forget that half of the two million people in Gaza are children. Children and innocent people do not deserve to be punished for the acts of Hamas.",,11397,"{'like_count': 5580, 'comment_count': 1246, 'num_users': 7149588}",U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders,,2023-10-11 15:13:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/233178829_10160224468287908_618879705779792030_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IRlqAjIBHxAAX-AbmN2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBoajYZaV6DxImZXzYHO6A7xiAy47tMydCFC5yzgncnTg&oe=6559C9C3,https://www.facebook.com/100044564583792/posts/892499375578874,

facebook,"POWER COMMUNION SERVICE ‚Äì WEDNESDAY, 11TH OCTOBER 2023 ANCHOR SCRIPTURE(S): GENESIS 32:24-28 MESSAGE TOPIC: DEMANDS FOR DELIVERANCE By: Dr Paul Enenche SERVICE OBJECTIVE(S): Understanding what must be in place for deliverance to happen Complete deliverance is possible with God when the demands are met (John 8:32, 36) ISSUES IN THE FAMILY OF JACOB: 1. 1st borns were not transmitters of the generational Blessing 2. Everyone had to be barren first before giving birth to children 3. They were successful but there was a lot of contention 4. Situations always arose that made them tell lies (Abraham said Sarah was his sister, same with Isaac, then Jacob lied that he was Esau) WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS FOR DELIVERANCE? 1. Impatience with bondage or oppression (Mark 10:46-48) When you come to the point where you are impatient with bondage and oppression then you are at the beginning of liberty 1a. The patience of the oppressed is the strength of the oppressor When the oppressed is patient, the oppressor is strengthened The patience of the oppressed gives the oppressor permission to function 1b. The tolerance of the oppressed sustains the aggression of the oppressor (Mark 10:46-48) There are people who react against you because they don‚Äôt know what it means to be in your position When your destiny/liberty is at stake, never allow any devil to shut you up! Your decision to be desperate compels the attention of Heaven To be a patient you have to be patient In the realm of the spirit, you must be impatient with the devil if you don‚Äôt want the devil to make you a patient 2. Desperation for answer (Gen. 32:24-28; 1 Sam. 1:11; Mark 5:25-29) Place of prayer search for light 2a. Desperation is key to deliverance 2b. Desperation is key to restoration 2c. Desperate efforts are required for drastic results (1 Sam. 1:11; Mark 5:25-29) 3. Dogged faith in the goodness, faithfulness and Almightiness of God (Heb. 11:6; Luke 10:19, 18, 1 John 4:4; 5:4; Mark 16:17) Dogged faith always makes free 3a. Faith that the goodness of God will overcome the wickedness of the devil in your life 3b. Faith that the faithfulness of God will overcome the viciousness of the devil 3c. Faith that the Almightiness of God is bigger than the powerfulness of the devil 3d. Faith that the Blessing is stronger than the curse Wetin dey work for me pass wetin dey work against me! (What is working for me is greater than what is working against me) Never allow the devil to over-magnify himself to you; charge your faith! WHAT CHARGES YOUR FAITH? i. The study of the Word (Rom. 10:17) ii. The testimonies of the supremacy of God over the devil (Rev. 19:10) 4. The maintenance of a fighting spirit (Gen. 32:24-28; 1 Sam, 17:34-50) 4a. There is no freedom without a fight, no victory without conflict 4b. Whatever will be conquered must be confronted 4c. Change happens with the application of force (Gen. 32:24-28; 1 Sam, 17:34-50) To refuse the fight is to agree to fail You fight with the Word, with praise, with our decrees, and declarations. Persistence wears out resistance; when you refuse to be tired, the oppressor must get tired! Father, I receive the baptism of the Spirit of the fighter, in Jesus‚Äô Name! 5. The refusal to give up (Gen. 32:26; Job 14:14; Luke 13:10-12) 5a. Your persistence is the answer to your resistance 5b. If you won‚Äôt give up, you can‚Äôt go down. 5c. If you won‚Äôt give up, you must go up. PRAYERS Father, in the Name of Jesus, I decree the reversal of every satanic contract or handwriting against my life and destiny, the Church, Dunamis, and the Nation, Nigeria. Today, by the Blood of Jesus, I declare, you are reversed! ‚Äì Col. 2:13-15. In the Name of Jesus, today, I cancel every enemy verdict and pronouncement against my life and destiny, the Church, Dunamis, and the Nation, Nigeria. Oh you verdict of hell, you are cancelled by the Blood of Jesus, in Jesus' Name ‚Äì Isa. 54:17. In the Name of Jesus, today, I decree that every altar of satanic activity targeted for adversity, calamity or distraction for my life and destiny, the Church, Dunamis, and the Nation, Nigeria, oh you altar, I command you, CATCH FIRE NOW ‚Äì Jer. 51:25. Father, in the Name of Jesus, I decree that every altar of divination, witchcraft, and enchantment erected against my life and destiny, the Church, Dunamis, and the Nation, Nigeria, oh you altar, and the witches and wizards behind the altar, CATCH FIRE NOW ‚Äì Num. 23:23. Father, I ask that every enemy trap or snares of destruction set for my life, destiny, family, the Church, Dunamis and Nation, Nigeria be destroyed by the Fire üî• of the Spirit in Jesus Name ‚Äì Psalm 124:1-End.

The show focuses on the three million Palestinians who live in the West Bank, an area that is politically distinct from the tiny Gaza Strip, where Hamas rules two million Palestinians. The goal is to step back from the tragic conflicts in the region and share the realities of both the Palestinians and the Israelis, giving caring viewers a balanced context to the events ‚Äî both hopeful and tragic ‚Äî that lie ahead. The Holy Land is important to Americans, and Americans are important to Israel and Palestine. With all the heartbreaking violence, and in the interest of finding durable peace and security in this troubled region, it‚Äôs more important than ever to understand the roots of this conflict.

facebook,"""Pronto una guerra cubrir√° al mundo en cenizas, y es tarea de los despiertos encontrar la chispa para encender de nuevo el fuego sagrado"". Mensaje de Melkisedek, sacerdote de Jerusal√©n, en monte Tabor, Israel. Hace dos semanas. Mientras me cubr√≠a en cenizas, describi√≥ la guerra que se acercaba, y nos dec√≠a una y otra vez que nos vayamos de all√≠, que nuestra misi√≥n era Egipto. Sus palabras fueron claras: cuando vean las cenizas de la guerra, miren dentro y busquen su chispa interior para encender el mundo en luz. Mantengan ese fuego interno ante el conflicto. Lo √∫ltimo que necesitamos es miedo y juicio. Qui√©nes est√°n atacando hoy a Israel no es el pueblo Palestino, quienes conviven con jud√≠os y cristianos y siguen el mensaje de unidad de Allah. Quienes est√°n atacando son terroristas. Ninguna visi√≥n pol√≠tica puede justificar lo que se est√° viviendo. Esto no es una guerra entre dos pueblos, es un grupo terrorista provocando la muerte de propios y ajenos. Que las cenizas que caen sobre esta tierra enciendan la chispa de los corazones. üåéüåç ""Soon a war will cover the world in ashes, and it is the task of the awakened to find the spark to rekindle the sacred fire."" Message from Melchizedek, priest of Jerusalem, on Mount Tabor, Israel. Two weeks ago. As he covered me in ashes, he described the approaching war, telling us over and over again to get out of there, that our mission was Egypt. His words were clear: ""when you see the ashes of war, look within and seek your inner spark to light the world in light. Maintain that internal fire in the face of conflict. The last thing we need is fear and judgment"". Those who are attacking Israel today are not the Palestinian people, who live with Jews and Christians and follow Allah's message of unity. Those who are attacking are terrorists. No political vision can justify what is being experienced. This is not a war between two peoples, it is a terrorist group causing the death of its own and others.

facebook,"On this date in 1970, CANNED HEAT debuted at No. 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 with LET'S WORK TOGETHER (Oct 10, 1970) A blues-based rhythm and blues number that made a plea for fidelity in a fractured marriage, 'Let's Stick Together' was written by Wilbert Harrison and released in 1962, Harrison further developed the song and in 1969 when issued it was issued as a two-part single titled ""Let's Work Together"". Changing the title to ""Let's Work Together,"" Harrison's new message of unity was aimed at a nation rife with conflict over the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. Shortly after the release of Wilbert Harrison's ""Let's Work Together"", L.A. blues-rock band Canned Heat recorded their version of the song. Unlike their previous singles (""On the Road Again"", ""Going Up the Country"", and ""Time Was"") that featured vocals and harmonica by Alan Wilson, for ""Let's Work Together"" Bob Hite provided the vocals, with Wilson adding the slide-guitar parts. The song was prepared for release as a single in December 1969, but was cancelled due to the popularity of Harrison's single. In the UK, where Harrison's single failed to generate interest, Canned Heat's version was released in January 1970. There it became their biggest hit, reaching number two on the UK Singles chart during a stay of fifteen weeks. Several artists subsequently recorded the songs: ""Let's Work Together"" by Canned Heat (1970) and ""Let's Stick Together"" by Bryan Ferry (1976) were both chart successes. Canned Heat didn't mean to overshadow Harrison with their version. In fact, if they'd known the singer was going to have success with it, they never would have recorded it in the first place. They first heard the tune when it was still making the rounds at underground radio stations. Their new guitarist Harvey Mandel played it for the rest of the guys and suggested they cover it, but their co-vocalist, Bob ""The Bear"" Hite, wanted to wait a few months to see if Harrison would chart first. According to drummer Adolfo de la Parra, Hite didn't like taking songs away from living black musicians unless they weren't hits. ""If the song languished among blues collectors, then he thought we could carry it to a bigger audience and at least get the composer writer's royalties,"" de la Parra wrote in his book, Living The Blues.

Israel's army recovered the bodies of more than 1,500 Hamas terrorists within its territory. The war has been the worst in Israel-Palestine's history.

Israel also reported fire exchanges with Syria and Lebanon, and Western countries backed Israel, while Arab nations supported Palestine.

facebook,"Good Wednesday morning everyone and here‚Äôs Gillian: Name: Gillian--- Message: John. I am a big fan of both yours and of Carnival Cruise Line. I am platinum. It only took four years to reach that level. I am feeling very angry today. I will explain. I am on another cruise line now on the ----- ship. This was not my choice. My SIL booked the cruise for us and offered to pay LOL. We were in Civitavecchia yesterday. As we left we went past the Carnival Pride ship and the cruise director was on the public announcement and said ""Italy has a Walmart.‚Äù He was referring to the Carnival Pride as Walmart. I will seek him out today and let him have a piece of my mind. I had to tell you John. What a classless thing for him to have said. Thank you for listening. I will be on the Carnival Horizon over Christmas and I cannot wait! ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Thank you Gillian and please have an epic cruise in the Mediterranean. I cannot wait to see you back home with us soon. So here I am, primed like a coiled slinky to think of something witty to say and to defend the cruise line we all love so much. However, you know what, it doesn‚Äôt matter, it really doesn‚Äôt. If a Cruise Director from another cruise line wants to refer to Carnival as ‚Äú Walmart‚Äù let him. It doesn‚Äôt matter. You see dear reader, while eating my grits early this morning I watched the news. I watched the news and the conflict and the story of how women and children and babies were‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt even type the words. This is absolutely depravity of the worst kind. It's beyond sickening and I find it hard to comprehend this. The depravity, the cruelty, the sickening deeds and it happened in 2023 now! So let the cruise director say that Carnival is the Walmart of cruising. I have heard it all before and I don‚Äôt need to defend it. Our bookings are stronger than any other cruise line and it‚Äôs not easy to find a cruise for 2024 as they are all booking so fast. And in the grand scheme of things with what is happening in the world it really doesn‚Äôt even matter. And as my late father always said, if you are talking about class it probably means you don‚Äôt have any.

facebook,"Little Pardamat is one of the gang! As we often find with orphans who experienced tragedy firsthand, he was heartbreakingly relieved to be rescued: After his mother was killed in human-wildlife conflict, Pardamat spent three long, lonely weeks trying to fend for himself. But such a young calf needs round-the-clock care, protection, and milk if it is to survive longterm.

Ilustre, Pres. Roxas, isang malaking oportunidad ang nakita ng mga residente dito upang makatanggap ng mga serbisyong inaasam mula sa pamahalaan dahil nagtipon-tipon ngayong Miyerkules ang mga national line agencies at provincial offices upang magbigay ng kaukulang serbisyo para sa programang ""End Local Communist Armed Conflict"" o ELCAC. Ayon kay Lola Patria Millamina, residente ng barangay, nagbigay saya sa kanila ang ELCAC lalo na dahil tumanggap ito ng sampung kilo ng bigas, vitamins for senior citizens good for one month, pati na rin punong itatanim sa kanilang bakuran. Isa si Lola Patria sa 635 na pamilya sa barangay ang binigyan ng Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office (PSWDO) ng family food packs na pakikinabangan ng tinatayang 2,100 na kabuoang bilang ng mga residente dito. Kabilang naman sa pinilahan ngayong araw ay ang rabies vaccination at veterinary health ng Office of the Provincial Veterinarian (OPVet) kung saan abot sa 142 na mga aso at pusa ang nabakunahan ng anti-rabies, at 1,265 ang binigyan ng deworming, 2,187 vitamin supplementation, at 2,385 naman ang binigyan ng treatment medicines. Kasama sa naging benepisyaryo nito ay si Liezl I. Quilakil ng Purok B, Brgy. Ilustre kung saan apat na mga aso at dalawang pusa nito ang nabigyan ng kalinga ng OPVet. Ayon kay Quilakil, malaking tulong para sa kanila na mabigyan ng nabanggit na serbisyo ang kanilang mga alaga dahil abot libo rin ang kailangang gastusin kung pupunta pa sila sa bayan at pribadong veterinary clinic. Sa kabuoan, 175 na mga pet / animal owners ang nakabenepisyo sa naturang programa. Samantala, namahagi rin ang Office of the Provincial Agriculturist ng 117 assorted fruit tree seedlings, 200pcs forest trees para sa tree planting program ng barangay, 6 sacks agricultural salt para sa mga coconut farmers, at technical assistance sa 160 farmers. Katuwang din ng probinsya sa pagbibigay ng tulong sa mga magsasaka ang Metro Arakan Valley Complex na namigay rin ng tig-200 hills iron bamboo, durian (puyat), at grafted calamansi; at hindi pa kasali ang 2,000 tilapia fingerlings, 100 seedlings coconut seedlings , at 100 packs vegetable seeds. Iba't ibang serbisyong medikal rin ang natanggap ng mga residente mula sa Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) katuwang ang rural health unit (RHU) ng bayan tulad ng mga sumusunod: medical consultation, 250; dental services, 32; vitamins for senior citizens, 101; buntis kits, 14; complementary food packs para sa malnourished children, 6; mass feeding, 74; oral health kits for daycare children, 50 at assorted medicines na ibinigay sa barangay council. Namigay rin ang DILG ng 50 school supplies, 50 slippers for children ang PNP, at iba pang mga serbisyo mula sa iba't ibang ahensiya ng pamahalaan. Ang Serbisyong Totoo Caravan ay ipinapatupad ng pamahalaang panlalawigan sa ilalim ng pamumuno ni Gov. Emmylou ""Lala"" J. Tali√±o-Mendoza bilang suporta sa whole-of-nation approach na inilunsad ni dating Pangulong Rodrigo R. Duterte at ipinagpatuloy ni Pangulong Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" R. Marcos, Jr. upang wakasan ang insurhensiya sa bansa. Ang nasabing aktibidad ay pinangasiwaan ng PTF-ELCAC katuwang ang Provincial Treasurer's Office na pinamumunuan ni PTO Head Gail V.

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel?  Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately.  Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.  But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.  Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.  And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.  And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.  Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.  But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13)  

The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7)  The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus.  The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets.  It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says.  Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God.  This is no time to follow popular opinions.  This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word.

So what's our assignment as Christians?
Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers.

So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

Ilustre, Pres. Roxas, isang malaking oportunidad ang nakita ng mga residente dito upang makatanggap ng mga serbisyong inaasam mula sa pamahalaan dahil nagtipon-tipon ngayong Miyerkules ang mga national line agencies at provincial offices upang magbigay ng kaukulang serbisyo para sa programang ""End Local Communist Armed Conflict"" o ELCAC. Ayon kay Lola Patria Millamina, residente ng barangay, nagbigay saya sa kanila ang ELCAC lalo na dahil tumanggap ito ng sampung kilo ng bigas, vitamins for senior citizens good for one month, pati na rin punong itatanim sa kanilang bakuran. Isa si Lola Patria sa 635 na pamilya sa barangay ang binigyan ng Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office (PSWDO) ng family food packs na pakikinabangan ng tinatayang 2,100 na kabuoang bilang ng mga residente dito. Kabilang naman sa pinilahan ngayong araw ay ang rabies vaccination at veterinary health ng Office of the Provincial Veterinarian (OPVet) kung saan abot sa 142 na mga aso at pusa ang nabakunahan ng anti-rabies, at 1,265 ang binigyan ng deworming, 2,187 vitamin supplementation, at 2,385 naman ang binigyan ng treatment medicines. Kasama sa naging benepisyaryo nito ay si Liezl I. Quilakil ng Purok B, Brgy. Ilustre kung saan apat na mga aso at dalawang pusa nito ang nabigyan ng kalinga ng OPVet. Ayon kay Quilakil, malaking tulong para sa kanila na mabigyan ng nabanggit na serbisyo ang kanilang mga alaga dahil abot libo rin ang kailangang gastusin kung pupunta pa sila sa bayan at pribadong veterinary clinic. Sa kabuoan, 175 na mga pet / animal owners ang nakabenepisyo sa naturang programa. Samantala, namahagi rin ang Office of the Provincial Agriculturist ng 117 assorted fruit tree seedlings, 200pcs forest trees para sa tree planting program ng barangay, 6 sacks agricultural salt para sa mga coconut farmers, at technical assistance sa 160 farmers. Katuwang din ng probinsya sa pagbibigay ng tulong sa mga magsasaka ang Metro Arakan Valley Complex na namigay rin ng tig-200 hills iron bamboo, durian (puyat), at grafted calamansi; at hindi pa kasali ang 2,000 tilapia fingerlings, 100 seedlings coconut seedlings , at 100 packs vegetable seeds. Iba't ibang serbisyong medikal rin ang natanggap ng mga residente mula sa Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) katuwang ang rural health unit (RHU) ng bayan tulad ng mga sumusunod: medical consultation, 250; dental services, 32; vitamins for senior citizens, 101; buntis kits, 14; complementary food packs para sa malnourished children, 6; mass feeding, 74; oral health kits for daycare children, 50 at assorted medicines na ibinigay sa barangay council. Namigay rin ang DILG ng 50 school supplies, 50 slippers for children ang PNP, at iba pang mga serbisyo mula sa iba't ibang ahensiya ng pamahalaan. Ang Serbisyong Totoo Caravan ay ipinapatupad ng pamahalaang panlalawigan sa ilalim ng pamumuno ni Gov. Emmylou ""Lala"" J. Tali√±o-Mendoza bilang suporta sa whole-of-nation approach na inilunsad ni dating Pangulong Rodrigo R. Duterte at ipinagpatuloy ni Pangulong Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" R. Marcos, Jr. upang wakasan ang insurhensiya sa bansa. Ang nasabing aktibidad ay pinangasiwaan ng PTF-ELCAC katuwang ang Provincial Treasurer's Office na pinamumunuan ni PTO Head Gail V.

facebook,"The Middle East Problem, It's Not Complex ""When I did my graduate studies at the Middle East Institute at Columbia University‚Äôs School of International Affairs, I took many courses on the question of the Middle East conflict. Semester after semester, we studied the Middle East conflict as if it was the most complex conflict in the world -- when in fact, it is probably the easiest conflict in the world to explain. It may be the hardest to solve, but it is the easiest to explain. In a nutshell, it‚Äôs this: One side wants the other side dead. Israel wants to exist as a Jewish state and to live in peace. Israel also recognizes the right of Palestinians to have their own state and to live in peace. The problem, however, is that most Palestinians and many other Muslims and Arabs, do not recognize the right of the Jewish state of Israel to exist. This has been true since 1947, when the United Nations voted to divide the land called Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The Jews accepted the United Nations partition but no Arab or any other Muslim country accepted it. When British rule ended on May 15, 1948, the armies of all the neighboring Arab states -- Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Transjordan, and Egypt -- attacked the one-day old state of Israel in order to destroy it. But, to the world‚Äôs surprise, the little Jewish state survived. Then it happened again. In 1967, the dictator of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser, announced his plan, in his words, ‚Äúto destroy Israel.‚Äù He placed Egyptian troops on Israel‚Äôs border, and armies of surrounding Arab countries were also mobilized to attack. However, Israel preemptively attacked Egypt and Syria. Israel did not attack Jordan, and begged Jordan‚Äôs king not to join the war. But he did. And only because of that did Israel take control of Jordanian land, specifically the ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù of the Jordan River. Shortly after the war, the Arab states went to Khartoum, Sudan and announced their famous three ‚ÄúNo‚Äôs: ‚ÄúNo recognition, no peace, and no negotiations,‚Äù What was Israel supposed to do? Well, one thing Israel did, a little more than a decade later, in 1978, was to give the entire Sinai Peninsula -- an area of land bigger than Israel itself, and with oil -- back to Egypt because Egypt, under new leadership, signed a peace agreement with Israel. So, Israel gave land for the promise of peace with Egypt, and it has always been willing to do the same thing with the Palestinians. All the Palestinians have ever had to do is recognize Israel as a Jewish state and promise to live in peace with it. But when Israel has proposed trading land for peace -- as it did in 2000 when it agreed to give the Palestinians a sovereign state in more than 95% of the West Bank and all of Gaza -- the Palestinian leadership rejected the offer, and instead responded by sending waves of suicide terrorists into Israel. Meanwhile, Palestinian radio, television, and school curricula remain filled with glorification of terrorists, demonization of Jews, and the daily repeated message that Israel should cease to exist. So it‚Äôs not hard to explain the Middle-East dispute. One side wants the other dead. The motto of Hamas, the Palestinian rulers of Gaza, is: ‚ÄúWe love death as much as the Jews love life.‚Äù There are 22 Arab states in the world -- stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean. There is one ‚ÄúJewish State‚Äù in the world. And it is about the size of New Jersey. In fact, tiny El Salvador is larger than Israel. Finally, think about these two questions: If, tomorrow, Israel laid down its arms and announced, ‚ÄúWe will fight no more,‚Äù what would happen? And if the Arab countries around Israel laid down their arms and announced ‚ÄúWe will fight no more,‚Äù what would happen? In the first case there would be an immediate destruction of the state of Israel and the mass murder of its Jewish population. In the second case, there would be peace the next day. As I said at the outset, it is a simple problem to describe: one side wants the other dead -- and if it didn‚Äôt, there would be peace. Please remember this: There has never been a state in the geographic area known as Palestine that was not Jewish. Israel is the third Jewish state to exist in that area. There was never an Arab state, never a Palestinian state, never a Muslim or any other state. That‚Äôs the issue: why can‚Äôt the one Jewish state the size of El Salvador be allowed to exist? That is the Middle-East problem.

facebook,"Ancient Nubia and the Kingdom of Kush The history of northern Sudan stretches back to an astonishing 300,000 years ago. It was home to one of sub-Saharan Africa's most ancient kingdoms, the renowned Kingdom of Kush (approximately 2500‚Äì1500 BC). This culture was responsible for producing some of the finest pottery found in the Nile Valley, including the exquisite Kerma glasses. Sudan was highly sought after for its abundant natural resources, including gold, ebony, and ivory, which captivated the attention of many, including the ancient Egyptians during the Old Kingdom (about 2686‚Äì2181 BCE). This pursuit of wealth often led to conflict as Egyptian and Sudanese rulers vied for control of trade routes. Around 1700 BC, Kush emerged as the dominant state in the Nile valley. This set the stage for a series of conflicts with Egypt, culminating in the conquest of Kush by Thutmose I (1504‚Äì1492 BC). In the western and southern regions, Neolithic cultures persisted, beyond the reach of Egyptian rule. Egypt eventually withdrew in the 11th century BCE, allowing Sudanese kings to rise in power. They not only invaded Egypt but also ruled as pharaohs (around 747‚Äì656 BCE), at the peak of their reign uniting the Nile valley from Khartoum to the Mediterranean. King Taharqo's sphinx stands as a testament to the authority and influence of the Kushites. Although they were eventually expelled from Egypt by the Assyrians, their kingdom continued to flourish in Sudan for another millennium. The monuments and art from this era are a fascinating blend of Pharaonic, Greco-Roman, and indigenous African traditions. This unique fusion can be observed in relics like the relief of the chapel of Queen Shanakdhakete and the aegis of Isis, both housed in the museum's collection. Around 1070 BC, the Egyptians withdrew from Sudan, and in the 9th century, a second powerful Kushite dynasty emerged. Seizing the opportunity presented by political instability and disunity in Egypt, King Kashta extended his control to Thebes in Egypt by the mid-eighth century BC. His successor Piankhi (Piye) went on to achieve complete dominion over the Egyptian Nile Valley around 716 BC, leaving an indelible mark on the pages of history.",,3097,"{'like_count': 2214, 'comment_count': 64, 'num_users': 928302}",Ancient Explorers,,2023-10-11 11:00:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/340082566_1417812029047150_1167558481433753377_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Tt-24VAyTzAAX-SR2SN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCXdNbyXp-x5I4GAy_mcDjs6dHELdywGIoAzsDkuBTGag&oe=6559EB39,https://www.facebook.com/100081774420797/posts/309108298491649,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387824775_309107591825053_1028384270823081330_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=RXCQDiLNKj4AX89M_TA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBqKSUjgU-G0nnULWKa50GGyK42AH7ZBtpysTTwh3ouMA&oe=6559F976

They tirelessly negotiated, made calls, and facilitated all that was needed to bring our people home.‚Äù The Prime Minister stressed a peaceful resolution and de-escalation of the conflict, emphasising Fiji's commitment to pursuing diplomatic, non-violent solutions to conflicts in line with the Pacific's ""Zone of Peace"" initiative. #peoplescoalition #FijiGovernment #FijiNews",,3006,"{'like_count': 1362, 'comment_count': 100, 'num_users': 441526}",Fiji Government,,2023-10-11 21:09:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/322581247_1261063941117967_4081295632486498606_n.jpg?stp=c148.148.1304.1304a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CF4UMfahsPcAX9WxxC-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAagplO64N8u7wlMkKrcJxrvYe9JI_CsV7pPWvp9ZRh1g&oe=655A4BAC,https://www.facebook.com/100064626194509/posts/720655753431958,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387802946_720652656765601_4308195313191664749_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3RxBGz2WY2YAX8H3GvD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMolgQ-LGQClRMpI5qBOcA2aO58axx1fbQf2xNK_fZcQ&oe=652C3729

Ilustre, Pres. Roxas ang pagbisita ni Gov. Emmylou ""Lala"" J. Tali√±o-Mendoza kasama ang mga kinatawan mula sa ahensiya ng nasyunal na pamahalaan, departamento ng kapitolyo, at lokal na pamahalaan ng nasabing bayan upang magbigay ng iba't ibang serbisyo sa mamamayan dito. Sa ilalim ng liderato ni Governor Mendoza isinagawa ang ""Serbisyong Totoo Caravan"", alinsunod sa programa ng nasyunal na pamahalaan na wakasan ang insurhensiya sa buong bansa sa pamamagitan ng ""whole-of-nation approach"", na ipinapatupad sa lalawigan sa tulong ng Provincial Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). Sa mensahe ng gobernadora, inihayag nito na seryoso ang kanyang pamunuan na ipaabot sa mga Cotabate√±o, kahit na sa malalayong lugar, ang serbisyo ng gobyerno at ipadama ang malasakit ng pamahalaan upang makamit ang pangmatagalang kapayapaan at kaunlaran. Sa katunanayan, naglaan si Gov. Mendoza ng 50 milyong piso para sa pagtaguyod ng ELCAC program sa lalawigan. Ibinahagi rin ng ina ng probinsya ang kasalukuyang pagsisikap nito para sa mga kapatid na katutubo o indigenous peoples (IPs) ng lalawigan kung saan ""pilot areas"" ang bayan ng Carmen, Banisilan, at Alamada, na mabibigyan ng hanapbuhay sa pamamagitan ng pagtatanim ng kawayan sa 2,000 ektaryang lupain na pag-aari rin ng mga ito. Tinatayang abot sa sampung libong sahod ang tatanggapin ng bawat indibidwal kada buwan. Hinikayat din nito ang mga residente na makiisa sa pamahalaan at maging mata, tenga, at boses ng mamamayan upang masugpo ang katiwalian at maipaabot ang pangangailangan ng taumbayan. Kasama din ng gonernadora si Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Ali B. Abdullah na nagpahayag ng pagsaludo kay Gov. Mendoza sa suporta nito sa naturang adhikain sa pamamagitan ng paglaan ng kaukulang pondo para sa pagsasagawa ng nasabing caravan Ayon kay PD Ali, naging matagumpay ang implementasyon ng ELCAC sa buong lalawigan dahil sa determinisyon ng butihing gobernadora na dalhin ang mga serbisyo ng gobyerno sa komunidad sa pamamagitan ng ST caravan. Mensahe ng paghanga rin ang ipinaabot ni Ginoong Pedro Arnado, dating miyembro ng makakaliwang grupo at ngayon ay bahagi na ng Speakers Bureau ng Armed Forces of the Philippines. Aniya, nakita na nito ang malasakit ng pamahalaan sa mamamayan lalo na sa mga malalayong lugar at maliliit na sektor sa lipunan. Pinasalamatan nito si Gov. Mendoza na ayon sa kanya dahil sa Serbisyong Totoo caravan naihatid ang napakaraming mga serbisyo at mga proyekto sa mga barangay at mga komunidad. Labis din ang saya ng mga lokal na opisyales na pinangunahan nina Mayor Jonathan Mahimpit at Punong Barangay Helen Gasita dahil sa malaking oportunidad na ibinigay sa kanila ng probinsiya upang maging benepisyaryo ng iba't ibang mga programa at proyekto ang mahigit 2,000 na residente rito. Dumalo rin sa nasabing aktibidad sina TESDA Provincial Director Relly A. Leysa, NCIP Provincial Officer Macapantao Manamba, Provincial IPMR at Ex-Officio Boardmember Arsenio Ampalid, PCL President Rene Rubino, MLGOO Lilibeth Layson, 72nd Infantry Batallion Commander LTC Julius Paclibar, PMAJ Jun Napat ng PNP Pres.

facebook,"A new blog is up on my site! I thought I‚Äôd share some ways to celebrate a most potent day of magic in the witch‚Äôs calendar, Friday the 13th, and dive a little into the 13 expressions/archetypes of the Great Goddess. Friday is Freya‚Äôs Day, the Norse Goddess of love, lust, beauty, fertility, abundance and war. Freya wages battle on behalf of the oppressed, a warrior in service to others, standing up to injustice. She assists women in labor and those seeking love. She is a death doula, comforting the dying on their transition and transformation. Freya rides a chariot pulled by two black cats ‚Äì a gift from the God of Thunder, Thor. After serving Freya for seven years, the cats were transformed into witches‚Ä¶ disguised as cats; and so, the association between witches and black cats. Work with Freya on your altar with tiger‚Äôs eye, honey or mead, precious metals and in meditation as your guide through personal obstacles or grief, collective conflict, and on the search for community and love. Friday the 13th is the Day of the Goddess ‚Äì the Divine Feminine in her many archetypes. But more on that part later. The number 13 has always been sacred to the Divine Feminine, and those who followed the Lunar calendar and the cycles of Great Cosmic Mother, observed 13 lunar cycles in a year. The solar calendar observes 12 lunar cycles, with a 13th cycle roughly every two and a half years. *Read the rest here: https://monikacarless.com/blog/",,2773,"{'like_count': 923, 'comment_count': 25, 'num_users': 62945}",The Raven and The Mystic,,2023-10-11 21:03:49,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/131991240_236125101221515_3312558827360389476_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=33-GAJ0O1U0AX-GJo6U&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfClHzpfaG3J9NxEksUGjZ434wIkigmQrxFnJRZ6A2Qz4A&oe=657D38CA,https://www.facebook.com/100044720812257/posts/889781205855898,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387755154_889777882522897_6652077312419056376_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=lHTqxNFLGs0AX9-RDP9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCApxxMSrAx2rV0IntJDj4n7qCxlTWYTwF_No9Ri5nfng&oe=652BBAB8

Ilustre, Pres. Roxas ang pagbisita ni Gov. Emmylou ""Lala"" J. Tali√±o-Mendoza kasama ang mga kinatawan mula sa ahensiya ng nasyunal na pamahalaan, departamento ng kapitolyo, at lokal na pamahalaan ng nasabing bayan upang magbigay ng iba't ibang serbisyo sa mamamayan dito. Sa ilalim ng liderato ni Governor Mendoza isinagawa ang ""Serbisyong Totoo Caravan"", alinsunod sa programa ng nasyunal na pamahalaan na wakasan ang insurhensiya sa buong bansa sa pamamagitan ng ""whole-of-nation approach"", na ipinapatupad sa lalawigan sa tulong ng Provincial Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). Sa mensahe ng gobernadora, inihayag nito na seryoso ang kanyang pamunuan na ipaabot sa mga Cotabate√±o, kahit na sa malalayong lugar, ang serbisyo ng gobyerno at ipadama ang malasakit ng pamahalaan upang makamit ang pangmatagalang kapayapaan at kaunlaran. Sa katunanayan, naglaan si Gov. Mendoza ng 50 milyong piso para sa pagtaguyod ng ELCAC program sa lalawigan. Ibinahagi rin ng ina ng probinsya ang kasalukuyang pagsisikap nito para sa mga kapatid na katutubo o indigenous peoples (IPs) ng lalawigan kung saan ""pilot areas"" ang bayan ng Carmen, Banisilan, at Alamada, na mabibigyan ng hanapbuhay sa pamamagitan ng pagtatanim ng kawayan sa 2,000 ektaryang lupain na pag-aari rin ng mga ito. Tinatayang abot sa sampung libong sahod ang tatanggapin ng bawat indibidwal kada buwan. Hinikayat din nito ang mga residente na makiisa sa pamahalaan at maging mata, tenga, at boses ng mamamayan upang masugpo ang katiwalian at maipaabot ang pangangailangan ng taumbayan. Kasama din ng gonernadora si Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Ali B. Abdullah na nagpahayag ng pagsaludo kay Gov. Mendoza sa suporta nito sa naturang adhikain sa pamamagitan ng paglaan ng kaukulang pondo para sa pagsasagawa ng nasabing caravan Ayon kay PD Ali, naging matagumpay ang implementasyon ng ELCAC sa buong lalawigan dahil sa determinisyon ng butihing gobernadora na dalhin ang mga serbisyo ng gobyerno sa komunidad sa pamamagitan ng ST caravan. Mensahe ng paghanga rin ang ipinaabot ni Ginoong Pedro Arnado, dating miyembro ng makakaliwang grupo at ngayon ay bahagi na ng Speakers Bureau ng Armed Forces of the Philippines. Aniya, nakita na nito ang malasakit ng pamahalaan sa mamamayan lalo na sa mga malalayong lugar at maliliit na sektor sa lipunan. Pinasalamatan nito si Gov. Mendoza na ayon sa kanya dahil sa Serbisyong Totoo caravan naihatid ang napakaraming mga serbisyo at mga proyekto sa mga barangay at mga komunidad. Labis din ang saya ng mga lokal na opisyales na pinangunahan nina Mayor Jonathan Mahimpit at Punong Barangay Helen Gasita dahil sa malaking oportunidad na ibinigay sa kanila ng probinsiya upang maging benepisyaryo ng iba't ibang mga programa at proyekto ang mahigit 2,000 na residente rito.

War is not all-powerful, inevitable or unstoppable. Its origins are in the same place as peace: in the human heart. When we pray for peace, we pray to reach the hearts of other human beings, on all sides of the conflict, to restore a sense of compassion and hope. We seek to pour the water of life onto the flames of hate, one person at a time, until the rage subsides. So please, keep praying with me for peace, no matter how tempted you may be to despair.

facebook,"It has been gut wrenching to read about the unprecedented terrorist attacks on the Israeli people. Children decapitated in their beds, 240 young people slaughtered at a music festival for peace, little ones kidnapped and held hostage. My heart breaks for the loss of these precious lives and the fear and unspeakable pain our Jewish brothers and sisters are feeling. It has also been wild to read the justifications, the rationalizations and outright, vile anti-Semitic hate spewed at Israelis during this dark hour. Not just from bots on social media but from Influencers, media groups, celebrities, Harvard student associations, Christian conservatives and more. This is Israel‚Äôs 9/11 - even worse - and yet many have chosen this very moment to publicly side with their killers and downplay their pain. A BLM chapter has even posted an image of a terrorist paraglider with their support for Hamas ‚Äúfreedom fighters.‚Äù Hamas terrorists used paragliders to land in Israeli villages and shoot to death men, women and children. It is all shameful and sick. Denouncing Hamas does not mean you do not have great empathy for the many innocents in Gaza, caught up in this war. My heart also breaks for children caught in cross fire and families terrified as they face rockets, intended for their leaders. Hamas is evil and does not value their precious lives, either. Pray for justice and peace. For the protection of *all* civilians, Israeli and Palestinian, for an end to Hamas and all terrorist overlords, and for a future of flourishing and peace for Israel and the people of Palestine.

Prime Minister Rabuka extends his sincere appreciation to all parties involved in making this mission a success. ‚ÄúIn these trying times, it is important to express our sympathy for all those affected by the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas. Our thoughts are with the people of the region, and we hope for a swift and lasting resolution that brings peace and stability to all,‚Äù Prime Minister Rabuka said. The Prime Minister acknowledges the tireless efforts of the Fiji Airways crew and Incident Team who worked diligently to navigate the complex risks and options associated with planning this crucial flight. ‚ÄúTheir dedication and expertise have made this mission possible and have reunited our citizens with their families and loved ones. This mission is a historic one for the Fijian Government, as it represents our very first rescue operation.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe successful repatriation of our citizens is a testament to the commitment and determination of our nation to safeguard the well-being of all Fijians, no matter where they are in the world.‚Äù The Prime Minister also extended his gratitude to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their coordination and arrangements with our international allies. ‚ÄúThis collaboration and support from our friends and partners have been instrumental in ensuring the safe return of our citizens.‚Äù The Prime Minister would also like to express his heartfelt thanks to all those who offered their prayers, well-wishes, and support during this mission. ‚ÄúThe collective strength of our nation in times of need is a source of great pride and unity.

facebook,"‚ÄúI am the living one. I died, but look‚ÄîI am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and the grave.‚Äù ‚ÄîRevelation 1:18 When Christ was born in Bethlehem, the angels appeared to some shepherds nearby and said, ‚ÄúGlory to God in highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased‚Äù (Luke 2:14 NLT). Jesus came to bring peace on earth. The Antichrist, however, will come to take peace from the earth. And here‚Äôs what we need to know: Satan is behind all the wars and struggles on this planet. We‚Äôre understandably perplexed when we hear about barbaric acts of war and terrorism. The network pundits try to explain it. But the reason people do these horrible things is because there is a devil. And the devil loves violence and war. He loves carnage and death. We‚Äôve had some massive wars in our world‚Äôs history. There was World War I, which was called the war to end all wars. But it took only twenty years for another conflict to develop, and World War II was far worse, with even more casualties. And the worst wars are yet to come. Concerning the end of the age, Jesus said, ‚ÄúAnd you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come‚Äù (Matthew 24:6‚Äì8 NLT). Here‚Äôs the bottom line: God always has the last word. Sometimes things look bleak, and we have setback after setback. We say, ‚ÄúI thought God‚Äôs Word would prevail.‚Äù It will in time. God will have the last word.

facebook,"Isaiah 52:7 How beautiful on the mountains, are the feet of those who brings good news, who proclaim peace, and brings good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who proclaims Zion your God reigns! Heavenly father, we thank you for an opportunity to come before your presence, to pray for all of those who are being affected by the conflict between Hamas and Israel. Father, we know that you are soon to return and your desire is that none should perish and all to come to the knowledge of your truth. We pray for the people in the Middle East. Yahovah you are the true and living God. Your name has been proclaimed from generation to generation you are the ‚ÄúGreat I Am‚Äù. You have established your truth in the Earth and you change not. And you have said that ‚Äúevery‚Äù knee will bow, and ‚Äúevery‚Äù tongue will confess that Yeshua is Lord!! We pray right now, that, even in the midst of the situation in the Middle East, that your loving kindness is preparing the way for a revival amongst the people. We pray that you will soften the hearts of the people, that they may know you for themselves. We pray that you would give them a visitation an encounter with your truth. We pray for revival to break forth in that land. We pray that every ‚Äú living WORD seed‚Äùthat has been planted over the years, and all those whose life has been cut down because they spoke your name will be remembered by you for their unwavering love for you. Many have stood declaring who you are inspite of the out come. May each sacrifice and blood shed seed begin to bud and bloom and produce ‚Äúfruit‚Äù.  You have had those who love you and know you walk across those lands. You have done great and mighty works in generations past In that land, you have heard the cries of your people, answers are coming to pass. We know you have not forgotten your promises, and we pray that they will begin to manifest in this season. Father, we don‚Äôt understand all that is happening because we know that you‚Äôre always doing something beyond what we see. We with our natural eyes see things one way, but you and your infinite wisdom sees things a completely different way. We glorify you in all things, we lift you up above all things, and we declare that you are the God of all nations and all peoples. Let your will be done in the Middle East, let your power be seen among the heathens. Father we know you hold the outcome, because nothing is wasted with you, you have complete control in this conflict. We thank you, we praise you and most of all we trust you for there‚Äôs nothing that takes you by surprise. You are the beginning and you are the end of all things. In Yeshua‚Äôs Mighty Name we üôèüèΩ Pray Amen!",,2227,"{'like_count': 1439, 'comment_count': 144, 'num_users': 183}",The Sacredness Of Prayer,,2023-10-11 11:11:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/327317062_733440395161539_7175220868756759928_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Om-dPETRLm0AX-YAJLs&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBrCxgSib8fUHy92P8zzoyqMb1zcOPHPbujElRhqP1pRA&oe=6559C98A,https://www.facebook.com/100065041531878/posts/697326342445411,
facebook,"üé•: BLOOD (2015) ‚òë: TAGALOG DUBBED ‚òë: COMPLETED ____________________ JOIN MY GROUP https://facebook.com/groups/245546727277999/ Plot Park Ji Sang is a doctor specializing in hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery in the best cancer research hospital in the country. He is also a vampire. Despite seeming cold and unfeeling, Ji Sang masks his soft heart and inner pain and yearns for closeness with people. He believes very strongly in the sanctity of human life and suppresses his thirst for blood to treat terminally ill patients and save lives. Among his colleagues is Yoo Ri Ta, a hotshot physician who entered medical school at the age of 17 and is also the niece of the chaebol group chairman who owns the hospital. Ri Ta is highly capable but snooty and prideful, yet Ji Sang finds himself falling for her. He also gets drawn into a conflict between good and evil as he encounters Lee Jae Wook, a two-faced hospital chief who gains everyone's trust with his gentle demeanor, but inwardly harbors a dangerous ambition for power and a talent for cruelty.

facebook,"The Mole: Bulldogs meeting to decide Josh Addo-Carr's future after 'dramatic' week Josh Addo-Carr will sit down with Bulldogs officials on Friday in a meeting that could have dramatic implications for the star winger's future. Rumours are swirling throughout the game that 'The Foxx' wants out of Belmore after a dramatic week in which he was suspended from the Australian team and forced to apologise for a social media post concerning the crisis in the Middle East. Addo-Carr and his management will meet with Bulldogs football boss Phil Gould to sort out where the tryscoring ace stands. Sources close to Addo-Carr say he isn't happy with the level of support given to him after he was suspended for two matches after video emerged of him punching a man during the Koori Knockout. The Bulldogs, for their part, are said to be unhappy with Addo-Carr's behaviour at the Knockout and his social media post on the Israel-Palestine conflict. The star winger put a photo on Instagram of the Palestinian and Aboriginal flags with the caption ""One struggle, one fight"". The following day he did a backflip - no doubt at the request of Bulldogs and NRL officials, stating he wanted to apologise ""for any offence I have caused due to my recent social media post"". ""As a proud First Nations man, I saw a message of support against displacement and land rights, and I shared this without full consideration to, or understanding of, the current events happening overseas,"" he added. On the field, The Foxx has been a success in his two seasons at Canterbury after five years in Melbourne. In a struggling side, he still managed to score 16 tries last year and 11 tries in 2023. But he came to the club on big dollars and the Bulldogs would be able to use that money on players closer to the middle of the park if he left with two years remaining on his contract. Several rival NRL clubs are certain to be interested in the speedy winger - if he cannot resolve his issues with the Bulldogs on Friday.",,1773,"{'like_count': 301, 'comment_count': 1076, 'num_users': 100098}",Bulldogs 4 Life,,2023-10-11 20:27:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338035587_2920225021442036_1194138958643389704_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=aHpm4GSrchoAX-wicOk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCiJq3wm1ICbqU08brE6AkgAw_g33mdzxC-imarHM2YuA&oe=655AC5EF,https://www.facebook.com/100075896211285/posts/344533934753144,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387207528_344533888086482_3907095875175144910_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=J9KZeUSs_wYAX9BQDXy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBWGofYEn1UpfNSRozte9Y55u4LW_bBYyZoR_hYQ3DWJQ&oe=652BB1D5

OCTOBER 11,2023
The Glorious Mystery ( Wednesdays and Sundays) 

Special Intention :

Let us offer our prayer today for peace in Israel - Gaza conflict, and prayers to all victims of war, to those who died, may their souls rest in peace. üôèüèª

‚úùÔ∏èIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

‚úùÔ∏èSay the Apostles Creed: I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son, Our Lord; Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

‚úùÔ∏èOne Our Father, three Hail Marys, one Glory Be to the Father.

‚úùÔ∏èThe First Glorious Mystery - The Resurrection of Jesus. If the Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from death, lives in you, then he who raised Christ from death will also give life to your mortal bodies by the presence of his Spirit in you. (Romans 8:11).

On Sunday morning the women came to the tomb to embalm the body of our Lord. While on the way, they looked and were astonished that the stone had been rolled away. It seemed that Jesus Christ had lost the battle. But the fact is that He won! Jesus conquered the darkest realities of sin and death by the power of His resurrection. 

The Glory Realized. Jesus, your victory over sin and death is real. Yet this world seems so caught up in tragedies which give the illusion that darkness is winning. Increase our faith so that we can know that the victory is ours. Through the Eucharist, Your Word, and the Church, help us to grow in Your love.

‚úùÔ∏èThe Second Glorious Mystery - The Ascension of Jesus. As he was blessing them, he departed from them and was taken up into heaven. (Luke 24:51). Jesus ascended to the right hand of the Father. He promised us that we would not be alone and that He would be with us all days, even to the end of time. Jesus goes to the Father to intercede for us and to prepare a place for us.

We Can Do All Things. Jesus, You promised that Your power would work in us if we believe. ""You will do greater things than these because I go to the Father."" It is precisely because You are at the right hand of the Father that we experience Your presence and power in our lives.

‚úùÔ∏èThe Third Glorious Mystery - The Gift of the Holy Spirit. When the day of Pentecost came, all the believers were gathered together in one place. Suddenly there was a noise from the sky that sounded like a strong wind blowing, and it filled the whole house. (Acts 2:1-2).

The disciples were gathered together in prayer and the Blessed Mother was in their midst. All of a sudden the Holy Spirit came in the form of fire upon all those gathered in prayer. People from different countries and backgrounds were all united by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Inner Strength. Lord Jesus, You were able to transform Peter. The one who denied you could now stand tall. Send forth Your Holy Spirit upon the Church so that we, too, may be restored and renewed. Let Your Spirit fill our hearts with praise and adoration. Make us bold in proclaiming the trust of our faith in You.

‚úùÔ∏èThe Fourth Glorious Mystery - The Assumption of Mary. She was given the two wings of a large eagle, in order to fly to her place in the desert, where she will be taken care of . . . safe from the dragon's attack. (Revelation 12:14). 

Being raised to heaven, body and soul. Mary is at the right hand of Jesus. Jesus is at the right hand of the Father. Mary is in an unique place to intercede for us. She is in union with the Blessed Trinity by the grace of God.

Future Dignity. Mary, the gift that you received was a gift for the Church. It brings us hope and comfort to know that God is providing for our eternal life. Mary, help us not to focus on passing pleasures, but rather to set our hearts on the will of the Father!

facebook,"#OP1095 We've got a panel featuring a Celestial Dragon and those 6 tantalizing boxes. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that the Marines managed to regain this prized Devil Fruit and are now using it as a reward for the victor of the God Valley Tournament. The implications of this revelation are staggering. If the Gomu Gomu no Mi is indeed one of the rewards, this could set the stage for a dramatic confrontation. Luffy, the current user of this legendary Devil Fruit, may find himself up against powerful opponents who are eager to claim this treasure for themselves. **Or these are all special devil fruits that are already possessed by powerful characters in the series. (Gomu no mi not included)** This theory draws parallels to the Dressrosa Arc, where the ultimate prize was the Flame-Flame Fruit, the Devil Fruit once wielded by the late Portgas D. Ace. If history is repeating itself, then these Devil Fruits could become the central point of a massive conflict, with pirates, revolutionaries, and even the World Government vying for these mysterious powers.",,1159,"{'like_count': 465, 'comment_count': 165, 'num_users': 401713}",ONE PIECE : Kaizoku-≈ç Designs,,2023-10-11 11:58:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/372823437_1458480824941527_1956614454746663811_n.png?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=02Kruc-11JgAX81mx84&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAjhIhe9lH_RQYRjadbiPMJtTGiAEqOmtGAbXVgIo_Hng&oe=6559BA8C,https://www.facebook.com/groups/773578003467786/permalink/1548471752645070,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387819988_175713605583556_5186282815692778206_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=S9Rje0BPfxMAX_KOpUK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDH5gD7gQdUN5k2AsM7xZxS5ulu9XbaSZ9vYavx_Ch7oA&oe=652B04BC

facebook,"Belizeans in Israel During Hamas-Israel Conflict On Saturday morning, the terrorist organization Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. Gunmen breached security barriers and over two thousand missiles were launched from Gaza. Hours after the Palestinian attack, Israel‚Äôs air force retaliated with air raids in Gaza. Over sixteen hundred people have been killed in the war during the course of the last four days. The decades old conflict has reached yet another breaking point. A Belizean couple touring Israel with a group of friends was in Tel Aviv, Israel when the first rounds of missiles were launched from Gaza. Those rockets landed some forty miles from where they were staying, but they heard the sirens and the blasts. Shelly Usher, a resident of Belmopan, told us that everyone around them were in panic.

facebook,"NEW PODCAST EPISODE! I first spoke to today‚Äôs guest back in March of this year (episode 342) - and it‚Äôs become one of the most downloaded episodes of the year, transforming the lives of many women - and men, I might add! I think today‚Äôs NEW episode is going to do the same. Dr Mindy Pelz is a nutrition expert and pioneer on the subject of women‚Äôs health & hormones. Her aim is to EMPOWER women by explaining the biological changes that take place each month and throughout a woman‚Äôs life; she believes that, armed with that knowledge, they can IMPROVE their health, happiness and relationships. During this INCREDIBLE episode, we discuss: üëâüèæ Whether weight gain is inevitable as we age. Is it our fate ‚Äì and particularly a woman‚Äôs fate ‚Äì to gain weight once she hits 40? üëâüèæ How to adjust when and what you eat during different phases of your cycle and the importance of gut health when thinking about hormonal health. üëâüèæ Why women often handle stress in a different way than men, the impact that hormonal changes can have on brain function and the best times in a woman‚Äôs cycle to resolve conflict and deal with relationship issues. üëâüèæ Why declining levels of progesterone (the calming hormone) can result in lower-quality sleep and the practical steps we can ALL take to improve our sleep And so MUCH more! This is an episode jam-packed with insightful information and practical take-homes. And it is just as important for MEN as it is for WOMEN. Leave a ‚ù§Ô∏è below if you‚Äôll be tuning in.

facebook,"255 Fijians Embark on Historic Repatriation Journey 11 October, 2023 - With a sense of gratitude, Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka is relieved that a chartered Fiji Airways flight that departed from Ben Gurion Airport earlier today, is successfully bringing 255 Fijians back to their homeland. Among the passengers were Fiji's AICAT (Agricultural Institutes of the Center for Agricultural Technology) students who were pursuing studies in agriculture in Israel, the 200 Fijians who had journeyed to Jerusalem to partake in the Feast of Tabernacles as well as a group of Pacific Islanders. Prime Minister Rabuka extends his sincere appreciation to all parties involved in making this mission a success. ‚ÄúIn these trying times, it is important to express our sympathy for all those affected by the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas. Our thoughts are with the people of the region, and we hope for a swift and lasting resolution that brings peace and stability to all,‚Äù Prime Minister Rabuka said. The Prime Minister acknowledges the tireless efforts of the Fiji Airways crew and Incident Team who worked diligently to navigate the complex risks and options associated with planning this crucial flight. ‚ÄúTheir dedication and expertise have made this mission possible and have reunited our citizens with their families and loved ones. This mission is a historic one for the Fijian Government, as it represents our very first rescue operation.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe successful repatriation of our citizens is a testament to the commitment and determination of our nation to safeguard the well-being of all Fijians, no matter where they are in the world.‚Äù The Prime Minister also extended his gratitude to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their coordination and arrangements with our international allies. ‚ÄúThis collaboration and support from our friends and partners have been instrumental in ensuring the safe return of our citizens.‚Äù The Prime Minister would also like to express his heartfelt thanks to all those who offered their prayers, well-wishes, and support during this mission. ‚ÄúThe collective strength of our nation in times of need is a source of great pride and unity. The safe return of these Fijians is a testament to the resilience of our nation, and the Fijian spirit that binds us together. We will continue to work diligently to ensure the well-being and safety of all Fijians, both at home and abroad.‚Äù PC: Kelepi Abariga",,1008,"{'like_count': 456, 'comment_count': 53, 'num_users': 173372}",Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka,,2023-10-11 07:32:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/381639662_857937645689814_2843393478418721314_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=kjHPxG7yMusAX8GnRM1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAULudBo20qTWaDYj52yQRvfA9rGoWrQojDBFz9Ta_ltw&oe=655AEB73,https://www.facebook.com/100044207600846/posts/867438271406418,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391511959_867438298073082_671448547657467713_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=EtuUiFB4gtIAX9f6Apb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA7P0lL7kX0jbWouZxnHjEUyEAFXkowW-YPZSpuyzDypg&oe=652C22B4
facebook,"I have some very personal requests and I‚Äôd appreciate it if you could grant me them. Help me help you. I am trying my hardest to do my work here. I know I am channeling Ari. I feel him in my soul. But I am one person. As of 5 minutes ago, I have a colleague taking over two of my platforms so hopefully today will be more manageable than yesterday. But there are some things that will truly make this a lot easier for me. Here are some requests: - Do NOT send me gruesome pictures, videos, or posts about the atrocities. If you think that triggers you, I promise you, you cannot imagine what it does to me. Just don‚Äôt send them to me. Yes I know you believe the world needs to see them. Not debating you but I can‚Äôt handle it. It destroys my soul. - Unless there is something super urgent that needs my help, don‚Äôt send me bad news. Trust me, I know how bad it is. I really don‚Äôt need messages telling me about the family or that family or how other armies are joining against us. Assume I see what I need to see and unless it‚Äôs something urgent, just don‚Äôt send me bad news. - Do NOT send me things to share unless it‚Äôs urgent, it‚Äôs something I can share that will inspire people, or some very good news you think I haven‚Äôt seen. I am getting multiple requests a minute to share. And then when I say no (I don‚Äôt ignore people. If I don‚Äôt answer a message, it‚Äôs because I missed it.) people get offended. I can‚Äôt waste time on that if I‚Äôm going to continue my work. Please don‚Äôt misunderstand the request as me thinking what you‚Äôre asking for is not important. It‚Äôs all important but I can‚Äôt share everything. So please don‚Äôt ask me to share things unless it meets the criteria above. - Don‚Äôt send me extremely long texts unless you must, and if you must, say in the beginning what you need so I can see if it‚Äôs even relevant before I spend five minutes reading the rest. Every minute counts. - Don‚Äôt send me voice notes. I have to stop working to listen to them. Text. Again, unless you absolutely must. - Don‚Äôt ask me for updates. I have been in touch with about 10 different sources that allow me to share things as they unfold before the news, so I can share real time updates. Don‚Äôt ask. Read my posts. Especially on X. @Hilzfuld. I am updating there by the second. - Don‚Äôt send me links to accounts spreading hate. I don‚Äôt want to see that and I cannot spend time reporting hundreds of accounts. I‚Äôm already trying to do my best on X and I‚Äôm trying directly through Elon Musk. So far unsuccessfully. - Don‚Äôt ask me how you can help. I don‚Äôt know. See the comments on this post for some ideas: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10169138284595377&id=749800376&mibextid=cr9u03 I don‚Äôt have high up contacts at Elal and the ones I do are incredibly bombarded and cannot help with individual cases. Please don‚Äôt ask. - Don‚Äôt send me random links without an explanation of what it is. I assume if someone sends me something, I need to watch/read it and if it‚Äôs irrelevant, I just wasted time I could have used to continue defending Israel. Listen, I am spending all day on X, here, Instagram, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp doing my best to defend Israel online and to do whatever I can to save lives and inform the world. I didn‚Äôt put my phone down yesterday for 10 hours straight. I can‚Äôt know if my posts are changing opinions but they are reaching millions (before the war; never had a tweet reach even close to a million and now many of them are hitting millions, one about to hit 7 million) and the feedback I‚Äôm getting is very meaningful. The feedback is coming from people, from the highest ranks in the IDF, and from the government. I cannot stop no matter what. I need to continue full steam ahead and anything that stops me or slows me down is causing real damage. I truly hope this post didn‚Äôt offend anyone. I am really trying to use every second of the day to channel Ari asking myself over and over WWAD, What Would Ari Do? Having said all that, if you have any doubt of whether to send me something that you‚Äôre not sure if I need to see or not, assuming it doesn‚Äôt meet some of the negative criteria above (like gruesome videos), then send it but please include a sentence of what it is. Also, if you have an idea for me of how to be more effective in my work, you can leave it here in the comments. I can use all the help I can get. I read every single comment, message, reply, and share of my posts. Or at least I try to. If I missed yours, then know it was not intentional (unless it‚Äôs a nasty comment). Finally, and it boggles my mind that I have to ask this, please do not send me messages to debate me on the conflict, on the war, on Israel‚Äôs strategy, or anything else. No time to debate now and I‚Äôm not sure why people feel the need to send me messages that I shouldn‚Äôt rejoice in the elimination of our enemy. By the way, almost all of the above apply to other people too, not only me. Just remember that we‚Äôre all doing our best and you should too.

facebook,"Dear proper_naija_boy, Thank you for your feedback. Bethlehem, where Yeshua (Jesus) was born, Jericho, Hebron, and many other cities Christians go to for pilgrimage are in Palestine. Nazareth, where Yeshua lived, is one of the largest Palestinian cities, but it is politically in Israel, because of the way the post conflict map was drawn. Almost 100% of the population of Nazareth are Palestinians. They are the ones looking after the suspected site of Yeshua's home. They have NEVER desecrated it one day. Many of the holy sites are in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Yeshua was baptised in Jordan, not Israel. The people looking after those Christian pilgrimage sites are Muslims. And they permit free snd unfettered access to Christians and followers of Yeshua. I have visited all these countries and places, including Egypt. Gaza is between Egypt and Israel. Gaza was where the Ethiopian eunuch received Christ in Acts chapter 8. I am an eyewitness. Palestinians are more receptive to Christians than Israelis. Palestinians speak Arabic but are not Arabs.

facebook,"I am opposed to plans for a blanket ban on Palestinian Australians gathering in NSW in support of their people. The civilian suffering in the conflict is universal, and we should not have the right to deny Australians the ability to peacefully assemble. Leaders within the Palestinian community, including religious institutions, need to come out strongly to rebuke calls for violence and condemn the slaughter of innocent civilians by Hamas. The government and police need to work with organizers to prevent the celebration of terrorism against civilians and take direct action against any incitement to violence. Any display of support for terrorism must be dealt with swiftly. If organizers are unable to do this and are not confident that their presence may not further inflame the situation, they should take matters into their own hands to minimize the damage this will do to their cause publicly in Australia. It is their responsibility, and the rest of the country has every right to judge their actions on the day. If the ban stays in place and a protest led by the same organizers goes ahead and we see the same scenes as the other night in front of the Opera House but this time with clashes with police, the damage to the perception of Palestinian people in Australia will be immense. Australians should always have every right to oppose war and advocate for peace.

facebook,"People ask me all the time if I am ""pro-Israel"" because I am a Jew who has lived in Israel, and my answer is that being ""pro-Israel"" or being ""pro-Palestine"" or being a ""Zionist"" does not properly capture the nuance of thought most people do or should have about this issue. It certainly doesn't capture mine. I have a lot to say. I‚Äôve spent the last 72 hours writing, texting, and talking to Israelis, Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians. Much of my reaction is going to piss off people on ""both sides,"" but I am exhausted and hurting and I do not think there is any way to discuss this situation without being radically honest about my views. So I'm going to try to say what I believe to be true the best I can. Let me start with this: It could have been me. That's a hard thought to shake when watching the videos out of Israel ‚Äî the concert goers fleeing across an empty expanse, the hostages being paraded through the streets, the people shot in the head at bus stops or in their cars. I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured. I don‚Äôt believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They're doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They're doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood ‚Äî an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic ‚Äî it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it. It‚Äôs not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should ‚Äî far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I'll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me. In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it‚Äôs messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they‚Äôd later try to renege on ‚Äî all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948. That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas ‚Äî like Alaska ‚Äî or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn‚Äôt want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel. The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react the same way. So, just as humans have done forever, they fought. The many existing Arab states turned against the burgeoning new Jewish state. One side won and one side lost. This is the brutal and broken and violent world we live in, but it is what created the global world order we have now. Are Israelis and British people ""colonizers"" because of this 20th century history? Sure. But that view flattens thousands of years of history and conflict, and the context of World War I and World War II. I don‚Äôt view Israelis and Brits as colonizers any more than the Assyrians or the Babylonians or the (truncated)",,863,"{'like_count': 300, 'comment_count': 298, 'num_users': 1686}",Tangle,,2023-10-11 19:07:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/360086554_731307422337992_6450786058732201046_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nyCiuf9n5UMAX9Jt2J4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCs9mU4M7N02jaId4sTc80xgMA0JXApI7fXqzcKbzc6vg&oe=655AEB58,https://www.facebook.com/100063762210250/posts/792035292931871,

As of today, we have decided to deploy the workhorse BCS150 back into the world tour schedule. She has about 5 weeks of work to be ready, as well as the L&H 33 that was beat up pretty bad earlier this year in Brazil, lots of damage from running her hard. Actually we ran that 33 2600nm miles on plane in 15-25 knot seas, not counting the trolling miles. Even the tower legs are cracked and need welding. She will be made to be better than before and with her Simrad SY50 sonar tuned up, plus installing a Starlink so we may broadcast live from Ascensions to you devoted and crazy followers. Will do the South Atlantic run Jan to April on the 150/33, then reevaluate based on the status of the 175 at that time. Given the conflict with Israel, the option of the 175 heading to the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean is no longer possible. We‚Äôll focus on South Atlantic with the 150/33 January to April, worry about the rest of the year later.

facebook,"I‚Äôm tired. Give out. Not just from the day, but from the battle. I‚Äôm weary. It would be easy not to take a stand, but I can‚Äôt live with myself if I do that. Let me explain what has worn me down. And I do this to tell you that you, too, must be strong. yesterday I made clear that onion rings can never be ordered as a substitute for french fries. That is never a choice. Onion rings can only be in addition to french fries. You can choose not to order french fries and get nothing, but you can‚Äôt choose between those two. if you‚Äôve ordered french fries and you want onion rings in addition, I salute you. I understand. If you‚Äôre with your wife or a friend or your kids and you‚Äôve ordered meals that come with fries and you order an onion ring to share, you were raised right. I knew when I said this that I was picking a scab for the wound of American society. I guess I did not expect big onion ring to come after me. An army of onion ring minions has been attacking me by emails. Mercilessly. Repeatedly. And onslaught of the onion ring army. they don‚Äôt seem to understand the rules. I can only assume they were not raised right. They are bringing this battle to my doorstep. And I will fight them until the death. Because it is the right thing to do. Never avoid conflict.  in this case it would simply be kicking the can down the road until they bolster their resources and come at you later. No matter the cost, no matter how high the Burden I must bear, this is a fight I cannot avoid, and I will win it. be strong.",,797,"{'like_count': 235, 'comment_count': 209, 'num_users': 349139}",Michael Berry,,2023-10-11 03:59:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/182676180_314811040014281_4359381691833598932_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=IYPkopEJiFcAX-u-fMD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMPLFUscpWczb_6-qAfQEgmnPneht12DQXIKY1o9g56Q&oe=657D124E,https://www.facebook.com/100044561613988/posts/867146534780726,

facebook,"Hours after the Fiji Airways flight, carrying more than 200 passengers, including Fijians, departed from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, reports emerged that Hamas‚Äô Al-Qassam had fired multiple rockets toward the airport. As a result, all aircraft landings were denied due to the prevailing danger, and planes were either diverted or instructed to circle the area. Departures from Israel‚Äôs Ben Gurion Airport were also temporarily suspended. The reports come as the chartered Fiji Airways flight passengers including those who had traveled to Jerusalem to participate in the Feast of Tabernacles, amongst them the paramount chief of the Burebasaga Confederacy Marama Na Gone Marama Bale na Roko Tui Dreketi Ro Teimumu Kepa. The returning contingent included local students studying agriculture in Israel and Pacific Islanders who were also part of the pilgrim tour. They were warmly welcomed by family and friends upon their arrival at around 3am today at Nadi Airport. Fiji‚Äôs Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, and Fiji Airways‚Äô Managing Director and CEO Andre Viljoen, were also present at the airport to greet the passengers. The original plan was for the group to depart from Fiji on October 11, but due to the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas, they had to leave one day earlier than scheduled. https://maitvfiji.com/passengers-on-fiji-airways-flight-return-home-safely-as-ben-gurion-airport-is-fired-at/ #Fiji #FijiNews",,772,"{'like_count': 325, 'comment_count': 38, 'num_users': 169117}",Mai TV,,2023-10-11 22:08:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/230416410_4173618739341988_5495688366789715583_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cRxGqYWaPwMAX9U9jKo&_nc_oc=AQloL9QoKgSTczARWUGCeVlj_C5pA4pcqk8RWr382LCBUlyqIRLQ0h8TOIKie8QIg0E&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDDyg88J9ywQA0-AA3c61u5HhZfVSqG0tejQIbxYr7GtA&oe=6559E21A,https://www.facebook.com/100063766493086/posts/815222807279928,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387028936_815222863946589_5644166322421480739_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=lCmjDY3y9jwAX8GsZ0d&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDfW_apd_xUw7Lg2Stc3tRPRqaieYdKSh087ZHKjheFNA&oe=652B9282

facebook,"Prior to Hamas's surprise attack from the Gaza Strip on October 7, at least 240 Palestinians, including 44 children, had been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers in 2023. That's almost 1 person killed per day. ""You cannot commit daily violence against Palestinians,"" says Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi, and ""expect that not to lead to a reaction. The reaction will be violent. The reaction sometimes may include things that are unquestionably war crimes.""

facebook,"Several emails have come in reprimanding us because, they say, we‚Äôre not requesting prayer for the Palestinian Christians, or showing love for them. Ok, we are stressing that people pray for Israel. Why? Because that‚Äôs what the Word of God instructs believers to do. Aside from that, we have not talked specifically about Palestinian or Israeli Christians; we have focused on the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the aggressors in this conflict. One Israeli citizen interviewed by Fox News said Americans need to understand that ‚Äúeverybody in Israel either had a friend who died or knows someone who has a friend or family member who was died or kidnapped ‚Ä¶. Nobody is unaffected.‚Äù Think of that‚Äîeverybody in Israel. The stories coming out from the Israeli military and what they found inside the homes of innocent civilians, including little babies who were beheaded, are stomach-turning. This is evil unhinged, and it‚Äôs indefensible. Yet we have Rep. Rashida Tlaib flying a Palestinian flag outside her official congressional office, and college students on campuses like Harvard saying that Israel deserves the blame for being attacked by Hamas. Unbelievable. These people need to wake up and understand that these terrorist groups hate America, and I am just very concerned that any day now, America is going to face the same thing that Israel is dealing with now.",,718,"{'like_count': 269, 'comment_count': 153, 'num_users': 63841}",Frances Swaggart,,2023-10-11 18:43:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/354047740_803605414460254_6487698184804158239_n.jpg?stp=c3.194.1035.1035a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=o1-H7AXIhOMAX9gU_fA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAcTVqy5HIa5zrQmptetTE5iS2o1MADb9LYpqH9SgoKfA&oe=655B1066,https://www.facebook.com/100044324085366/posts/864622558358539,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391701550_864622495025212_7240298641573189420_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bkH0kWSblxcAX_beP24&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCEdoodSK6rBpYkBWYe_XOvYlW2LuUTZ3t33zR9RnXdWQ&oe=652BD912

We also wholly reject the violations to which the country's male and female citizens are exposed, their exposure to killing, forced displacement, and their loss of their livelihoods, their money, and everything they possess, without any right or consideration given to them by both sides of the conflict. Weapons do not bring peace, and wars do not lead to safety. Most wars ended with peace agreements but with heavy loss of life and complete destruction of the economy in the country. Sudan and its citizens have reached their worst since the beginning of this war. Therefore, this war must stop immediately. Strength does not lie in those who win the war, but weakness is always in those who lose peace. To the honourable People's Armed Forces in our national institutions, know well that our position on this accursed war is not against you, but it is against your leaders and against everyone who harms the soil and citizens of this country and whom we know very well does not care about the peace of this country and the safety of its people. No to war is our stance for the sake of Sudan first and the citizens second, and this is what you have given an oath to and what we swore to in our glorious revolution, which we sacrificed with precious blood for all of us... __________________________ _#Know well that we are in the same trench... _ ‚Åß‚Ä´#ÿßŸÑÿØÿπŸÖ_ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ±Ÿäÿπ_Ÿäÿ≠ÿßÿ±ÿ®_ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿßÿ∑ŸÜŸäŸÜ‚Ä¨‚Å© #ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿ©_ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸäÿ©_ÿ™ŸÜÿ∏ŸäŸÖ_ÿßÿ±Ÿáÿßÿ®Ÿä #ŸÑÿßÿ≤ŸÖ_ÿ™ŸÇŸäŸÅ #ŸÑÿß_ŸÑŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ÿ® ‚Å¶‚Ä™#RSF_FIGHTS_CITIZES",,649,"{'like_count': 363, 'comment_count': 104, 'num_users': 294141}",ŸÖŸàÿ¨Ÿà ÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ≥ - Mujo Press,,2023-10-11 12:00:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/301982952_639089850900934_3752268357843943111_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LnC07Wc79YcAX9Z_n8F&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDGUnYMlXCSk8xWiBGu3J7dcJQ8rV1BMnYRbAKybe-HTQ&oe=655A694B,https://www.facebook.com/100063687034961/posts/802434621889432,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387789413_802434488556112_1115016677059215529_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=pFyzlJeA7gsAX9sUm09&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCdWsD6DS0rRZXNBS37qqTKYMKRNlLrTH8qh2iSN_ufww&oe=652BD2F9

Artifact: Clay prism Provenience: Nineveh iraq Period: Neo-Assyrian (ca. 911-612 BC) Current location: British Museum London Text genre language Royal inscription Akkadian The Taylor Prism is a large (38.5 cm high) six-sided clay document which contains the annals of Sennacherib, written down in 691 BC. The prism was discovered in the ruins of the armoury in Nineveh, where it would likely have been deposited in the foundations. The artifact was acquired by the British Consul in Baghdad Col. R. Taylor in 1830 and subsequently donated to the British Museum, where it has remained. As one of the earliest, longest cuneiform texts to be discovered it played a significant role in deciphering and understanding Akkadian cuneiform. The document is most celebrated outside of assyriology for its account of the siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC. King Hezekiah of Judah is said to have been locked up like a bird in a cage in Jerusalem his royal city The account details the destruction 46 towns in Judah the payment of a heavy tribute by Sennacherib, and the deportation of 200,150 people This was one of the first cuneiform texts discovered to provide historians with a welcome opportunity to examine stories from both sides of an ancient military conflict",,644,"{'like_count': 504, 'comment_count': 34, 'num_users': 50620}",Baghdad heritage ÿ™ÿ±ÿßÿ´ ÿ®ÿ∫ÿØÿßÿØ,,2023-10-11 16:24:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/386227720_711769647642384_8911996996744854963_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2VOfPIjlIssAX9sfyo6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB0hoYcfr-m42TmqiPhd7BtDJIz2C8HgosPhmVD-svmCg&oe=655B63C1,https://www.facebook.com/100064280665689/posts/717281147091234,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387836832_717281087091240_2959781383117318847_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=U-9xNzFCHGUAX8BhFYZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDlLy6AL8QnBfCutwt2PXQ-VPd0B2t3xYi5S4Nim1bPwA&oe=6556EC1D

facebook,"2M people live in Gaza. There‚Äôs no route in or out for them, and yet, Israel is about to undertake a ‚Äúcomplete siege‚Äù. Gaza is home to more than 2 million Palestinians ‚Äî 1.7 million of whom are Palestinian refugees, according to UNRWA, the U.N. Palestinian relief agency. The charity Save the Children says children make up almost half of Gaza's population. 1M children. The USA is currently trying to organise a humanitarian corridor through Egypt, but nothing has been agreed yet. My question is this. What happens to those people in the event that the United States is unable to organise such a corridor? What happens to the 1M children, whose entire lives have been spent in an open-air prison. No way in, or out. Nowhere to seek further refuge. I haven‚Äôt heard one serious, sensible, or objective discussion take place on this issue since this wicked and disgusting conflict began. Whatever your views on this, the sad truth is that it‚Äôs only likely to get worse. More bloodshed, more innocent lives lost, and more people with political agendas leveraging this conflict to further their cause. I was almost too afraid to post this, because the last few days have seen, in my view, some of the most toxic and divisive social media pile-ons I‚Äôve ever seen. We‚Äôve hit rock bottom in the online political space. The right wing is ignoring the fact that Palestinian people aren‚Äôt all Hamas, and that showing regard for them doesn‚Äôt make people terrorist sympathisers. The left wing only talks about Palestinians, often ignoring the grotesque massacre that took place. It‚Äôs a worrying place for our society to be in. If we are unable to have a serious and genuine conversation, without the loaded political point scoring, we are in a worse place than I thought. Some of the world‚Äôs top politicians have, over the last few decades, attempted to solve this conflict. They have all failed. Though people aren‚Äôt going to solve it on Twitter, it‚Äôs still important to learn, and be on top of developments. That said, when the content is just videos of victims being dragged around, the value of the discussion is diminished. I sign on to Twitter and find myself feeling physically sick at some of the stuff being shared there. I hope a humanitarian route is made possible soon, for the sake of those innocent people caught up in this. And to the perpetrators, I hope you pay for what you‚Äôve done!",,632,"{'like_count': 301, 'comment_count': 116, 'num_users': 118800}",Jack Dart,,2023-10-11 17:00:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/382770545_871137577715466_4218955790090543018_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4q2cc1lPj-gAX8IHKGg&_nc_oc=AQkt79tQhSqCaPCMOBPv6_i2sDPWH4MIyuq15l0oi8ZyW5QaWfWIJWh12iVoguEURHM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCIg1Wm8b2_6SeUKFULzqPQOchDnYDyW2NrJHQphWLAwg&oe=6559F0BD,https://www.facebook.com/100044576942927/posts/879298946899329,

facebook,"COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS When upon life‚Äôs billows You are tempest tossed, When you are discouraged, Thinking all is lost, Count your many blessings, Name them one by one, And it will surprise you What the Lord hath done. Refrain: Count your blessings, Name them one by one, Count your blessings, See what God hath done! Count your blessings, Name them one by one, And it will surprise you What the Lord hath done. Are you ever burdened With a load of care? Does the cross seem heavy You are called to bear? Count your many blessings, Every doubt will fly, And you will keep singing As the days go by. When you look at others With their lands and gold, Think that Christ has promised You His wealth untold; Count your many blessings. Wealth can never buy Your reward in Heaven, Nor your home on high. So, amid the conflict Whether great or small, Do not be disheartened, God is over all; Count your many blessings, Angels will attend, Help and comfort give you To your journey‚Äôs end.

facebook,"POWER COMMUNION SERVICE ‚Äì WEDNESDAY, 11TH OCTOBER 2023 ANCHOR SCRIPTURE(S): GENESIS 32:24-28 MESSAGE TOPIC: DEMANDS FOR DELIVERANCE By: Dr Paul Enenche SERVICE OBJECTIVE(S): Understanding what must be in place for deliverance to happen Complete deliverance is possible with God when the demands are met (John 8:32, 36) ISSUES IN THE FAMILY OF JACOB: 1. 1st borns were not transmitters of the generational Blessing 2. Everyone had to be barren first before giving birth to children 3. They were successful but there was a lot of contention 4. Situations always arose that made them tell lies (Abraham said Sarah was his sister, same with Isaac, then Jacob lied that he was Esau) WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS FOR DELIVERANCE? 1. Impatience with bondage or oppression (Mark 10:46-48) When you come to the point where you are impatient with bondage and oppression then you are at the beginning of liberty 1a. The patience of the oppressed is the strength of the oppressor When the oppressed is patient, the oppressor is strengthened The patience of the oppressed gives the oppressor permission to function 1b. The tolerance of the oppressed sustains the aggression of the oppressor (Mark 10:46-48) There are people who react against you because they don‚Äôt know what it means to be in your position When your destiny/liberty is at stake, never allow any devil to shut you up! Your decision to be desperate compels the attention of Heaven To be a patient you have to be patient In the realm of the spirit, you must be impatient with the devil if you don‚Äôt want the devil to make you a patient 2. Desperation for answer (Gen. 32:24-28; 1 Sam. 1:11; Mark 5:25-29) Place of prayer search for light 2a. Desperation is key to deliverance 2b. Desperation is key to restoration 2c. Desperate efforts are required for drastic results (1 Sam. 1:11; Mark 5:25-29) 3. Dogged faith in the goodness, faithfulness and Almightiness of God (Heb. 11:6; Luke 10:19, 18, 1 John 4:4; 5:4; Mark 16:17) Dogged faith always makes free 3a. Faith that the goodness of God will overcome the wickedness of the devil in your life 3b. Faith that the faithfulness of God will overcome the viciousness of the devil 3c. Faith that the Almightiness of God is bigger than the powerfulness of the devil 3d. Faith that the Blessing is stronger than the curse Wetin dey work for me pass wetin dey work against me! (What is working for me is greater than what is working against me) Never allow the devil to over-magnify himself to you; charge your faith! WHAT CHARGES YOUR FAITH? i. The study of the Word (Rom. 10:17) ii. The testimonies of the supremacy of God over the devil (Rev. 19:10) 4. The maintenance of a fighting spirit (Gen. 32:24-28; 1 Sam, 17:34-50) 4a. There is no freedom without a fight, no victory without conflict 4b. Whatever will be conquered must be confronted 4c. Change happens with the application of force (Gen. 32:24-28; 1 Sam, 17:34-50) To refuse the fight is to agree to fail You fight with the Word, with praise, with our decrees, and declarations. Persistence wears out resistance; when you refuse to be tired, the oppressor must get tired! Father, I receive the baptism of the Spirit of the fighter, in Jesus‚Äô Name! 5. The refusal to give up (Gen. 32:26; Job 14:14; Luke 13:10-12) 5a. Your persistence is the answer to your resistance 5b. If you won‚Äôt give up, you can‚Äôt go down. 5c. If you won‚Äôt give up, you must go up. PRAYERS Father, in the Name of Jesus, I decree the reversal of every satanic contract or handwriting against my life and destiny, the Church, Dunamis, and the Nation, Nigeria. Today, by the Blood of Jesus, I declare, you are reversed! ‚Äì Col. 2:13-15. In the Name of Jesus, today, I cancel every enemy verdict and pronouncement against my life and destiny, the Church, Dunamis, and the Nation, Nigeria. Oh you verdict of hell, you are cancelled by the Blood of Jesus, in Jesus' Name ‚Äì Isa. 54:17. In the Name of Jesus, today, I decree that every altar of satanic activity targeted for adversity, calamity or distraction for my life and destiny, the Church, Dunamis, and the Nation, Nigeria, oh you altar, I command you, CATCH FIRE NOW ‚Äì Jer. 51:25. Father, in the Name of Jesus, I decree that every altar of divination, witchcraft, and enchantment erected against my life and destiny, the Church, Dunamis, and the Nation, Nigeria, oh you altar, and the witches and wizards behind the altar, CATCH FIRE NOW ‚Äì Num. 23:23. Father, I ask that every enemy trap or snares of destruction set for my life, destiny, family, the Church, Dunamis and Nation, Nigeria be destroyed by the Fire üî• of the Spirit in Jesus Name ‚Äì Psalm 124:1-End. Father, I ask that Your Wall of Fire üî• and Glory in the midst of Your Church, Dunamis will shield Your people from every aggression, confrontation and counterattacks of the enemy in this season Lord in Jesus Name ‚Äì Zech. 2:5. Father, we ask that You will enthrone Your Rule, Reign, Agenda, Plan and Purpose in Nigeria and dethrone the rule, reign, agenda, (truncated)",,594,"{'like_count': 488, 'comment_count': 63, 'num_users': 41082}",Dunamis Rukpokwu,,2023-10-11 22:02:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/298543071_102227102602924_6592210983036688374_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=-ZyXsn68H4wAX-JlXFI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCRDbvtIf6A2KjzE4A2bBcZ5iGKEtVM5TRm-RvqKI-gVw&oe=655ABFC8,https://www.facebook.com/100084207653270/posts/295039426646310,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387213206_295039446646308_368491887257922659_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=-CFyr6vFcokAX931tbJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD_RtfpT0rs_tVxN0FR9mQo9g4x4MhuFIwu4GCyNKMUJw&oe=652CBE55

facebook,"15 lessons from Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ by Daniel Goleman: 1. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. 2. EI is just as important for success in life as IQ, and perhaps even more so. 3. EI consists of five key skills: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. 4. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions. 5. Self-regulation is the ability to manage your emotions and impulses. 6. Motivation is the ability to set and achieve goals. 7. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. 8. Social skills are the ability to build and maintain relationships. 9. EI can be learned and improved over time. 10. EI can help you succeed in all areas of your life, including your personal relationships, your career, and your health. 11. EI can help you make better decisions. When you are aware of your own emotions and the emotions of others, you are better able to weigh all of the factors involved in a decision. 12. EI can help you resolve conflict more effectively. When you can understand and empathize with the other person's perspective, you are more likely to find a solution that works for everyone. 13. EI can help you build stronger relationships. When you are able to communicate your own emotions clearly and understand the emotions of others, you are more likely to build trust and intimacy. 14. EI can help you manage stress and anxiety. When you are able to identify and manage your own emotions, you are better able to cope with stressful situations. 15. EI can lead to better physical health. Studies have shown that people with high EI are less likely to suffer from heart disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. How to improve your emotional intelligence: ‚Ä¢ Pay attention to your emotions. Notice how you feel throughout the day and try to identify the triggers that cause your emotions to change. ‚Ä¢ Label your emotions. Once you can identify your emotions, put a name to them. This will help you to better understand what you are feeling and why. ‚Ä¢ Manage your emotions. Once you understand your emotions, you can develop strategies for managing them in a healthy way. For example, if you are feeling angry, you might try taking a few deep breaths or going for a walk. ‚Ä¢ Empathize with others. Try to put yourself in the shoes of others and see things from their perspective. This will help you to better understand their feelings and motivations. ‚Ä¢ Develop your social skills. Practice communicating effectively, building relationships, and resolving conflict. There are many resources available to help you improve your emotional intelligence.

Strengthening financial stability frameworks can be challenging in low-income or fragile and conflict affected states, where human resources are scarce and initial capacity is low. In such cases, it is essential to prioritize and sequence capacity building over a longer time and provide hands-on expert support. The Financial Sector Stability Review (FSSR) proposes a well-structured approach to designing financial sector reforms based on a thorough diagnostic of capacity gaps. FSSR recipient countries benefit from a well-prioritized package of technical assistance, in many cases supported by resident technical advisors, who work in close partnership with the authorities.

Upon the advent of the First World War and the subsequent invasion of Belgium by German forces, a young Suzanne Fabry was forced to flee to England along with her father, the renowned Symbolist painter √âmile Fabry. Having spent time in Herefordshire and St Ives, the family returned to Brussels at the end of the conflict, where Fabry‚Äôs upbringing continued to be influenced by the political turmoil and ideological upheaval that defined the earlier part of the twentieth century.

Later deciding to become an artist herself, Autoportrait was painted in 1932, in the years following Fabry‚Äôs graduation from the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts. A relatively early work by Fabry, this monumental self-portrait nevertheless depicts an artist who is fully confident in her skills and assured of her own sense of artistic identity. Influenced by her father‚Äôs symbolist tendencies, Fabry was never overshadowed by his legacy. Using her own distinctive style, she went on to create an enigmatic body of work which was dominated by assured yet dream-like portraiture and subtle interrogations of the female form in the post-war environment.

This current work recalls classical depictions of female beauty, whilst also calling them in to question. The slight contortion of Fabry‚Äôs limbs suggests a certain artifice to the pose, whilst her direct gaze and the prominent positioning of her brush reinforce a sense of authority that pre-emptively rejects any attempt to perceive the sitter as a mere aesthetic object. The stripped-back composition further emphasises the sitter‚Äôs commanding presence, whilst also drawing focus to the intricacies of her clothing, this delicate rendering of fabric recalling Fabry‚Äôs later prolific output as costume designer for the Belgian national opera house, La Monnaie. Taking the dual role of artist and muse, Fabry creates a self-portrait that examines the viewer as much as they examine the work itself, and it is through such confrontations that Fabry‚Äôs inimitable skill as a portraitist truly shines.

* * *

Born in Brussels in 1904, Suzanne Fabry was the daughter of the Belgian symbolist painter √âmile Fabry (1865‚Äì1966) and his wife Virginie Duch√™nes. Her brother, Barth√©l√©my, was born in 1898. Three years before Suzanne‚Äôs birth, her father was named Professor of Drawing at the l‚ÄôAcad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles, where he had been a student in the 1880s, and her childhood was spent in his house-studio at rue Verte (today rue du Coll√®ge Saint-Michel, n¬∞6) in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, a south-eastern neighbourhood of Brussels of recent urbanisation. 

At the start of the First World War, √âmile Fabry moved with his family to England, first staying in Herefordshire and later in the Cornish town of Saint-Ives, where he would continue to paint, and they would remain until the end of the conflict. Back in Brussels, the family returned to their home on rue Verte, and in 1923 Suzanne enrolled as a student at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts, where her teachers included Jean Delville (1867-1953) and Constant Montald (1862-1944), two of the founders, alongside Suzanne‚Äôs father, of the group ‚ÄúL'art monumental‚Äù. Their aim was to produce art for the public sphere, monumental in scale and steeped within the cultural tradition of the period, intended to elevate the public conscience by means of representing idealised, universal themes. Their commanding nudes would constitute an important source of inspiration for Suzanne‚Äôs own work. 

Having graduated from the Acad√©mie in 1928, Suzanne began her career as a painter in the 1930s, taking part in the triennial Salon in Antwerp (1930) and the quadrennial Salon in Li√®ge (1931). Around the same time, her father was completing a cycle of large-scale paintings for the entrance and staircase of Brussels‚Äô opera house, La Monnaie, where, many years later, Suzanne and her husband Edmond Delescluze (1905-1993) would be employed as costume and set designer respectively, a collaboration that began in 1948 and is recorded in over 900 sketches and stage maquettes preserved today in the archives of La Monnaie. She continued to pursue her career as a painter, alongside her work as head of the opera‚Äôs costume workshop, until her death in 1985.

facebook,"15 lessons from Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ by Daniel Goleman: 1. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. 2. EI is just as important for success in life as IQ, and perhaps even more so. 3. EI consists of five key skills: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. 4. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions. 5. Self-regulation is the ability to manage your emotions and impulses. 6. Motivation is the ability to set and achieve goals. 7. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. 8. Social skills are the ability to build and maintain relationships. 9. EI can be learned and improved over time. 10. EI can help you succeed in all areas of your life, including your personal relationships, your career, and your health. 11. EI can help you make better decisions. When you are aware of your own emotions and the emotions of others, you are better able to weigh all of the factors involved in a decision. 12. EI can help you resolve conflict more effectively. When you can understand and empathize with the other person's perspective, you are more likely to find a solution that works for everyone. 13. EI can help you build stronger relationships. When you are able to communicate your own emotions clearly and understand the emotions of others, you are more likely to build trust and intimacy. 14. EI can help you manage stress and anxiety. When you are able to identify and manage your own emotions, you are better able to cope with stressful situations. 15. EI can lead to better physical health. Studies have shown that people with high EI are less likely to suffer from heart disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. How to improve your emotional intelligence: ‚Ä¢ Pay attention to your emotions. Notice how you feel throughout the day and try to identify the triggers that cause your emotions to change. ‚Ä¢ Label your emotions. Once you can identify your emotions, put a name to them. This will help you to better understand what you are feeling and why. ‚Ä¢ Manage your emotions. Once you understand your emotions, you can develop strategies for managing them in a healthy way. For example, if you are feeling angry, you might try taking a few deep breaths or going for a walk. ‚Ä¢ Empathize with others. Try to put yourself in the shoes of others and see things from their perspective. This will help you to better understand their feelings and motivations. ‚Ä¢ Develop your social skills. Practice communicating effectively, building relationships, and resolving conflict. There are many resources available to help you improve your emotional intelligence. You can find books, articles, and even online courses on the topic. You can also work with a therapist or coach to develop your EI skills.

facebook,"PALESTINE üáµüá∏(summary) -Ang Palestine ay lugar ng mga Propeta. -Walang karapatan ang mga hudyo sa Palestine -Puno‚Äôt dulo ng pangyayari -Ang Palestine ay para sa mga Palestino -Ang Jerusalem ay kapitolyo ng Palestine -Walang bansang Israel Ilan sa mga Propeta na nanirahan dito ay si: Ibrahim(Abraham) Lut(Lot) Ismael(Ismail) Ishaaq(Isaac) Ya‚Äôqoob(Jacob) Yusof (Joseph) Daud(David) Sulaiman(Solomon) Zakariyyah(Zacarias) Yahya(John) {May the peace and blessing be upon them} Si Ibrahim ang anak nya ay dalawa: 1.Si Ismael 2.Si Isaac Ang anak ni Isaac ay si Jacob(Ya‚Äôqoob) kung saan ang karamihan sa mga Propeta ay nagmula sa kanyang angkan tulad ni Yusof(Joseph),Daud(David),Sulaiman(Solomon),Zakariyyah(Zacarias),Musa(Moses)Yahya(John). Ang pangalawang pangalan ni Propeta ishaq(Isaac) ay ISRAEL kaya tinatawag ang kanyang mga angkan na BANU ISRAEL(Son‚Äôs of Israel). Ngunit nakilala na ang angkan ni Israel sa pagsuway at katigasan ng ulo kung saan sila ang kumakalaban at pumapatay sa mismong mga Propeta na ipinadala sakanila maliban sa kakaunting bilang na mga nanamapalataya sakanila kasama ang mga Propeta,ganito ang pagdescribe ng Quran sakanila. Kabilang sa kanilang pagsuway ay: -Sinuway nila si Propeta Solaiman(Solomon) -Sinuway nila si Propeta Musa(Moses) -Sinuway nila si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) -Sila ang pumatay kay Propeta Yahya(John) -Sila ang pumatay kay Propeta Zacariah(Zacarias). KAYA PINARUSAHAN SILA NG ALLAH KUNG SAAN ANG NAGING PARUSA NILA AY WALA SILANG LUPA SA MUNDONG ITO MALIBAN SA MGA NANANAMPALATAYA SAKANILA. Ang nangyari sakanila sa loob ng ilang siglo ay kung saan-saan sila napadpad sa middles east pagkatapos ng panahon ni Propeta Eisa(Jesus),ang iba ay napunta sa Europe at America. Sa World War II sa pagitan ng taon 1941 at 1945 ay nangyari ang Holocaust kung saan namatay ang halos 6 millions na hudyo sa Europa sa kamay ni Adolf Hitler ng Germany. Ang dahilan ng malaking galit na ito ni Adolf Hitler sa mga hudyo ay tungkol sa political at religion kung saan ang paniniwala ng mga hudyo sa mga taong hindi kabilang sakanila ay mga hayop o pinakamababang nilalang,dahil nga naniniwala sila na sila nga ang chosen people na pinili ng Allah,kaya ginawa ito sakanila ni Hitler. Nagkaroon lang naman sila ng lupa sa Palestine dahil naawa ang GREAT BRITAIN sakanila kung saan nirekomenda ito sa UNITED NATIONS at agad naman ito natanggap ng UN sa taong 1947,sapagat matagal din nanilbihan ang mga hudyo sa Great Britain. Sa sumunod na taon(1948) ay nagdeklara kaagad ang mga Zionist Jews ng kanilang sariling bansa sa Palestine na tinawag nilang ISRAEL kung saan parang kailan lng yung pagdating nila sa Palestine bilang mga refugees hanggang sa paunti-unti na nilang pinapalawak ang kanilang lupain sa pagsakop sa mga lupain ng mga palestino sa dahas at sapilitan na paraan,kasabay nun ay inipon nila ang lahat ng mga hudyo sa buong mundo kung saan dati-rati ay magkakawatakwatak dahil sa parusa sakanila ng Allah. Dito na nanghimasok ang mga bansang Arabo at nagkaron ng digmaan na di matapos tapos hanggang ngayon sa pagitan ng mga JEWS at ARABS. Bukod sa conflict na ito ay di rin ginagalang ng mga jews ang mga arabo dahil naniniwala silang mga alipin lng sila kaya hindi sila naniwala kay Propeta Muhammad SAW at madali lng sakanila pumaslang ng arabong Muslim. Bakit? Si Propeta Ismael na kapatid ni Propeta Isaac ay anak ni Hajar na pangalawang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim na dating kasambahay ni Sarah na nanay naman ni Propeta Isaac na unang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim(ayun sa kanilang kasaysayan). At pagkatapos ng paghahari ng mga angkan ni Isaac kung saan ang pinaka huling Propeta sakanila ay si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) ay binigay naman ng Allah ang pangako na ito sa angkan ni Propeta Ismael kung saan magmumula sa kanyang angkan ang huling propeta at Sugo na si Propeta Muhammad SAW. Dahil nga hindi nanggaling sa angkan ni Isaac ang huling Propeta ay hindi naniwala ang mga hudyo,sa paniniwalang mababa lng si Propeta Ismael kumpara sakanilang ninuno na si Propeta Isaac na anak mula sa unang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim,bukod doon ay talagang palasuway sila sa mga Propeta kahit noon pa. Sa madaling salita,ang nangyayaring conflict sa pagitan ng Jews at Arab Muslims ay sa religion at history. Ang Palestine ay lugar ng mga arabong Muslim,at mga nanampalataya sa mga angkan ni Israel,hindi rito kabilang ang mga sumuway,di sila kabilang sa pangako ng Allah. Tatlo ang umiiral na relihiyon sa Palestine: 1.Judaism 2.Christianity 3.Islam BAKIT HINDI KABILANG ANG MGA CHRISTIANS SA PALESTINE SA KAAWAY NG MGA PALESTINONG MUSLIM? Ang mga kristiyano ay hindi tulad ng mga hudyo,kung saan mas malala ang hudyo ngunit iisang lahi lng sila,tinuturing din ng mga hudyo na kaaway ang mga kristiyano dahil hindi naman talaga sila naniwala kay Propeta Eisa(Jesus), sila ang nagparatang kay Maria na nakagawa raw ng pangangalunya(Zinah) at si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) ay anak sa zinah kaya nangyari ang malaking himala mula sa Allah kung saan nagsalita si Propeta (truncated)",,531,"{'like_count': 115, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 18606}",Qur'an and Hadith,,2023-10-11 04:09:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/303636828_175693984974722_2876745023791902041_n.jpg?stp=c8.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QPax6GV-ywQAX9GbOlp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBu0E5T57FQ9xcuAMye57HR440hefuR_D-xCZXtSUwx3A&oe=655A9D34,https://www.facebook.com/100076023657197/posts/332427642634688,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387801615_332427622634690_4299516297231817618_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=gES7D9HxNeIAX8NgPMN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBL1ps6lL-KWvwOIZG-TDazBIJXe_VEXdQObtHcBBC4ww&oe=654EBEA0

facebook,"Why is my alienated child not responding to my messages? A question I am often asked. No response to communications does not mean they don't want to reply or don't love you. Often the communications are highly monitored. Children are not armed with the tools to handle these very challenging situations. Some other reasons why they may not respond: Alienated children may fear the consequences or pressure from the alienating parent, who may actively discourage or even forbid communication with the alienated parent. This fear can be a significant barrier to responding to communication attempts. They may feel a strong sense of loyalty to the alienating parent and may perceive that responding to the alienated parent could be seen as disloyal. They may fear upsetting the favoured parent or experiencing negative consequences. In some cases, the alienating parent may manipulate or emotionally coerce the child into not responding to the other parent's attempts at communication. This manipulation can take the form of guilt, threats or emotional manipulation. Children in these situations often experience high levels of emotional distress and confusion. They may not respond due to their own emotional turmoil or feelings of being caught in the middle of a difficult situation. If the alienated child has been exposed to ongoing conflict and bitterness, they may have difficulty trusting the alienated parent's intentions or believing that communication will be positive or non-confrontational. Remember to self-care every day in every way possible. It is essential to incorporate self-care into your daily routines.

facebook,"Amid the horrific Gaza-Israel conflict, hundreds of animals are suffering unimaginable pain. As the human death toll exceeds 1,500, we can't help but tremble at the idea of the countless animal lives lost and the unknown number of survivors now left wounded, hungry, frightened, and trying to endure the chaos of war. With no end in sight, we are taking immediate action. Our goal right now is to channel funds to our partners on the ground in areas with the most desperate need. In Israel, our partner, Let the Animals Live (LTAL), has moved 32 sick cats and dogs from their bomb-damaged clinic in Ashkelon to their Kfar Ruth shelter, which already houses 250 animals. Our team is delivering emergency food near conflict zones since access is limited. In Gaza, Sulala Animal Rescue cares for 400 dogs and 130 cats, many of which are disabled animals and stray pets. They urgently need food, medicine, and funds to reinforce fencing materials as dogs try to escape due to fear of bomb blasts and airstrikes. Let's keep the animals out of the war. With your support, we will ensure that the tragic animal victims of the Gaza-Israel conflict receive the critical food and medical supplies they need.

facebook,"The notion of high-functioning anxiety comes from this conflict between the intense internal feelings and the ability to function despite those feelings. On the outside: A radiant smile, a meticulously organized desk, every task handled with precision. People might see a go-getter, a person who's got it all together. But beneath the surface: A mind racing at a million miles an hour, constant self-doubt, a fear of not being good enough, and sleepless nights worrying about the smallest details. High-functioning anxiety isn't always visible to the casual observer, but it‚Äôs a silent battle many face daily.

Illustrated"" published by Western Historical Company, 1878, over a green forested area. Red Eagle or William Weatherford (1780 or 1781 - March 24, 1824) was a Creek chief. One of many mixed-race descendants of Southeast Indians who intermarried with European traders and later colonial settlers. Red Eagle was of mixed Creek, French and Scots ancestry. He was raised as a Creek in the matrilineal nation and achieved his power in it, through his mother's prominent Wind Clan, as well as his father's trading connections. After showing his skill as a warrior, he was given the war name of Hopnicafutsahia. The Creek War (1813-1814), also known as the Red Stick War and the Creek Civil War, was a regional war between opposing Creek factions, European empires, and the United States, taking place largely in Alabama and along the Gulf Coast. Red Eagle became increasingly concerned about the influx of European Americans onto Creek land and eventually led a group known as ‚ÄúRed Sticks,‚Äù bent on protecting their land, their way of life, and their people from intruders. Eventually the smaller forces of Red Sticks and the larger opposing forces led by General Andrew Jackson came against each other. The conflict ended in the decisive defeat of the Red Sticks at The Battle of Horseshoe Bend, near modern-day Dadeville, Alabama. Terms were drawn up that provided far less land than the Creek tribe had previously held. The quote attributed to Chief Red Eagle reads, ""Angry people want you to see how powerful they are. Loving people want you to see how powerful YOU are.""-End ID]",,459,"{'like_count': 252, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 224975}",Native American Culture Pride,,2023-10-11 08:00:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/313428973_3376621869328425_3415242828591883691_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GqhjPHi4GboAX--g6TU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBO7t3iPoImjFS58ir8ipNdxtWwBmFXFzUxW1OBx-VGlw&oe=655A47B6,https://www.facebook.com/100087079704001/posts/282576887988299,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387056684_282002071379114_1541968933712781724_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rvBdp7k-MvMAX_Ub3H8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAjBQd-d8UTrXmAQo5ljmvouQlUqPgdycLML4hjVUWT6A&oe=652C1400

‚úùÔ∏èIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

‚úùÔ∏èSay the Apostles Creed: I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son, Our Lord; Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

‚úùÔ∏èOne Our Father, three Hail Marys, one Glory Be to the Father.

‚úùÔ∏èThe First Glorious Mystery - The Resurrection of Jesus. If the Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from death, lives in you, then he who raised Christ from death will also give life to your mortal bodies by the presence of his Spirit in you. (Romans 8:11).

On Sunday morning the women came to the tomb to embalm the body of our Lord. While on the way, they looked and were astonished that the stone had been rolled away. It seemed that Jesus Christ had lost the battle. But the fact is that He won! Jesus conquered the darkest realities of sin and death by the power of His resurrection. 

The Glory Realized. Jesus, your victory over sin and death is real. Yet this world seems so caught up in tragedies which give the illusion that darkness is winning. Increase our faith so that we can know that the victory is ours. Through the Eucharist, Your Word, and the Church, help us to grow in Your love.

‚úùÔ∏èThe Second Glorious Mystery - The Ascension of Jesus. As he was blessing them, he departed from them and was taken up into heaven. (Luke 24:51). Jesus ascended to the right hand of the Father. He promised us that we would not be alone and that He would be with us all days, even to the end of time. Jesus goes to the Father to intercede for us and to prepare a place for us.

We Can Do All Things. Jesus, You promised that Your power would work in us if we believe. ""You will do greater things than these because I go to the Father."" It is precisely because You are at the right hand of the Father that we experience Your presence and power in our lives.

‚úùÔ∏èThe Third Glorious Mystery - The Gift of the Holy Spirit. When the day of Pentecost came, all the believers were gathered together in one place. Suddenly there was a noise from the sky that sounded like a strong wind blowing, and it filled the whole house. (Acts 2:1-2).

The disciples were gathered together in prayer and the Blessed Mother was in their midst. All of a sudden the Holy Spirit came in the form of fire upon all those gathered in prayer. People from different countries and backgrounds were all united by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Inner Strength. Lord Jesus, You were able to transform Peter. The one who denied you could now stand tall. Send forth Your Holy Spirit upon the Church so that we, too, may be restored and renewed. Let Your Spirit fill our hearts with praise and adoration. Make us bold in proclaiming the trust of our faith in You.

‚úùÔ∏èThe Fourth Glorious Mystery - The Assumption of Mary. She was given the two wings of a large eagle, in order to fly to her place in the desert, where she will be taken care of . . . safe from the dragon's attack. (Revelation 12:14). 

Being raised to heaven, body and soul. Mary is at the right hand of Jesus. Jesus is at the right hand of the Father. Mary is in an unique place to intercede for us. She is in union with the Blessed Trinity by the grace of God.

Future Dignity. Mary, the gift that you received was a gift for the Church. It brings us hope and comfort to know that God is providing for our eternal life. Mary, help us not to focus on passing pleasures, but rather to set our hearts on the will of the Father!

facebook,"#TheKnowledgeofGitaisNectar || Part - 21 Resolution of Doubt || Part-M In Gita Chapter 12 Verse 5, it is said that - ""Those whose faith is in the Sachidanand Ghan Brahm (True-happiness-giving God), that is, in Param Akshar Brahm, and who only (chetsa) know Him, majority of the time (kleshH) because of doubt they are in a conflict of knowledge. Due to this, it is a salvation attained through suffering by those human beings."" The meaning is that because of not finding a Tatvadarshi Saint (Complete Satguru), even Kabir Panthis (Gheesa Das Panthi, Garibdas Panthi, Dadu Panthi, Nekiram Panthi, all these are called Kabir Panthis) practice difficult religious austerity. They perform fasting, vow of silence and other difficult religious practices. Therefore, it is said that the way of worship of that Complete God is attained through hardships and miseries. But in reality, all the scripture-based way of worship is very easy. Evidence: - In Yajurved Chapter 40 Mantra 15, it is said about worship of Brahm that: - VaayuH anilam amritam ath idam bhasmantam shareeram | Om kritam smar, kilbey smar, kartuH smar || Meaning: - 'Om' naam is of Bramh worship. To get the amritam, that is, salvation obtained from it, chant 'Om' naam (vayuH anilam) through incoming and outgoing breath with full devotion until the end of the body (kritam smar) remember it while doing work, (kilbey smar) remember it with an ache, that is, with a pang in the heart, (KartuH smar) remember it considering it to be the main task of human life. (Yajurved Chapter 40 Mantra 15) Then Yajurved Chapter 40 Mantra 17, the speaker of the knowledge of Vedas (he is also the speaker of Gita) has stated that - 'That Complete God is hidden (unmanifested) in the upper lok (world). (Aham kham Brahm Om) I am Brahm; I live in divine sky-like Brahm Lok; my mantra is 'Om'. In Yajurved Chapter 40 Mantra 10, the speaker of the knowledge of Vedas says that - ""Some consider God (Sambhavaat) to be in form who takes birth as an incarnation; some (asambhavaat) consider Him to be unborn, that is, formless. Whether that God takes birth or not or whatever He is like, (Dheeranam) Tatvadarshi Saints give that knowledge; (ShrunuH) listen from them. (Yajurved Chapter 40 Mantra 10) This same evidence is given in Gita Chapter 4 Verse 34 that the Tatvdarshi Saints impart the complete knowledge about God. Search for them; by asking them question without any deceit, politely and by prostrating before them, those Tatvdarshi saints will impart true spiritual knowledge to you. It is also mentioned in Sukshm Ved that: - Naam uthat naam baithat, naam sovat jaag re | Naam khaate naam peete, naam seti lag re || Meaning: - The worship of God is done only by chanting naam (mantra). Chant that naam (mantra) while doing your work, before falling asleep, as soon as you wake up in the morning, while having food, while drinking any liquid, that is, remember naam while doing all the tasks. The purport is that instead of doing Hathyog, perform worship in Karmyog. ""There are two types of Knowledge in Gita"" The knowledge of Gita that does not match with the Vedas (Rigved, Yajurved, Samved and Atharvaved) and the Sukshm Ved (the true spiritual knowledge which Sachidanand Ghan Brahm i.e. Satya Purush has uttered from his lotus-mouth) is incorrect. It is the personal opinion of the Speaker of the knowledge of Gita; it is not acceptable. The Speaker of Gita has stated in many verses (Gita Chapter 13 Verse 2, Chapter 7 Verse 18, Chapter 6 Verse 36, Chapter 3 Verse 31 and Chapter 18 Verse 70) that this is my opinion, my thought. In Shrimadbhagavat Gita, 95 percent of the knowledge is that of the Vedas and 5 percent is the personal opinion of the speaker of Gita. If it matches with the Vedas, then it is okay; otherwise, it is useless. Gita Chapter 2 Verses 37-38 are sufficient as examples. There is conflicting information in these. In Gita Chapter 2 Verse 37, he is telling benefit and loss. He has said that - 'Either by dying in the battle you will go to heaven, or by winning the battle you will rule the earth. Therefore, O Arjun! Stand up for the battle.' (Gita Chapter 2 Verse 37) Then immediately in Gita Chapter 2 Verse 38, he says contradictory to this that - 'Considering victory and defeat, joy and sorrow to be equal, get ready for the battle. By fighting in this way, you will not incur sin.' (Gita Chapter 2 Verse 38) Even in Gita Chapter 11 Verse 33, he has clarified that - ""You may get up; achieve fame. By winning over the enemies, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. I have already killed the warriors in front of you; you may only be the cause.' ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ For getting spiritual information, do listen to the auspicious spiritual discourses of Saint Rampal Ji Maharaj on Sant Rampal Ji Maharaj YOUTUBE channel from 7:30-8:30 pm daily.

facebook,"A Stark Prediction: The Consequences of Falling for Media and Government Narratives In recent years, the world has been on a precipice, teetering between unity and division. The divisive narratives spun by media outlets and governments have only deepened the chasm. The Covid-19 pandemic was just the beginning, a precursor to the potential chaos that could ensue if we continue to be swayed by these narratives. If we allow ourselves to be continuously divided by the stories we are fed, the future looks bleak: 1. Deeper Erosion of Trust: As people become more polarized, trust in neighbors, friends, and even family will erode. Communities that once thrived on mutual respect and understanding will become hotbeds of suspicion and animosity. 2. Loss of Personal Freedoms: Governments, under the guise of ""safety"" and ""security,"" will introduce more restrictive legislation. The rights and freedoms we hold dear could be curtailed, all in the name of a perceived greater good. 3. Economic Instability: A divided populace is easier to control, but it's also less productive and innovative. Economic downturns, job losses, and financial crises could become the norm rather than the exception. 4. Global Conflicts: The war between Israel and Palestine might be just the tip of the iceberg. As countries take sides and alliances shift, the world could be dragged into a devastating global conflict, the likes of which we've never seen. 5. Social Unrest: Protests, riots, and civil unrest could become commonplace. Streets that once echoed with laughter and joy might reverberate with the sounds of anger and despair. 6. Mental Health Crisis: The constant barrage of negative news, coupled with the loss of social connections, could lead to a significant rise in mental health issues. Depression, anxiety, and other disorders might become rampant. This is not a future any of us want. But it's a future that could very well become a reality if we continue to let divisive narratives dictate our beliefs and actions. It's a call to action for every individual: question everything, seek the truth, and prioritize unity and understanding above all else. The fate of our world hinges on our ability to see through the smoke and mirrors and come together as one.

Sending so much love out to all those affected across the globe that need our deep love and compassion, we are such testing times! I love you deep in my heart <3 Jo xx Today, we reach the peak of this year of wisdom integration. We are concluding a cycle on both a personal and a planetary level, that is represented today by two important events, Pluto moving direct again, for those who resonate with slow-motion phases, which is reflecting the profound rebirth and transformation that is happening, at this time. Secondly, the 10:10 portal, which in numerology may symbolize the end and beginning of a new cycle or other meanings that it may have for you. However, at this time, Guides invite us to focus upon this number beyond the earthly meaning it has for us. There is a lot behind the many planetary events that are happening at this time, and that are associated with this number. The 10/10 portal this year is bringing to the surface the many conflicts and the many distortions that are yet to be healed, in both the micro and the macro structure of our planet. Guides have been showing me this for a week now, especially as I kept seeing on FB the so-called Tree of Life, which I personally call our 12th-dimensional angelic template, with ten orbs rather than 12th, as we are twelfth-dimensional beings, as you all know. This has come followed by a message of the big correction that is taking place at this time of the many planetary reversals that are yet associated with this number and that again are created to modify our original 12th dimensional DNA structure, as well as the planetary grid one, by reducing it to number ten. This is one of the most common tactics to diminish our power and manipulate our DNA, among many other purposes that even today go unnoticed by many in the spiritual community. Being well informed and listening to our guidance is pivotal to removing the many non-benevolent techniques destined to manipulate us. Please, take what resonates and leave the rest. Be aware of the importance of using the authentic template to work with our bodies and DNA. This is a very powerful month, especially for planetary workers to continue dismantling the inorganic planetary grid system and anchoring the authentic crystalline one. The many events that are taking place at this time reflect the profound polarization and control that still reign in many countries and how much we need to continue being centered in our hearts to assist in the way we best can. The more we ascend, the more separation we can witness, not because the planet is not evolving, but because the more we raise our frequency the more we can envision the lower planes, becoming more aware of all we are leaving behind and of all the assistance that many still need during this planetary transition. As I previously shared, this month is one of constant integration and anchoring for gridworkers whose main mission is to act as New Earth's Anchors. Stabilization is pivotal now in some countries where the anchoring of the fifth-dimensional crystalline grid is not yet possible. Guides invite us to use the Aurora shield or the central sun-plasmic one, as it best resonates with your guidance and purpose, to protect and stabilize the regions that are now in profound transition, and misalignment with Unity Consciousness, as it will protect those who are on a mission on these complicated regions, and that too need of our love and support. These are universal techniques that everyone can use for we all can send love and restoration, independently of our specific mission. Remember not to fall into extremes at this time of conflict, for this is too part of a big manipulation to make you judge, and hence separate. Unity is precisely about embracing All within Divine Love to dissolve, to bring higher understanding, and above all, compassion to what we cannot change. As we approach the eclipse we will feel the fierceness of the energies that are already among us. Nurture yourselves before stepping into gridwork or any other personal purpose you have at this time, for the body suffers from the many energies colliding at the same time in our bodies and we need constant cleansing to help the body release faster, so it can embody the new energies. Sometimes it is best to stop for a while and recover rather than force ourselves to go beyond what we can do, at this time, for this will not be of assistance to you or anyone else. Remember to scan your bodies on a daily basis, correct what needs to, and respect your sacred template, Beloved Ones. Have a blessed passage!

facebook,"üî¥ Reactions poured in from across the globe following #Hamas's surprise attack on #Israel on October 7. As of now, more than 2,200 lives have been lost as result of this conflict. At least 1,200 Israelis had been killed in the attack, while 1,055 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the strike. Israel has been bombarding the Gaza Strip since the weekend, in retaliation to Hamas's attack. We rounded up the initial reactions of world leaders to the ongoing conflict here.

facebook,"14-year-old Klondike entered Riverside Shelter in May as a severely matted and flea-infested stray. After he was euth-listed, we put a hold on him and began arranging for his exit. We put out a plea for volunteers to do his freedom ride, which Jayne Kleinfeld saw while she was sitting on the Frosted Faces Foundation‚Äôs porch while waiting for her Frosted Face Beck and Charlie‚Äôs vet appointments. She offered to go get him and brought him down to us safely. Jayne found that she couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about Klondike and came back to scoop him up for a Fling that same week! After their two-week Fling was up and she brought him back to Frosted Faces Foundation, she was completely devastated and cried every day! She missed him so much and ultimately realized that she couldn‚Äôt imagine not being his family. Jayne made it official and adopted Klondike! Here is an update on how he is doing: ‚ÄúKlondike has settled in fantastically! I initially took him on a Fling before I adopted him, and within a few hours of being here, he had become my shadow and was following me everywhere. He's super low maintenance and has been a joy to have around. He always gets rave remarks on how sweet and calm he is when he visits the Frosted Faces vet staff for appointments! It was a little bit of an adjustment for my non-Frosted Face Farrah to get used to him at first. To be clear, this was a one-sided feud that Farrah instigated - Klondike did absolutely nothing wrong! I think Farrah was just intimidated by him because he's a little bit bigger than her and she felt that her alpha status was being threatened. It's now been a few months, and while they're not besties, they coexist just fine with little conflict! His favorite food is everything, and his favorite activity is napping! He's pretty low-energy and just enjoys sleeping for most of the day, which means that he fits in perfectly with my Frosted Face's Beck and Charlie (formerly Domingo)! He wasn't feeling too good at the beginning of last month, so I took him to see Dr. Russell, who discovered that he had a foreign body that was causing an intestinal blockage. He had surgery at Anicira the next morning, where they ended up removing a small rock from his stomach. His recovery was rough. He wouldn't eat for about a week after the surgery, and I had to bring him back to the vet multiple times to try and get his appetite back. Then, his incision site got infected badly, and he had to go back to Anicira to be put under anesthesia for a second time so that they could open the site back up and clean out the area. He was such a trooper! Thankfully, his incision site healed well the second time and he is back to his normal self! When someone mentions they would like to adopt, I ALWAYS mention how amazing Frosted Faces is and how rewarding it is to give a senior pet a home. There's a reason why so many Frosted Faces families are loyal adopters who have adopted multiple Frosted Faces! This rescue is just the best, and I'm so thankful to be able to be a part of it!‚Äù Family: Jayne Kleinfeld Fans: Kelly Nielsen and The Mendoza Family Facts: Klondike is 14 years old and was rescued from Riverside Shelter on May 15, 2023.",,400,"{'like_count': 124, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 74075}",Frosted Faces Foundation,,2023-10-11 12:01:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/155804173_281495059998420_279890530389623903_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=tFp4pLuyHmkAX9N7d-e&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBL6uAzHHdZz5BgI5C92XkLQPfoQyvLHsbB0Zo67AD3Yw&oe=657D3795,https://www.facebook.com/100044137854317/posts/961826418631944,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387841917_961460792001840_6732474606195715902_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=sigQdWhe-twAX9tCt3W&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDREXILm-DvOfeW4uKVqaBPaQP1uUrzRNJJfPoXSIGyKw&oe=652C341A

facebook,"15 lessons from Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ by Daniel Goleman: 1. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. 2. EI is just as important for success in life as IQ, and perhaps even more so. 3. EI consists of five key skills: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. 4. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions. 5. Self-regulation is the ability to manage your emotions and impulses. 6. Motivation is the ability to set and achieve goals. 7. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. 8. Social skills are the ability to build and maintain relationships. 9. EI can be learned and improved over time. 10. EI can help you succeed in all areas of your life, including your personal relationships, your career, and your health. 11. EI can help you make better decisions. When you are aware of your own emotions and the emotions of others, you are better able to weigh all of the factors involved in a decision. 12. EI can help you resolve conflict more effectively. When you can understand and empathize with the other person's perspective, you are more likely to find a solution that works for everyone. 13. EI can help you build stronger relationships. When you are able to communicate your own emotions clearly and understand the emotions of others, you are more likely to build trust and intimacy. 14. EI can help you manage stress and anxiety. When you are able to identify and manage your own emotions, you are better able to cope with stressful situations. 15. EI can lead to better physical health. Studies have shown that people with high EI are less likely to suffer from heart disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. How to improve your emotional intelligence: ‚Ä¢ Pay attention to your emotions. Notice how you feel throughout the day and try to identify the triggers that cause your emotions to change. ‚Ä¢ Label your emotions. Once you can identify your emotions, put a name to them. This will help you to better understand what you are feeling and why. ‚Ä¢ Manage your emotions. Once you understand your emotions, you can develop strategies for managing them in a healthy way. For example, if you are feeling angry, you might try taking a few deep breaths or going for a walk. ‚Ä¢ Empathize with others. Try to put yourself in the shoes of others and see things from their perspective. This will help you to better understand their feelings and motivations. ‚Ä¢ Develop your social skills. Practice communicating effectively, building relationships, and resolving conflict. There are many resources available to help you improve your emotional intelligence. You can find books, articles, and even online courses on the topic. You can also work with a therapist or coach to develop your EI skills.

The leader of the opposition Sajith Premadasa said that decisions regarding the environment sector should be made scientifically, where data on flora and fauna and human resources is extremely important and the recent improvements of interest in the environment sector is a positive sign. Hon. Premadasa pointed out that human and physical resources of the wildlife department dealing with wildlife should be developed and, however, a group of volunteers have been working in this department for over 10 years. He also pointed out that getting their services through a formal permanent recruitment process will be a positive impetus for conflict control between wildlife and the community. The opposition leader pointed out that even the wildlife department should be an entrepreneur based on forest resources and the camping grounds belonging to the department can be opened to tourists through which the department can generate revenue. The leader of the opposition Sajith Premadasa emphasized that formal training should be given to the wildlife officers in connection with the wildlife induction zones by (truncated)",,396,"{'like_count': 266, 'comment_count': 51, 'num_users': 845269}",Sajith Premadasa,,2023-10-11 06:05:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/253156810_430692581750313_1056987793374155615_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=719XrkQE2iAAX9EUurx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB7A4r_SqpozSFwXAiw8ob2wO5KNudUUU3mMNtAu2pGwg&oe=655A5DE0,https://www.facebook.com/100044287246641/posts/883297669823133,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387830874_883297503156483_2928034029168273518_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=e5n3BHS2cucAX_y2ZN-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCdFQIHkygcZ2-DYfQoG2naBP3hsVVvQRs882nLIqtCbQ&oe=652B586B

facebook,"We always read parashat Bereshit on the Sabbath following the holiday of Simchat Torah, and therefore it begins the Torah reading sequence for the new Jewish year.... Right at the outset of the narrative of the Torah, then, we will read about the ‚Äúproto-euangelion,‚Äù or the ‚Äúfirst gospel‚Äù message of God‚Äôs redemption given through the Promised Seed of Eve... ==== The very first prophecy of the Torah concerns the promise of the coming ‚ÄúSeed of the woman‚Äù who would vanquish the serpent (nachash) that had originally tempted and deceived Eve (Gen. 3:15). This prophecy is sometimes called the proto-euangelion (‚Äúfirst gospel‚Äù), since it is the starting point of all subsequent prophecy and redemptive history revealed in the Scriptures. Indeed, since the mystery of the Incarnation of God the Son (the ‚ÄúSon of Man‚Äù) is foreshadowed here, this prophecy is linked to the original woman, Eve. Just as Eve became a carrier of the corruption of human nature by heeding the voice of the tempter, so she would be the carrier of God Himself for the deliverance of mankind through the advent of the Redeemer. In the tragic aftermath of the transgression of the first man and woman, then, God first announced His unfailing redemptive love for the human race that would culminate in the birth, sacrifice, and resurrection of Yeshua our Savior and Deliverer - ‚Äúborn of a woman, born under the law‚Äù (Gal. 4:4). Our restoration begins with God‚Äôs love and passion. God's first question to Adam after he broke covenant was: ""Where (◊ê÷∑◊ô÷º÷∂◊õ÷º÷∏◊î) are you?"" - the voice of a loving Father in search of his son (Gen. 3:9). Of course God knew exactly how his son was attempting to hide, though He almost acted as if He was unwilling to believe that he would betray his love by disobeying His commandment. Therefore God‚Äôs poignant question was directed to Adam‚Äôs heart: ‚ÄúOh my son, how did you get to this place?‚Äù God was giving Adam an opportunity to turn back to Him, to confess the sin, to undergo teshuvah, to become reconciled... This is the necessary prelude to any honest relationship with God. Recall that the original promise of the coming Savior was given within the context of the curse and judgment upon Satan: ""I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall crush your head, and you shall crush his heel"" (Gen. 3:15). That God‚Äôs promise was first directed to Satan is surely by design, since he ‚Äúleft his first estate‚Äù by becoming the ‚Äúmonster in the garden‚Äù and was therefore primarily responsible for the transgression of Adam and Eve in the first place (Ezek. 28:13-15,19). The promise delivered to Satan was therefore one of coming retribution and divine judgment: Evil would not have the last word in the matter of mankind, and therefore Satan‚Äôs schemes would be avenged by God in the fullness of time (Gal. 4:4-5). Notice, however, that Adam and Eve were not yet judged for their sin when the LORD God gave the promise of the coming of the Redeemer. Before a word of judgment was directed toward them, God‚Äôs love and light was already revealed. Indeed, immediately after their judgment was pronounced, ‚Äúthe LORD God made tunics of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them‚Äù (Gen. 3:21) - a clear picture of being compassionately ‚Äúrobed in righteousness‚Äù imparted by an innocent sacrifice. The very first sacrifice recorded in the Torah - performed by God Himself - prefigured the coming redemption by the ‚Äúseed of the woman‚Äù who would die as a substitutionary sacrifice for their sins, and therefore Yeshua is rightly called ""the Lamb slain from the foundation (or beginning) of the world"" (Rev. 13:8). This further explains why Eve‚Äôs son (Abel) offered a blood sacrifice that was accepted by the LORD, whereas Cain‚Äôs offering the ‚Äúfruit of the earth‚Äù was rejected. The very first prophecy of Torah therefore describes - in the most succinct form - the coming of the Savior and the great conflict of the ages. First, God declares that He would put enmity (◊ê÷µ◊ô◊ë÷∏◊î) between Satan and the woman. This enmity, or ‚Äúhostile hatred,‚Äù was based on the memory of Eve‚Äôs misguided trust she evidenced in the garden. When Eve first sympathetically listened to the lies of the nachash (serpent), she immediately began her descent into exile and became a temptress herself. Her first step toward sin was a gullibility or openness that ultimately resulted in a lack of trust of God (which is part of the reason why we must be saved by trusting, as a ‚Äúlike-for-like‚Äù reversal of the original sin). At the very dawn of human history, then, we see that ‚Äútruth‚Äù (◊ê÷±◊û÷∂◊™) apart from God (◊ê) leads to death (◊û÷µ◊™). Eve was deceived because of Satan, but Adam deliberately chose to disobey God (2 Cor. 11:3; 1 Tim 2:14).

Friends from all over Israel and Europe joined me in celebrating my first week as Music Director of this wonderful orchestra. I was overjoyed to share the stage with the incredible musicians, meet the wonderful audience, and work alongside our dedicated team at the orchestra. We continued on with a second celebratory concert in Tel Aviv on Thursday. On Saturday morning, my wife Sarah and I woke up to the sound of explosions near our hotel. Soon enough, sirens were heard and we spent the day with my parents in and out of the bomb shelter in the basement of our hotel. Thanks to the kind help of friends in Israel, my family and I were able to secure seats on a flight home to Vienna on Sunday. I am at a complete loss for words as my friends, extended family, and the musicians of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, are still in Israel, facing unimaginable uncertainty and danger. I'm left speechless, overwhelmed with anger, shock, disbelief, and profound concern, distraught for my new musical family. A week that was meant to be a celebration of music and togetherness has been overshadowed by the harsh reality of terrorism and conflict. My thoughts are with Israel, and with all those who are enduring the unimaginable. It is impossible to know what to say or what to do. I hope for the safety of the people living through this hell, and send my deepest condolences to those who have lost friends and family in the most horrific of circumstances.",,385,"{'like_count': 93, 'comment_count': 33, 'num_users': 46424}",Julian Rachlin,,2023-10-11 18:48:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312451732_666742331478881_3943583881275988110_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=oUzrk3aFiggAX9x3qL2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMq7PyFQdQdEtJnFDmPH5HXUoe6HAETw-nWLF2g2BAFw&oe=655AE6B0,https://www.facebook.com/100044293603310/posts/865048838314895,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387849692_865048708314908_9171155321384363553_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rd4Genow0u0AX8QJWgx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAzJFaA1vEug8PehZz-wXHkVX0gaUXuakuMB2d8qCovOg&oe=6559E4DB

facebook,"MARRIAGE is a Continues Schooling... The fact that a man remains a husband makes him not only a survivor, but a person who understands marriage. Yet, each day, a husband is faced with temporary defeats that if allowed, will rob the marriage of lasting relationship and happiness. ‚ÄòMARRIAGE is a long journey, not a destination. It demands a strong and positive self-imaged man called a husband to command it.‚Äô Hopefully, a husband must also understand that the future of the marriage relationship rests in the lessons he learns from these temporary set-backs. One set-back is conflict in the home. Once couples are married, they have to deal with the inevitability of arguments and conflict. Couples who deal poorly with arguments and conflict build up a history of negative emotional interactions that erodes marital satisfaction. ‚ÄòHusbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.‚Äô (1 PETER 3:7-9) ‚ÄòMen are protectors and maintainers of women'",,381,"{'like_count': 259, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 507915}",Thoughts of Jacktone,,2023-10-11 04:49:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338001205_1368720427298146_7411246640499111275_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y2RUnb3oDQYAX-HSA0u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBqyqTelr8rLeEt81yumQygWi0FvjjsEBUdmYP8UoZ7VA&oe=655B2E12,https://www.facebook.com/100064148888578/posts/719498683531755,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387779715_719498346865122_749076046205303320_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XvQuvx1xtmwAX8HSv1u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDhoVLNxBxjaM6U1_L4CIaMRUSUqcSZoLAgoKijWr3C1A&oe=652B2385

facebook,"NFF and Togo Football Federation fight over possession of Gift Orban. Togo football federation has taken steps to stop Gift Orban's involvement with the Nigerian national team, with claims that Orban is of Togolese nationality and therefore eligible to represent Togo at the international competition.. Report suggested that Orban's exclusion from the Super Eagles' Squad for November friendly is stems from an ongoing national dispute where Nigerian football federation (NFF) received correspondence from the Togolese FA asserting that Orban is of Togolese nationality.

facebook,"Ending the Israeli occupation, will end all bloodshed in Palestine Message by Neturei Karta International October 9,2023 The State of Israel and its Zionist ideology has resulted in unrelenting Arab and Jewish bloodshed. The outbreak of war this past weekend is another manifestation of the blood stained seeds that Zionism continues to sow on a daily basis. Anti-Zionist Jews once again hold the Zionist movement responsible for the latest tragic set of events suffered by both Arabs and Jews. For 75 years the State of Israel has oppressed and terrorized the Palestinian people, ruthlessly murdering men, women and children as they stole their land and took their homes. In their on-going effort to achieve their Zionist, colonialist aspirations, the State of Israel has deprived an entire people of basic human rights and have actualized an apartheid system under which the Palestinians have no control or even say in their daily lives. One of the fundamental Jewish religious beliefs is that the Jews are in a Divinely decreed exile. During this exile they are forbidden to create their own State. Furthermore the Torah forbids killing and stealing - Zionism goes contrary to all of these basic beliefs. It cannot be stated or emphasized enough, ""ZIONISM IS NOT JUDAISM. From its inception, masses of religious Jews in both Palestine and abroad totally opposed and rejected the Zionist movement and the existence of the State of Israel. Religious Jewish leaders expressed in no uncertain terms that the State of Israel goes contrary to Judaism and is dangerous to all inhabitants of the holy land, They warned that its existence would be catastrophic and only lead to bloodshed. Jews and Arabs lived in peace in Palestine for centuries, as in all other Arab lands. As Jews we are and have been extremely grateful for the hospitality accorded to us throughout the past. The present conflict is in no way due to differences in religions ‚Äì contrary to the Zionist narrative, which seeks to drive a wedge between Jews and Arabs. This historic trust, indeed friendship, peaceful respect and coexistence has been destroyed through Zionism and the Zionist occupation of Palestine and for decades has been the obstacle to peace. The one and only solution is to recognize the root cause and work toward a peaceful and total dismantlement of the State of Israel, to return control of the land to its indigenous inhabitants and restore all their rights. Only then can we expect a restoration to the historic peace that existed prior to Zionism.",,373,"{'like_count': 134, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 10287}",Neturei Karta,,2023-10-11 00:48:22,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/293037044_164633832793827_3301229653945931681_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ejUNwJAbZCIAX-wrb4W&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDNaP5WFNKzQxqUKr9qPGpcHdTyTgP_69kTb8lzs4aawA&oe=655AB14A,https://www.facebook.com/100077416347311/posts/348963271027548,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387179103_348959877694554_1929372671590823712_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Rc1dsAHBk6kAX9WVb04&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfApg1GPYk8swMtbABsMjnZq8NIMayJfjKmSAPD_2cLCqw&oe=65386057

In the midst of a world where the allure of the mundane and superficial often captures our attention, a significant segment of humanity has awoken to a deeper calling.* # *This current struggle is far more than a physical conflict; it is a battle of ideals, a war waged between the forces of an entrenched elite and the impassioned champions of liberation. What lies at the core of this monumental clash is the progression of the human spirit towards a higher plane of existence.* # *In the shadows of history's stage, the sparks of spiritual evolution are already ignited. A growing consensus among individuals echoes with the weariness of superfluous conflicts, the burdens of totalitarian rule, and the shackles of authoritarian control. The time has arrived for humanity to reclaim the limitless power that resides within each soul, to unlock the doors of the self-imposed mental prison, and to bask in the radiant illumination of unfettered freedom.* # *Picture, if you will, the dawn of a new era, where the resonance of unity transcends the discord of division. It is a time when the heart and soul of humanity sing in harmony, awakening to the profound interconnectedness that binds us all. The pursuit of materialism, celebrity obsession, and the trivial distractions of the Kardashian dynasty lose their allure, as individuals rediscover their spiritual essence.* # *With each step taken on this path of enlightenment, we move closer to realizing the profound truth that we are not mere bystanders in the unfolding drama of existence. We are the architects of our destinies, co-creators of a world founded on love, compassion, and the profound realization of our interconnectedness.* # *The great war that shapes the future of human existence is, at its essence, a war of consciousness. It is an awakening to the power that resides within us, the power to reshape the world, to transcend the limitations that have bound us, and to emerge as beings of boundless potential.* # *As we embark on this transformative journey, may the light of awareness guide our steps and may the fires of spiritual evolution burn ever brighter within our hearts and souls.

Her Excellency was with us every step of the way, and we are eternally grateful. Heartfelt thanks to our brother Tamir Khan who, notwithstanding his personal situation, offered his invaluable support through thick and thin. Also, Shay Daudi for his hospitality and generosity, and all the people who helped us make it through this difficult time. Our gratitude goes to Hades management, Rene Farrugia, who helped us organize this tour and was a constant support throughout. Our journey started on an excellent note with the event at the Wunderbar Club, Haifa. We immensely enjoyed our time there with Proxy , ZedDestructive and a very warm crowd. The management and staff of the club were the perfect hosts. Another memorable evening was at The Wave Club in Tel Aviv. Such amazing people. From there, everything changed with a dramatic fashion. Due to the situation, the gigs in Tel Aviv, with our brothers of Interia and Jerusalem with Xoter, Goregamel and Paranoid Existence were cancelled while we safely waited for development and started working on ways to get out of Israel. Our thoughts go to our friends in Israel. May you and your loved ones be safe. You are in our hearts, thoughts and prayers. Thank you to all who showed concern and offered support for our difficult situation. Above all, our families and loved ones who had to go through this ordeal with us. No words of gratitude will ever be enough. Our thoughts remain with our friends who are still caught in the conflict. Our plight might be over but theirs is ongoing.

facebook,"I warned on Sunday that it would get ugly. I should add, it‚Äôs not only quite ugly, it‚Äôs also grown deceptive and dangerous.

The political gamesmanship by the GOP in Washington continues apace over the terrorist attack out of Gaza. In my piece yesterday, I touched upon three aspects of this: misinformation over the Iranian deal, blaming the White House for failure of intel, and the current paralysis and lack of House leadership in Congress.

Today, I unfortunately need to add three more things to that list. First, Republicans opened a new line of attack on Monday by implying that President Biden has been absent and unresponsive to the crisis. Second, right-wing agitators, from Elon Musk to Eric Trump, have been busily spreading misinformation and anti-semitism. And third, with a hold still in place on many diplomatic appointments, led by Sen. Rand Paul and others in the Senate, the State Department has been hampered at the very time key regional leadership is needed.

Let‚Äôs dive into these and the politics of the crisis as it plays out here in the U.S. in Part 2 of this series (which I hope is actually over after today).

**‚ÄúWhere is President Biden?‚Äù

The right is convinced that Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have the stamina and leadership qualities to see us through an international crisis, and so they predictably push narratives that fit that false claim. With respect to the Gaza crisis, they claimed on Fox and across social media that Biden was largely absent from the scene.

‚ÄúWhere is President Biden?‚Äù demanded former Trump press secretary Ari Fleishcher.

‚ÄúPresident Biden is nowhere to be seen and nothing to say,‚Äù declared Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR).

The criticism grew out of the White House calling a ‚Äúlid‚Äù yesterday with the press just before noon. Critics immediately went on the attack.

‚ÄúWith war raging in Israel, the White House called a lid for Joe Biden at 11:46am,‚Äù said Fox anchor John Roberts on the X platform. Roberts of course is a seasoned anchor and knows that a lid is not what he implied by this statement.

White nationalist and former White House advisor Stephen Miller falsely stated, ‚ÄúA lid means reporters can go home because no more news is happening. You won‚Äôt miss anything. The day is done.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIn this case, it probably means President Biden is taking a nap.‚Äù

More responsible and reasonable voices, however, hit back with the truth. Citing Miller‚Äôs statement, legal analyst Joyce Vance noted, ‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòa lid‚Äô appears to have meant something very different in the Trump administration. Perhaps Stephen Miller reveals too much when he suggests it means the president is napping? Joe Biden is almost certainly in the situation room & otherwise staying on top of the conflict.‚Äù

White House spokesman John Kirby pushed back on Fox‚Äôs questions about the ‚Äúlid,‚Äù reminding that the fact that the President has no public events doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not working. ‚ÄúHe is working. He stayed updated throughout the day. He will be talking to foreign leaders,‚Äù Kirby clarified.

Indeed, later in the day, a remarkable joint statement on Israel emerged from the five leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and the U.S. It is both forceful and nuanced, and it included the following clear statement and warning to third party actors:

‚ÄúWe make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned. There is never any justification for terrorism.  In recent days, the world has watched in horror as Hamas terrorists massacred families in their homes, slaughtered over 200 young people enjoying a music festival, and kidnapped elderly women, children, and entire families, who are now being held as hostages.

Our countries will support Israel in its efforts to defend itself and its people against such atrocities. We further emphasize that this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage.

All of us recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike. But make no mistake: Hamas does not represent those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed.‚Äù

In short, the White House called a ‚Äúlid‚Äù and made no public appearances because it was doing the hard work of international diplomacy. The attacks by the GOP during a time of crisis continue to undermine U.S. foreign interests and present an opening for our enemies to exploit.

**Amplification of misinformation and antisemitism

The collapse of safeguards on the site formerly known as Twitter following its takeover by Elon Musk carried evident and troubling consequences in the last 24 hours. Faked videos of alleged attacks, some actually pulled from video games, proliferated across the site with little to no effort to moderate or remove them.

Eric Trump even got in the game, sharing a video of artillery fire while (truncated)",,356,"{'like_count': 184, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 9395438}",George Takei,,2023-10-11 01:43:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/272452483_470819554415894_2093320837450724405_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=T0u5JMmSdbkAX9tTzeh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA6aZkS7aIuBMo0vftxcJGJtRcVCVbwgXFU1_drTHhiA&oe=655A9EEE,https://www.facebook.com/100044635590185/posts/857026645795181,
facebook,"Words matter. A number of media organisations have editorial guidelines directing them not to use the term 'terrorist' in their reporting of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. These guidelines may be borne out of well-intentioned aspirations to appear accurate and impartial. But there is a point at which the failure to use the term 'terrorist', is itself a failure of accuracy and impartiality. The depth of the terror that Hamas has inflicted upon innocent people across Israel in recent days is not in doubt. The murder of babies where they sleep is not the act of a 'freedom fighter'. The performative desecration of dead bodies for the benefit of social media, the rape of women and the beheading of civilians in their homes, are not the acts of 'militants'. The true motives of Hamas could not be clearer. It seeks the murder of Jews and the annihilation of the Jewish state. Their charter says as much. Hamas is no different to ISIS. Did decent, moral people seek to justify the actions of 9/11, 7/7 or the Manchester Arena bombing? It should be painfully obvious that there is no moral equivalence between those whose motive is to deliberately target innocent civilians in cold blood, and those whose motive is to remove the threat of such murderers. The fact that this discussion is necessary at all is a clear sign that we are losing our moral compass and of the warped nature of the depths to which discourse on Israel has sunk. And so I call upon broadcasters to urgently change the way they describe Hamas. Further, I call upon all decent people to have the courage to call out this terror for what it is. We must all be unequivocal that the loss of any innocent life is a tragedy, and that the barbaric, murderous terrrorism of Hamas cannot be denied or obfuscated. It is a matter of deepest regret that some feel otherwise. This is not 'resistance' or 'struggle'. It is terrorism.

facebook,"10ID awards medal to soldier who apprehends a snatcher in Tagum City Mawab, Davao De Oro - Private First Class Junnel M Perdido, a soldier of the 10th Installation and Management Battalion (10IMB), was awarded the Bronze Cross Medal during the Monday Flag Raising Ceremony held at Camp General Manuel T. Yan Senior in Mawab, Davao De Oro on October 9, 2023. PFC Perdido fearlessly pursued a snatcher who stole the wallet of Mrs. Lorife Ulep, containing P30,000.00 as payment for her daughter's hospital bill at Aquino Hospital, Tagum City, on September 28. PFC Perdido's heroic act did not involve actual conflict but rather a life-threatening risk as he chased and apprehended the snatcher hiding in a nearby village despite the potential danger. Brigadier General Allan D Hambala, Acting Commander of the 10th Infantry (Agila) Division, personally pinned the medal on PFC Perdido and subsequently commended his heroism and dedication to duty. In an interview, Mr. Efren Ulep, the victim's husband, expressed his gratitude for PFC Perdido's heroism. ""Mabuti sir at may tumulong. Hindi na man siya duty diba, pero si sir (referring to PFC Perdido) ginamit niya ang sinumpaan niya,"" Mr. Ulep said in vernacular. PFC Perdido is a member of the Morale and Welfare Recovery Center of the 10IMB under the Operational Control of the 10ID. He was at the hospital with his pregnant wife and daughter for a medical check-up while on leave. #latest #news #LatestNews #Update #NewsUpdate #supportourtroops #SundaloSalamatsaSerbisyo #AFPyoucanTRUST",,350,"{'like_count': 207, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 350772}",AFP Radio DWDD,,2023-10-11 11:39:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/386506671_708974191262152_7017919564341936069_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CClrFqqBV90AX9531eY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA48VvV1M3B6ljmYfz-oKeMqzBqJ4OKipP1YOFP2suy3A&oe=655A53A5,https://www.facebook.com/100064487330410/posts/713811857445052,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391519742_713801510779420_3190996525392304455_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XobnjiTUcE8AX_3ALyI&_nc_oc=AQnFkseVTv2pTn79zuty7SCn9zGpjQVjDesTa_-a9XyXI-PLWdzTrgAaG1dRJnd5BGc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCwrIB_QBNan75M9Rz8Hmzkb8B8g4dA2Ze0oUgL7otN2w&oe=652BE1C8

Dalam Databook, Hamura menerima kepemimpinan Otsutsuki dari Hagoromo dan bermigrasi bersama klanya kebulan, menyisakan sisa clanya dibumi yg akan menjadi Clan Hyuga, Tidak jelas bagaimana asal usul keturunan Hamura dibumi hampir tidak tercatat sejarah nya, kemungkinan besar asal usul Hyuga banyak dihapus Oleh Zetsu Hitam, ini untuk menghindari Manusia bumi berhubungan dengan Otsutsuki Bulan. Selain menerima kepemimpinan dari Hagoromo untuk menjadi pemimpin Otsutsuki menggantikan Ibunya, Hamura lagi2 harus memilih Cara yg menyakitkan demi kedamaian, mengekang Semua anggota clannya untuk menghindari Conflict dengan Shinobi bumi yg merupakan Pengikut Hagoromo, Hamura benar2 Percaya bahwa Hagoromo dengan ajaran nya akan membawa perdamaian, percaya bahwa dalam 1000 tahun akan ada kedamaian, mengetahui janji 1000 tahun yg dijanjikan Hagoromo, Hamura memutuskan untuk menyegel semua Mata Byakugan clannya untuk menghindari Konflik dengan Shinobi Bumi dalam ratusan tahun kedepan, ini adalah keputusan Hamura yg benar2 mendukung ideologi Hagoromo. Kedamaian tidak akan didapatkan tampa perjuangan, walaupun pengorbanan sering kali terjadi. Tapi apa yg ditangkap Oleh Toneri berbeda dengan apa yg di inginkan hamura, Toneri menganggap bahwa Janji Yg diberikan Hagoromo kepada Hamura telah usai, dan melihat bahwa Bumi tidak Damai sejak era Hagoromo, Toneri mengambil kesimpulan keliru bahwa setelah janji 1000 tahun, Maka keluarga Otsutsuki bulan bisa menghukum Shinobi Bumi. Bagi Hamura tidak ada janji, apa yg disampaikan Hagoromo adalah Ramalan, dan Hamura mempercayai nya, mengorbankan Clanya hanyalah Tujuan agar Clan Bulan tidak ikut campur dengan Kehidupan Shinobi Bumi dan ini adalah kedamaian yg dia percayai serta memberikan kontribusi kedapa Shinobi Bumi. Ini merupakan cerita bagaimana Hamura dan Ideologi nya mampu membawa kedamaian sekaligus menjaga Gedo Mazo dari Bulan, sangat Buruk jika Otsutsuki bulan tidak menyegel Byakugan nya, ini hanya akan menciptakan Konflik lebih besar antara Otak Bulan dan Shinobi Bumi. Apa yang dilakukan Hamura mungkin terlalu Ekstrim, tapi itu adalah pilihan terbaik yg ada. Resiko memiliki banyak keturunan OP. Ikatan Saudara yg luar Biasa.

facebook,"A new report has emerged that the junta regime faces heavy defeat in Karen state. The KNU claims that during this period, approximately 4,000 junta soldiers have lost their lives, while over 2,200 soldiers have sustained injuries. These numbers highlight the significant toll that the conflict has taken on the junta forces. On the KNU side, the organization has also faced casualties. More than a hundred comrades have been reported killed, and close to 400 comrades have been wounded. These figures underline the sacrifices made by the KNU in their struggle for self-determination and fighting against the junta regime. According to KNU, Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and Karen National Defense Organisation (KNDO) joined together in the fight against the junta regime, with a total of 3570 battles fought and 112 comrades killed.

facebook,"Israel forms emergency government against Hamas as deaths and damage in Gaza mount Israel formed an emergency unity government on Wednesday as its jets pounded Gaza and tanks massed around the densely populated Palestinian enclave while Hamas militants said they were still fighting on Israeli territory following their shock weekend incursion. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to form a war cabinet with former defence minister and centrist opposition party leader Benny Gantz and focus entirely on the conflict, a joint statement from Gantz's National Unity party said. Israel's death toll rose to 1,200 with over 2,700 wounded, its military said, from Hamas militants' hours-long rampage after breaching the fence enclosing Gaza on Saturday. U.S. President Joe Biden has issued a warning seemingly aimed at Hamas' Iranian supporters not to exploit the Gaza conflagration to start a wider Middle East war. Israeli reprisal strikes on blockaded Gaza have killed 1,100 people and wounded 5,339, Gaza's Health Ministry said. Some 535 residential buildings had been destroyed leaving around 250,000 homeless, Hamas officials said. Most of the displaced were in U.N.-designated shelters, others huddling in shattered streets. The group's armed wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said it was still fighting inside Israel on Wednesday. Israel deployed tanks and armoured vehicles just north of Gaza where the clashes were reported, but had no immediate comment on the Hamas claim. Later in the day, alerts warning of incoming aircraft were issued across northern Israel, well removed from Gaza in the south, but the Israeli military subsequently said these may have been a malfunction. A Reuters TV crew saw a house hit by an apparent projectile near Metulla in Israel's far north, close to the border with south Lebanon where the heavily armed Iran-backed Hezbollah group is active. Hamas's armed wing said it had targeted the northern Israeli coastal city of Haifa with an R60 rocket. There were no immediate reports of casualties after sirens sounded in Haifa and nearby towns. Israel has vowed swift punishment for the deadliest Palestinian militant attack in its 75-year history, which left corpses strewn around a music festival and a kibbutz community. The military said dozens of its fighter jets struck more than 200 targets in a neighbourhood of Gaza City overnight that it said had been used by Hamas to launch its attacks. ""We started the offensive from the air, later on we will also come from the ground,"" Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told soldiers near the fence on Tuesday. Israel has put Gaza under ""total siege"" to stop food and fuel reaching the enclave of 2.3 million people, many poor and dependent on aid. Hamas media said on Wednesday electricity went out after the only power station stopped working. With Palestinian rescue workers overwhelmed, others in the crowded coastal strip joined the search for bodies in rubble. ""I was sleeping here when the house collapsed on top of me,"" one man cried as he and others used flashlights on the stairs of a building hit by missiles to find anyone trapped. The Israeli military said its troops had killed at least 1,000 Palestinian gunmen who infiltrated from Gaza and the Chief of the General Staff met commanders to discuss their next steps.

facebook,"The unblocking of sexual energy is among one of the most incredible experiences anyone can have. I can speak from my own personal experience, but it is seeing and hearing about these results in my clients that really reiterated to me how incredible and also important this experience is. Most people will find themselves strangely drawn to sexual energy, and many may perceive this as a perversion to battle. This is in sharp contrast to ancient sex positive cultures that saw sexuality as a sacred and life giving force akin to the divine. Have people changed so much since this time? Our bodies have not but the way we think has. Our bodies still hold the memory of a utopia past, a Garden of Eden where people were free simply to be, without the stresses of civilisation. An innocent state of embodiment, pure love and raw natural being. Awakened sexual energy is the very epitome of the opposite of the conflict ridden sexual dynamics of our present day. That‚Äôs because when sexual energy is in flow, we are in flow. When it‚Äôs blocked, we block up. Tonight I‚Äôm hosting the second day of my live event. Yesterday I taught how to create a healthy sexuality by hacking the energy field and connecting love and orgasmic energy. ~The Art of the Bed Chamber Gratitude to unknown artist Healing Intimacy https://EmpowerWholeness.com:=:https://www.empowerwholeness.com/",,306,"{'like_count': 156, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 96074}",Healing Intimacy,,2023-10-11 16:36:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/337868247_2738531212963630_3833005927936680761_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=doOW6BXIMTsAX-vf7lg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBql3ANW0pQsF9FPgXd7O0g8kcZfI9tdvxniRs7Lwvsfg&oe=655A304C,https://www.facebook.com/100090044953305/posts/269254929419337,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391681763_269254332752730_620733901226007492_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=lhD5MYwYSAIAX_qi6IT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBNJKjHj2pDmRltZfqciVgKf9S3UEegQ1wXZBxfoMqgAQ&oe=6540DB07

facebook,"My husband was looking into Ricardo Sotil who is running for First Selectman. He noticed Rick has said in multiple meetings that he resides at 426 South Grand St. As we live around the corner, he questioned how this building could possibly be a residence. It has been a commercial building used by Sotil Tree for a long time. The Town does not allow for commercial and residential at the same property. My husband did a FOIA with the Town for all records and correspondence for that address and he came across this information. As you can see, Rick was told to vacate the building as a use of residence by the building department back in July. He still states this address in Town meetings. Upon further investigation, my husband looked up, on the Secretary of State website the annual filing's for Rick's businesses. As you can see he certified and stated under the penalties of false statements that he resides at 6 Valley View Dr, East Granby. He listed his business address as 426 South Grand St, Suffield and his mailing address as a p.o. box in East Granby. How can Rick claim to live in Suffield when he also claims to be a resident of East Granby? Per section 202 of the Town Charter this should make him ineligible. Rick has either lied under penalty of false statement to the State of CT in his business filings or is lying to State of CT in his campaign filings and also lying to the residents of this Town. The evidence is very clear from these documents. Furthermore, one of Rick's claims is that he is running as an unaffiliated. Did you know not more than 6 months ago he was a registered Democrat in East Granby? He attended numerous Suffield Democrat Town Committee (DTC) meetings for the past year in hopes to secure their nomination. The DTC refused to nominate him. Why? He claims no party politics. Didn't seem that way a couple months ago. Rick is also suing the Town because he was denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Zoning Board of Appeals in regards to his request for growing Marijuana at his ""residence/business."" The Town created a special zoning ordinance for this. Why doesn't Rick just follow these regulations? Is this a direct conflict of interest for him to run for the Town's top elected position? Is his goal here to try to settle his own case? Isn't it convenient that his timing on this matter and effort to run for this position line up perfectly? In addition, Rick's campaign has been assisted by the Hornish's whose dog mauled an elderly woman to death and also have a lawsuit against the Town. Is this an attempt by them to have the suits settle in their interests? Rick claims he's all for transparency yet these facts tell a different story. Suffield residents deserve better than Rick Sotil and his lies.",,295,"{'like_count': 75, 'comment_count': 175, 'num_users': 23087}",Suffield Forum,,2023-10-11 20:32:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/381050716_10227589257291765_6088211694268590666_n.jpg?stp=c16.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=06jcQpX0CJwAX9jnLQl&_nc_oc=AQlVYr-9bWrUSPmeXA4MdLmu9bDJRRRQWNUGXPRFHeDfSxB1Y7SRuhI3qExVca_nWnQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAUd89sM3HX0ZusphfgR_76bH7oS7VkI3KTw7Qrp0cD7g&oe=655AA6A8,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1522879984620018/permalink/3681522122089116,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391717838_10225094727900005_5238472148552319633_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ASUGujah1lAAX8ugTR5&_nc_oc=AQmTdS5Gm7u6OuQv3FxeVpp0EUc-Cp1FpPbK4bL2upcx5Q6F06Gb7GkwWm9JSpQOvFQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCoOXYRazh8JPXlAsoHZ3dqoV-THdWEWHETIAche_LbJg&oe=652C437F

facebook,"Reactive vs. Receptive State of Mind Daniel Siegel, in his book ‚ÄúThe Whole-Brain Child,‚Äù talks about when the children are on guard, defensive, or angry, they are in a reactive state of mind. They interpret everything negatively and are not receptive to the positive. In the heat of the moment, it is not time to rationalize with the child, scold, or counsel them. They are too reactive (emotional) to look at things rationally. They are operating from their ‚Äúemotional brain,‚Äù not their ‚Äúthinking, reasoning brain.‚Äù Some children are in the on-guard, reactive state of mind most of the time. Because of either biological makeup or past experiences, they do not feel safe, are on high alert, and are always looking for the negative. They walk through life with filtered glasses on, looking for, and interpreting things in a negative light. Usually, these children have poor self-esteem and tend to look for negative intent from others. I see this a lot in autistic children. Not necessary the negativism (although in some yes), but being emotionally ‚Äúreactive,‚Äù and less often in a ‚Äúreceptive‚Äù state of mind. Autistic children will often freak when things don‚Äôt go according to their expectations and view every little change as a threat to their existence. Uncertainty drives them nuts. They need predictability and must control everything they do to maintain that predictability. They are on-guard and anxious and quickly panic when things don‚Äôt go according to plan. They are quick to react from their emotional part of the brain, with little mediation from the thinking brain. Research has shown that autistic individuals have a higher level of stress (anxiety) chemicals in their nervous system, even during a resting state. These high levels of stress chemicals leave the nervous on high-alert for threat! When they are hyper-vigilant for threat, they will be looking for the negative and react quickly to stay safe (reactive state of mind). They are going to react quickly and intensively, often over-reacting to the conflict. This hyper-reactive state is natural, given their sensory, emotional, and social processing difficulties. Between sensory bombardment and overload that leaves their nervous systems vulnerable to insult and the constant difficulties understanding and regulating with others, their nervous systems are on ‚Äúhigh alert‚Äù and ready to react, to stay safe. This hyper-alertness is an instinctual mechanism in the brain to be ‚Äúon guard‚Äù when possible threat is near. The brain is ready to ‚Äúfight or flee‚Äù at any moment. When the possibility of sensory insult and social discourse is frequently present, the nervous system becomes conditioned to be in a ‚Äúreactive‚Äù mode most of the time. What to do. 1. Know your child‚Äôs state of mind. Know what state of mind (brain) your child is operating from. What are they like when ‚Äúreceptive,‚Äù and what are they like when ‚Äúreactive.‚Äù When they are in a defensive, reactive state, it is not the time to ‚Äúcommand and demand.‚Äù It is only going to push their panic button. It is not the time to tell them what and why because they are not receptive to listening. Listen to their perspective and validate their feelings before trying to negotiate. Try not to reason with them verbally, convince them that they are wrong, or do things differently. Wait until the child is calm and in a receptive state to collaborate. 2. A good portion of angry outbursts from children are when adults ignore this principle and try to demand and direct, scold, or counsel the child when they are emotionally in turmoil. Like Dr. Ross Greene, author of ‚ÄúThe Explosive Child,‚Äù states, ‚ÄúMost problems don‚Äôt come from a rigid and inflexible child alone, but when a rigid/inflexible child meets a rigid/inflexible adult.‚Äù (Paraphrase) We must be the flexible ones to bring the child to a flexible (receptive) state. 3. It is important to help the child feel safe, accepted, and competent throughout the day, so their nervous system is less defensive and more receptive. Help the child obtain a receptive state of mind and keep them there. All the toolbox strategies on this page are focused on moving the child from the defensive/reactive mode to a safe and receptive state. Understand and respect the child‚Äôs comfort zones and help them feel competent stretching these comfort zones. 4. When emotions are flying, in the heat of the moment, respond to the ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù first, then the behavior. When the child is upset, do not scold, counsel, demand, or teach when emotional. As discussed before, acknowledge and validate the feelings behind the behavior first before dealing with the behavior. You don‚Äôt have to agree with the behavior; just validate the feelings behind the behavior. Once the emotion subsides, then collaborate. Of course, if the behavior is dangerous, you must block and interrupt the behavior, but then focus on tackling the feelings before discussing how to deal with the behavior. The child is not in a receptive state for (truncated)",,287,"{'like_count': 161, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 253047}",Autism Discussion Page,,2023-10-11 09:50:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/308486753_455387376623796_2443018258288336512_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=gJPWn5eBRe4AX9BHeE2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAaW-Ol7YKZlWvqwgYBzN4NF4d9vmmMl6sEo2zNhQ3WCA&oe=6559BB9C,https://www.facebook.com/100064576130912/posts/705939594901905,

We also wholly reject the violations to which the country's male and female citizens are exposed, their exposure to killing, forced displacement, and their loss of their livelihoods, their money, and everything they possess, without any right or consideration given to them by both sides of the conflict. Weapons do not bring peace, and wars do not lead to safety. Most wars ended with peace agreements but with heavy loss of life and complete destruction of the economy in the country. Sudan and its citizens have reached their worst since the beginning of this war. Therefore, this war must stop immediately. Strength does not lie in those who win the war, but weakness is always in those who lose peace. To the honourable People's Armed Forces in our national institutions, know well that our position on this accursed war is not against you, but it is against your leaders and against everyone who harms the soil and citizens of this country and whom we know very well does not care about the peace of this country and the safety of its people. No to war is our stance for the sake of Sudan first and the citizens second, and this is what you have given an oath to and what we swore to in our glorious revolution, which we sacrificed with precious blood for all of us... __________________________ _#Know well that we are in the same trench... _ ‚Åß‚Ä´#ÿßŸÑÿØÿπŸÖ_ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ±Ÿäÿπ_Ÿäÿ≠ÿßÿ±ÿ®_ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿßÿ∑ŸÜŸäŸÜ‚Ä¨‚Å© #ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿ©_ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸäÿ©_ÿ™ŸÜÿ∏ŸäŸÖ_ÿßÿ±Ÿáÿßÿ®Ÿä #ŸÑÿßÿ≤ŸÖ_ÿ™ŸÇŸäŸÅ #ŸÑÿß_ŸÑŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ÿ® ‚Å¶‚Ä™#RSF_FIGHTS_CITIZES",,284,"{'like_count': 76, 'comment_count': 102, 'num_users': 72718}",ŸÑÿ¨ÿßŸÜ ŸÖŸÇÿßŸàŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑÿµÿ≠ÿßŸÅÿ©,,2023-10-11 10:32:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311573172_472952931543186_6556791741961453764_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hJZRGdFtdX8AX93lyLa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC5jAM-MsFtiV9rC0VITCgU-btHmQjgAMr1B9Sxjvwu3w&oe=655A1E89,https://www.facebook.com/100064854483434/posts/707361808102296,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391611872_707361771435633_4079539408993112703_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=paxk-NXQySUAX8L3hK-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC8Kg5LGIdHwiUzEPM6WY1KVzPlboKVVU6VTDACbrdvGw&oe=654BE197

facebook,"In a recent update on the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict, the safety of the Bnei Menashe community in Israel, an ethnic Mizo Jewish group, has been a topic of concern. The Mizos reached out to inquire about the Bnei Menashe's well-being amidst the continuing hostilities. Reports indicate that, while the Bnei Menashe are spread across Israel, the majority reside in the northern part of the country, which has, thankfully, been spared from rocket attacks. As per available information, no casualties have been reported within the community. However, there is an unconfirmed report of a Bnei Menashe woman remaining missing since Saturday. Like other communities in Israel, the Bnei Menashe youths, who serve as reservists and in active roles within the Israeli Defence Forces, have been called up for duty. So far, there are no reports of casualties among them. The ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel has resulted in a tragic toll, with at least 2055 lives lost in just five days. Gaza Strip has faced constant bombardment from Israel, while Israeli cities near the Gaza Strip continue to endure rocket attacks. The Bnei Menashe, a sub-group of the Mizo community who follow Judaism, are the second-largest Mizo ethno-religious group after the Mizo Christians. Like other ethnic Jews, they are entitled to make Aliyah, which is the Jewish concept of returning to Israel, and immigrate into the country as recognized ethnic Jews. This privilege is not extended to most other communities claiming Jewish ancestry. Currently, several thousand Bnei Menashe have made Israel their home, while many others continue to live in India alongside Mizo Christians. #israelnews #Palestinians #Mizoram #themizos",,279,"{'like_count': 211, 'comment_count': 43, 'num_users': 40678}",The Mizos,,2023-10-11 15:31:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/245038334_4274104242636820_6326084879574661047_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=azugYkD_aMwAX8r3t-K&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBpd-iZ20T3vz9pnS1Cgrwz6ZdY4TWTo3JUqCGHrUOu7w&oe=655A68CB,https://www.facebook.com/100077578996090/posts/337122852217012,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391528134_337122742217023_6227037385967706279_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=TK82_aDUNbkAX-2zAqX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCTlKWfFhrXNXISxh9GtrYkwj_MimhYhFVQC0w_iennAg&oe=652B8088

With the exception of Yeoman Rand who lasted only 5 episodes (because of conflict..etc..) in season 1, and after the first pilot, the networks wanted to get rid of the guy with the pointy ears ( Spock) .. everyone seems to live happily ever after.. So, here's a good mind boggler for all the fans.. If there was one of the MAIN characters who didn't want to come back for another season, WHO do you think would have left and HOW would they have killed them off...? Either, no appearance and just explain that he/she left the ship.. - Have them killed off in a transporter accident... - Phasered or killed by enemy.. - Transferred to another ship or got their own command... I think that maybe Chekov or Sulu would have left the ship for their own command or transfer..! :) which, basically happens in the movies.",,273,"{'like_count': 170, 'comment_count': 74, 'num_users': 154010}",Star Trek the Original Series & Movies,,2023-10-11 14:26:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/292238145_5312621665486323_2540681092444771744_n.jpg?stp=c13.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Vcnvi6NDT6AAX_JeZJ7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDBnwRu0Wv4VVYIT8N-65TYX3N1eMjTUFw5u34stf_tqw&oe=655AF498,https://www.facebook.com/groups/227079345953752/permalink/727349099260105,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391620068_10161374733254002_3783009819635897881_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=l-1Mji4wrQ4AX90B8iN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBdK4sxk1JVBupvW0LUcfkpg94Dsf8zoyTGTVRnqKMlPA&oe=652BF40C

facebook,"Every 2 - 2.3 years a new set of problems and troubles appear to mobilize the world and our minds and energy. This corresponds to the cycle of Mars. When Mars joins the Sun a new Mars pattern is imprinted. Let‚Äôs look back in the last few years. In September 2019- Mars Joins the Sun in Virgo- the sign of health and disease- we know what followed in the next 2.5 years‚Ä¶. All focus was on the pandemic. In October 2021 Mars joined the Sun in Libra, pretty much within 4-5 months the focus shifted from illness to war / peace (Libra). The following 2 years the world split into 2 factions. New powerful economic alliances started forming: western countries vs Brics and the East. But Libra is a more gentle sign, it never grew into a big world conflict. There was more of an re-arrangement of trading alliances and economic powers. (Libra) Now we are on the verge of a new Mars cycle and we see the shifting energies. Just less than a month before the Mars conjunction with the Sun in Scorpio, the war in the Middle East erupted. Scorpio is a way more ruthless and deadly sign. The diplomatic gloves of Libra come off, no more negotiations, political and economic sanctions and such, now a real threat and destructive approach is forming. There are calls to arms, mobilizing multiple countries, calls for no mercy and total annihilation. Both sides are in a deadly grip. Extreme response and deeply emotional reaction becomes the norm, clouding reason, spurred by revenge and power. There are hidden forces and motives at work too. Scorpio rules the vested and hidden interests of a small powerful faction. While Libra cycle was able to keep the balance, Scorpio cycle is all or nothing. War, destruction, purging‚Ä¶ are qualifies Scorpio carries. Will humanity be able to keep it humaneness?! Rebirth after destruction and total transformation is also Scorpio.",,268,"{'like_count': 156, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 83053}",AstroLada,,2023-10-11 12:03:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/279000458_543030600514064_5504214810282389277_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=o1htww_Kmv8AX-ap90c&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDNc8RsbI5TBaU9gf4Ca4zSSp2DClX9z1VEB8t473G3jg&oe=6559FF41,https://www.facebook.com/100044213870265/posts/870578477759273,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387828948_870861941064260_5141891872697221262_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=_WiogoCi0fMAX-HQCE-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfATypxDZXLNalJWoeQUJgGs4srujknnWablaZlzfKKT6A&oe=652B4524

The unprecedented scale and scope of the Hamas attacks has brought many around the world onto the streets. Supporters of both the pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian movements have gathered outside embassies and government buildings, further focusing the world's attention on the tensions between Israelis and Palestinians that have existed since before Israel's founding in 1948.

Our thoughts are with all people affected. Let‚Äôs hold space and compassion for the people of Palestinian and the Jewish community through this time as we work to continually center humanity.

‚ÄúMourning for the people of Palestine and the Jewish community, both communities who have shown up for the liberation of Black people for decades.
Navigating how to be an ally if you aren‚Äôt in either community is complex and I encourage you to center humanity during this time. Continue to speak against violence. Don‚Äôt get swept up in talking points.
If you don‚Äôt know what to say, know this. Your Palestinian friends are looking to you to know you see their humanity and right to a life without disenfranchisement. Your Jewish friends are looking to you to know you do not support the loss of innocent Jewish lives and that their Jewish identity does not mean they support the actions of the Israeli government. Your Palestinian friends are looking at you to demonstrate you don‚Äôt equate their existence to hamas and that additional innocent people shouldn‚Äôt face starvation, continuous violence and the stripping of their human rights. While your Jewish friends also want you to know their grief may be complex, and they deserve time to process, and that their mourning is not an endorsement of violence. Their fear and grief is valid and has a historical basis.
While there are loud extremists, there are even more people who are scared and trying to process - figuring out how to take action, how to grieve, and wondering how this can stop.
You can be critical of hamas and the Israeli government while holding space and compassion for Jewish and Palestinian people.
We need a solution that centers humanity. We cannot continue to justify any type of human rights violations.
And we must confront the reality that the failure to solve this conflict has allowed tension to boil in a way that‚Äôs putting innocent people at risk.‚Äù

instagram,"Sometimes silence is cowardice. Sometimes silence is presence. 

When Audre Lorde said, ‚Äúyour silence will not protect you‚Äù, she was speaking to people who have been silenced but had something to say. It was not a mandate to speak and center your own barely-formed opinions in the midst of every conflict. And it certainly was not a mandate to perform your pain or outrage in the public theater that is social media. 

Social media deceives us into thinking it is the supreme form of expression and justice work. But these spaces were not made to care for and protect Black women. And sometimes silence in this space frees you up to advocate better and with more sincerity and curiosity in another space. It does not mean silence in total. Do what feels just and sincere through whatever medium feels just and sincere.

instagram,"""Pronto una guerra cubrir√° al mundo en cenizas, y es tarea de los despiertos encontrar la chispa para encender de nuevo el fuego sagrado"".

Mensaje de Melkisedek, sacerdote de Jerusal√©n, en monte Tabor, Israel. Hace dos semanas.

Mientras me cubr√≠a en cenizas, describi√≥ la guerra que se acercaba, y nos dec√≠a una y otra vez que nos vayamos de all√≠, que nuestra misi√≥n era Egipto.

Sus palabras fueron claras: cuando vean las cenizas de la guerra, miren dentro y busquen su chispa interior para encender el mundo en luz. Mantengan ese fuego interno ante el conflicto. Lo √∫ltimo que necesitamos es miedo y juicio.

Qui√©nes est√°n atacando hoy a Israel no es el pueblo Palestino, quienes conviven con jud√≠os y cristianos y siguen el mensaje de unidad de Allah. Quienes est√°n atacando son terroristas.

Ninguna visi√≥n pol√≠tica puede justificar lo que se est√° viviendo. Esto no es una guerra entre dos pueblos, es un grupo terrorista provocando la muerte de propios y ajenos. 

Que las cenizas que caen sobre esta tierra enciendan la chispa de los corazones.

""Soon a war will cover the world in ashes, and it is the task of the awakened to find the spark to rekindle the sacred fire.""

Message from Melchizedek, priest of Jerusalem, on Mount Tabor, Israel. Two weeks ago.

As he covered me in ashes, he described the approaching war, telling us over and over again to get out of there, that our mission was Egypt.

His words were clear: ""when you see the ashes of war, look within and seek your inner spark to light the world in light. Maintain that internal fire in the face of conflict. The last thing we need is fear and judgment"".

Those who are attacking Israel today are not the Palestinian people, who live with Jews and Christians and follow Allah's message of unity.

instagram,"As I watch the carnage and the slow death of the people in Gaza unfold I hear the silence of cowards and I see the apathy of the heartless. I also see the hidden hand of the mainstream media. The 4th Branch is hard at work once again.¬†

2 days ago a report that was repeated until it didn‚Äôt matter if it was true anymore was debunked. The Israeli Army has admitted it has no confirmation of any babies, let alone 40 babies being decapitated. I remember after 9/11 there was a video circulating of Palestinians ‚Äúcheering the towers coming down.‚Äù It sparked anger and vitriol from Americans. And it was a fake too. The video was from 1992 with children cheering Arafats return from exile. How easily we are manipulated. This doesn‚Äôt mean that there are no crimes of war. When war comes morals are gone and there is only death, chaos and murder.¬†

I also want to point out that framing this as a ‚Äúreligious conflict‚Äù is wrong. That erases all of the Jewish people who support Palestinian rights and the those that are opposed to Zionism. Judaism is a beautiful religion that is thousands of years old and Zionism is a political ideology that was born in middle of the 19th century. It also erases the long struggle of Palestinian Christians who make up more than 20% of the population. They are also dying in Gaza.¬†

The other thing I have to say is this, if you support Israel and you‚Äôre reading please know that I don‚Äôt hate you. I think you‚Äôre misguided but I can‚Äôt hate you. You‚Äôve been told lies, and one of the biggest lies you‚Äôve been told is that America can protect you. You‚Äôre being used.

The USA can buy you weapons and a shield but it can‚Äôt stop the rockets and missiles from coming. It offers no stability, there‚Äôs no road map to peace, think about it, it‚Äôs just Israel on the front line of WW3 like a crash test dummy! Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan etc‚Ä¶ the US has lost most of its influence and has no moral high ground left in the Middle East.¬†

This war has exposed many things. Not just the inhumanity of a 75 year occupation but it has proved that the world is watching and we won‚Äôt be lied to anymore.¬†

Life-saving supplies ‚Äì including fuel, food and water ‚Äì must be allowed into Gaza. We need rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access now.

Sonny told me the inspiration for the larger Deathhead was a chance meeting in Southern California. The Oakland Hells Angels ran into some So Cal members. Neither group of men knew each other. 

They exchanged courtesy cards. Not long after that meeting Sonny started pushing for the style change. 

The larger style would cause much political conflict on the west coast. After many disagreements, some very serious, eventually the new style would become the standard throughout the world.

Amit Bar said her boyfriend, 26-year-old Nir De Jorno, wanted to take the photo so they could look at it when they got home, as a reminder of their strength and love for each other.

As Bar and De Jorno fled, they were separated from their friend Ziv Hajbi, 28. Bar told ABC News that Hajbi is still missing.

instagram,"The situation in Palestine demands our unwavering attention and discussion. Above all, the loss of innocent lives on any side is deeply distressing and must be brought to an end. In times of conflict, it is often the civilians who suffer the most.

At present, Palestinian civilians find themselves trapped in the midst of the ongoing tensions between the militant group Hamas, which governs the territory, and Israeli forces. This unrest escalated when Hamas initiated a large-scale, attack on Israel. According to Palestinian authorities, over 1,055 individuals have tragically lost their lives, with another 5,184 sustaining injuries in Gaza due to Israeli retaliatory actions.

Hundreds of residences, including refugee camps, have been obliterated in the Gaza Strip, forcing over 123,000 people to flee their homes. To exacerbate the situation, Israel has imposed a comprehensive blockade on the already besieged Gaza Strip, even restricting access to essential supplies like food and water.

At the heart of this conflict lies the unlawful occupation of Palestinian territories, a clear violation of international law. Those enduring this illegal occupation possess a legitimate right to resist, and the occupier bears full legal responsibility. Israel's actions have significantly contributed to the current escalation, with the government using this crisis as a diversion from its domestic concerns.

Moreover, Israel's political stance has resulted in a dwindling comprehension of its policies in the Western world. Once again, Palestinians are being depicted as the primary aggressors, while the Israeli military, equipped with nuclear capabilities, portrays its actions as self-defense against perceived threats. Israel's leadership can rely on the unfortunate reality that many Western media outlets often fail to provide the necessary critical analysis, perpetuating a cycle of misunderstanding.

instagram,"VAGUE MAGAZINE: As Australian newspapers provide readers with double page spreads explaining the complex history of the Gaza conflict this week, even the most unengaged voters have realised that the Indigenous Voice has not been given anywhere near the same focus.

The opportunity to keep Australians in the dark has been embraced by both the Nine Newspapers and NewsCorp, in effort to keep the waters as muddy as possible.

This intentionally vague coverage of a major moment in Australian history has only given rise to flat-earther levels of misinformation on social media, as Australians fall victim to conspiracy theories in their desperate search for answers.

Even the ABC have dedicated the vast majority of their referendum coverage to obsessively following the rollercoaster of Jacinta Price and Warren Mundine - two NO campaigners not well-known for discussing anything of substance.

In the final week of this misinformation vortex, a vast number of Australians are still asking 'Just tell me what the fuck this is?'

In short, the Indigenous Voice referendum is an opportunity for Australians to decide whether we include Indigenous people in our nation's passport-sized constitution - and provide them with a 'Voice To Parliament'

So basically, the Voice is a room in Parliament House for Indigenous elders and community leaders to convene ‚Äì and for politicians to visit if they have any questions they would like to ask about cultural protocol or unique experiences and circumstances.

Unfortunately, this information has not been readily available for any voters at any point throughout this campaign, for good reason, because our conservative media elites are terrified the Liberal Party might disappear if Peter Dutton doesn't land an easy win somewhere.

It's for this calculated lack of journalistic integrity, that one local Betoota grandmother is now learning about the Indigenous Voice through a grainy JPG of the Prime Minister dressed as a 1940s Soviet Dictator, complete with an Aboriginal flag manipulated to include a hammer and sickle - with block letters detailing completely illogical conspiracy theories riddled with spelling errors.

instagram,"Appeal: Urgent Support Needed For War Victims in Palestine

Donation Link Is In Highlights

We are reaching out to you today with a heartfelt appeal for your support and generosity. The ongoing conflict in Palestine has left countless innocent civilians, particularly women and children, in dire need of immediate assistance and humanitarian aid.

The situation has taken a devastating toll on the lives of people who have lost their loved ones, homes, and livelihoods. Hospitals and medical facilities are overwhelmed, struggling to cope with the increasing number of injured individuals who require urgent medical attention. The scarcity of basic necessities, such as food, clean water, and shelter, has plunged many into abject desperation.

In the face of such unimaginable suffering, we firmly believe in the power of collective action. Every amount, no matter how small, will make a significant impact in providing relief and rebuilding lives. Your support can help provide emergency medical supplies, food, water, and psychosocial support to those affected.

Together, we can assist humanitarian organizations on the ground who are working tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of war victims. Let us come together as a compassionate global community to extend a helping hand to our brothers and sisters in Palestine during this critical time.

Please consider making a generous contribution towards this cause. Your donation will provide solace and hope to those who have lost everything.

Whatever you do, don't research the history behind this current conflict in the Middle East. Just let your emotions guide you.. Actual critical thinking and considering the perspectives of both sides is far too difficult - it's best to outsource your thinking to the global military-industrial complex and mindlessly cheer on the escalation of death and destruction.

instagram,"The death toll in Israel and Palestine has soared to over 2,200, with at least 1,200 Israelis and 1,000 Palestinians killed since Hamas's incursion into southern Israel Saturday. The majority of Palestinian deaths are in Gaza; at least 18 deaths were reported in the West Bank. 

‚ÄúThis was an act of sheer evil. More than 1000 civilians slaughtered, not just killed, slaughtered, in Israel among them at least 14 American citizens killed,‚Äù U.S. President Joe Biden said in public remarks about the conflict on Tuesday. He did not refer to slain Palestinians or the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories in his remarks. 

President Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday as Israel is amassing some 300,000 reservists close to Gaza as it continues to pound the besieged enclave with airstrikes. Biden did not urge restraint in Israel's response to Hamas's attack.

The first shipment of advanced weaponry from the US arrived in Israel Tuesday and Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to land in Israel Thursday.",,10875,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 875, 'num_users': 614784}",Democracy Now!,,2023-10-11 13:41:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/60748357_665823390554827_4492143343274295296_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=FYFACqWrTzUAX-6ra7p&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDnBinZTKPOakMdSymzVwVsuNX_5tK-VFnzgenicpLzRQ&oe=6559E2CF,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyQrV1pMQ5m/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/387733300_1047703476259525_1431012304307066244_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=WMONCUQ3PxUAX8jIBBB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDTgZP6ZkWnH1BR75PyHlVGWiDys95F0pkziyGwzUA2wQ&oe=653518E5

instagram,"""Four days after the most catastrophic attack on Israel in its history, the scope of the fatalities and extent of the mental and physical damage have yet to become fully clear,"" writes Mairav Zonszein in a column for TIME.

""Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest serving Israeli Prime Minister, has made sidelining and ignoring Palestinian demands for freedom and dignity his mantra and legacy. He has repeatedly formulated his policies around the idea that Israel can resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict and proceed to normalize relations with Arab countries without engaging with the Palestinians.""

Zonszein, who is the Senior Israel-Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, argues Netanyahu undermined Israel's security. Read the full column at the link in bio.

Donation Link Is In Highlights

We are reaching out to you today with a heartfelt appeal for your support and generosity. The ongoing conflict in Palestine has left countless innocent civilians, particularly women and children, in dire need of immediate assistance and humanitarian aid.

The situation has taken a devastating toll on the lives of people who have lost their loved ones, homes, and livelihoods. Hospitals and medical facilities are overwhelmed, struggling to cope with the increasing number of injured individuals who require urgent medical attention. The scarcity of basic necessities, such as food, clean water, and shelter, has plunged many into abject desperation.

In the face of such unimaginable suffering, we firmly believe in the power of collective action. Every amount, no matter how small, will make a significant impact in providing relief and rebuilding lives. Your support can help provide emergency medical supplies, food, water, and psychosocial support to those affected.

Together, we can assist humanitarian organizations on the ground who are working tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of war victims. Let us come together as a compassionate global community to extend a helping hand to our brothers and sisters in Palestine during this critical time.

Please consider making a generous contribution towards this cause. Your donation will provide solace and hope to those who have lost everything.

instagram,"‚óè A little over a decade ago, a conflict in the Middle East showed the power of social media to keep global audiences informed about crises in real time. The way people used Facebook and Twitter during the uprisings known as the Arab Spring led to a surge of optimism about the important role these services could play for sharing information. Now another conflict in the Middle East is showing that the social media industry no longer sees that high-minded vision as part of its core mission.

‚óè In the hours after Hamas launched a large-scale attack on Israel over the weekend, people who turned to X, as Twitter is now known, were deluged with irrelevant or misleading reports, putting the consequences of Elon Musk‚Äôs loosening of content moderation rules on full display. Meta, meanwhile, has been very deliberately limiting the prominence of news and current events on services such as Facebook, Instagram and Threads.

‚óè The changes are a real issue for people who‚Äôve spent years relying on these social media platforms to understand what‚Äôs happening in the world.

instagram,"Israel is at war. It has been over 48 hours since Palestinian terrorists from Hamas launched a widespread invasion of Southern Israel. We now know that October 7, 2023 was the deadliest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust. More than 800 Israelis have been killed since the attack began, and Israeli national security advisers believe the number of fatalities will rise to over 1000.

An additional 2500 have been wounded, and it‚Äôs believed that approximately 100 Israelis are being held prisoner by the Palestinian terrorists in Gaza. 9 Americans are among those killed, with an unknown number of Americans among the wounded and abducted. Hezbollah has threatened American troops throughout the Middle East should the United States enter this conflict.

Since the unprovoked attack, Israel has routed the terrorists from all farming communities and towns bordering the Gaza Strip. More than 300,000 Israeli reservists have been mobilized with indications that Israel is planning to extend its counterattack to a ground invasion of Gaza. This is the most rapid reservists call up in Israel‚Äôs history.

Presently, the Israelis have amassed at least 100,000 troops around the Gaza Strip, and have engaged in an aerial bombardment of the coastal region for nearly two days. Following exchanges of artillery fire just this morning, Hezbollah terrorists infiltrated Northern Israel. Following reports that Iran was behind the October 7th Massacre, Jerusalem has also mobilized significant numbers of troops along its Syrian and Lebanese borders, should the Iran-backed terrorist army decide to open up a second front against the Jewish state.

I want to be clear, Israel will do whatever it deems necessary to protect its people, and we will vigorously stand with Israel. The world is different today than it was before this weekend‚Äôs massacre. No longer is the distinction between good and evil so easily blurred by Anti-Israel sympathizers in the media. A very clear line has been drawn in the sand, and everyone, both individuals and nations, must choose between Israel and the madness of terrorism.

Tamar Greene recalled that at the time the attack started, she and Aaron were separated from each other, following tradition of the bride and groom not seeing each other the week before the wedding.

""We just had to cancel everything, cancel all the celebrations, and were constantly running back and forth into the bomb shelter.""

The start of the conflict was especially worrisome for the couple because Aaron Greene is also a reservist with the Israel Defense Forces. Aaron Greene, a paratrooper, said he first watched as his friends got called into duty, and then received the call to serve himself.

instagram,"Israeli troops are massing for what‚Äôs widely seen as all but inevitable: a ground invasion of Gaza.

The public and the national security establishment in Israel are demanding retribution for the attacks by Hamas militants that claimed more than 1,000 Israeli lives over the weekend. But a ground invasion would be complicated by Gaza‚Äôs dense population, its complex underground network of tunnels and the danger it would pose to Israelis, Americans and others being held hostage.

An invasion would bring heavy casualties on both sides and questions about whether Israel can devise an exit strategy for the conflict. It would also create ripple effects through the Middle East, increasing the risks that the conflict spirals into a broader regional war. Tap the link in our bio for analysis of how such an operation would play out.

Slides and text by #ValarieKaur

I believe our most powerful response to the horror in Israel and Palestine is to refuse to surrender our humanity.

This is demanding labor. But once your eyes are open ‚Äî you can never again explain away the deaths of children again, like so many are doing right now.

And so:

I stand with the Palestinian people. I stand against the brutal occupation of Palestine and the ongoing subjugation, assaults, and killings of Palestinian people.

I stand against the ongoing antisemitic violence and persecution of Jews, past and present, including the vicious antisemitic attacks right now in the United States.

I have been mourning with Jewish friends who have family in Israel hiding in bomb shelters. And I have been mourning with Palestinian friends whose family in Gaza have no shelters to hide in at all.

My mourning transcends political agendas. Your mourning can too. This is not about equivalency. The time has come to center the human cost of the conflict above all.

Can we stretch our hearts beyond what was previously imaginable? We must if there is to be a world.

instagram,"The escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas militants is raising concerns in the Pentagon about the potential for new Iran attacks on American troops stationed in the Middle East, according to Defense Department officials.

They‚Äôre specifically worried that Iranian proxy groups in Iraq and Syria, or Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, could take advantage of the instability in the region to attack American or partner forces operating in those countries ‚Äì as they‚Äôve done in the past, two DoD officials said.

‚ÄúThat presents an opportunity,‚Äù said one of the officials, who like others interviewed for this story, was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive operations matters.

The potential for escalation is especially high as Israel weighs launching a ground invasion of Gaza in addition to airstrikes on the Palestinian exclave. While the White House has no plans to put American boots on the ground, Biden strongly condemned the Hamas attacks and said it would send additional aid to Israel.

Pentagon officials wouldn‚Äôt say whether any more steps had been taken to protect American forces in Iraq and Syria, citing operational security.

But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did order the deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean and more fighter aircraft to the Middle East in response to the attack on Israel, and is weighing sending a second carrier to the area. Those forces could be used to respond to any Iranian or proxy attacks on American troops.

Those attacks have ceased in recent months, but those forces are already on heightened alert as they navigate Turkish airstrikes on the Syrian Democratic Forces. The group, which Turkey views as terrorists, is made up of Syrian Kurdish militia members who partners with U.S. forces in the counter-ISIS fight.

instagram,"More than 1,200 Israelis have been killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict, an Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson said Wednesday, up from 1,000 previously reported.

‚ÄúThe death toll is a staggering 1,200 dead Israelis,‚Äù IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said in a video message, adding that ‚Äúthe overwhelming majority of them‚Äù were civilians.

Residents of the Gaza Strip scrambled to find safety Wednesday, as Israeli warplanes hammered neighborhood after neighborhood in the tiny coastal enclave, retaliating for weekend attack by Hamas militants.

As Gazans crowded into U.N. schools and a shrinking number of safe neighborhoods, humanitarian groups pleaded for the creation of corridors to get aid into Gaza, warning that hospitals overwhelmed with wounded people were running out of supplies.

instagram,"TW: sexual assault and rape. In the 1970s, the world and the United States stood by and watched while pakistani govt/military employed systematic rape of 200,000+ Bengali women and girls. (in addition to the indiscriminate murdering of any adolescent+ boys). the Pakistani govt justified the rape orders as a religious exception, claiming that the victims would be Hindu, and that they are a deserving victim of violence. 80 percent of Bengali rape victims were actually indeed Muslim‚Äînot that it matters as  to why they met such a violent fate. women and girls post puberty were kept in rape camps. Intl planned parenthood eventually stepped in to help carry out abortions and any medical attention victims needed, but many died in the camps. And the US stood by as one of Pakistan‚Äôs strongest allies until Bangladesh finally gained freedom and independence. the US was of the last nations to recognize Bangladesh‚Äôs independence‚Äîall in the name of opposing the Soviet Union (who allied with India/supported Bangladesh) . do not for a second believe that US support of a nation in any ethnic conflict reflects a desire to uphold human rights or denounce inhumane violence. 

violence against innocent people comes in all shapes and sizes. loudly partake in grieving the deaths of innocents from this week‚Äôs attack on Israeli civilians, the disproportionate violence back on Palestinian civilians, and every event since 1948, when Palestinians began to face systematic violence in every textbook definition of ethnic cleansing. I recommend studying at least two other ethno conflicts (South African Apartheid and Bangladesh Liberation War) while you brush up on the history of state and terrorist violence in Palestinian territories. or else the US media, the same one that called Nelson Mandela (and many other freedom fighters) a terrorist, will simply shape your empathy into their geopolitical interests.

Critical detail: pakistan‚Äôs genocidal violence against Bengalis occurred just a few short decades after Pakistanis were killed, brutalized, and victims of horrific war violence themselves by Indian forces (vice versa).

So tonight over dinner, we had a twenty minute lesson in war. We explained World War 2 (which he knows about) and we explained Israel, and Palestine, and fighting, and feelings. And anger. And conflict. 

When we got to the end, we asked him: if you were standing in a field with all these people fighting each other and you could tell them one thing, what would you tell them? 

Ash thought about this. 

‚ÄúI would tell them to talk it out.‚Äù

Oh, my child. 

We ended the exercise with a resolution to send our bedtime good wishes to everyone in pain tonight. Good wishes to everyone who is suffering. Good wishes to everyone who has family/wh√§nau who may be in danger.

instagram,"What's left of the Trust and Safety team at Twitter (we don't call it X) certainly has their work cut out for them this week. On Monday night, they issued a statement saying: ""As the events continue to unfold rapidly, a cross-company leadership group has assessed this moment as a crisis requiring the highest level of response."" 

This statement does not appear to have reached Twitter's owner, Elon Musk, who has spent the week spreading disinformation about the conflict, conversing with a known QAnon promoter, and boosting anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. Unfortunately, he's far from alone. 

Disinformation about the conflict in the Middle East continues to rage on the platform, driven primarily by verified accounts whose posts are given priority in search results and newsfeeds over other users. 

To read more about why working at Twitter (we're not going to call it X, so just drop it) is still one of the worst gigs in the business tap the üîó in our bio.

La guerra y la violencia no dejan ganadores, solo dolor y sufrimiento a ambos lados. Debemos recordar que todos somos hermanos, hijos del mismo Dios. Como dijo Mahatma Gandhi, ""La no violencia es el arma de los valientes"". 

Oremos para que el odio y el miedo sean reemplazados por empat√≠a y entendimiento mutuo. Pidamos porque los l√≠deres encuentren soluciones pac√≠ficas basadas en la justicia y el respeto. Sembremos semillas de esperanza, para que broten relaciones de armon√≠a y fraternidad. 

Juntos podemos guiar este conflicto hacia la reconciliaci√≥n. Abramos nuestros corazones al amor de Dios y dejemos que su luz ilumine el camino de paz en Medio Oriente.

‚Äî‚Äî

Brothers and sisters, amidst the violence we are witnessing once again in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I make a call from the depths of my heart to illuminate this situation with peace and love. 

War and violence leave no winners, only pain and suffering on both sides. We must remember that we are all brothers and sisters, children of the same God. As Mahatma Gandhi said, ""Nonviolence is the weapon of the brave.""

Let us pray that hatred and fear may be replaced by empathy and mutual understanding. Let us ask that leaders find peaceful solutions based on justice and respect. Let us sow seeds of hope, so that relationships of harmony and fraternity may blossom.

Together we can guide this conflict towards reconciliation. Let us open our hearts to God's love and let His light illuminate the path of peace in the Middle East.

‚Å†
The horrendous terror attack launched from Gaza by Hamas has prompted just such unity in a country that had been divided for months by the judicial reforms of Binyamin Netanyahu‚Äôs right-wing government.‚Å†
‚Å†
On Wednesday Mr Netanyahu agreed to form an emergency war cabinet with Benny Gantz, the leader of the second-largest opposition party. ‚Å†
‚Å†
As a former defence minister and commander of Israel‚Äôs armed forces, Mr Gantz will give heft to a government that has few ministers with experience of this kind of conflict. ‚Å†

instagram,"#IsraelPalestineWar | The death toll in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has crossed 2,100 with the majority of the fatalities being on the Israeli side from the surprise attack of the militia on Saturday.

According to Israeli media, the death toll crossed 1,200 on Tuesday with close to 3,000 injured and the fate of an estimated 150 people abducted and taken to the Gaza Strip still unclear.

The death toll hit a grim 1,000 late Tuesday and the number climbed to 1,200 by Wednesday morning. The Health Ministry in the Hamas-run coastal enclave has claimed that the total number of deaths due to Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip reached 900, while 4,500 others were injured, including 15 paramedics and 20 journalists.

It also said the fatalities include 260 children and 230 women, as well as 22 families who were killed in their entirety. On Tuesday, the IDF had claimed that it had recovered around bodies of around 1,500 Hamas gunmen who had infiltrated into Israeli territory.

Meanwhile, Israel which declared war on Saturday continued with its aerial attacks across Gaza, turning parts of the Hamas-controlled area into a pile of rubble.

The worst hit has been Gaza City's upscale Rimal neighborhood, which is home to shopping malls, restaurants, residential buildings, offices and home to Hamas government ministries.

The Israeli military's Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said that Israel was trying to ‚Äúevacuate civilian populations from areas where Hamas has a military presence‚Äù before unleashing ‚Äúpowerful destruction,"" which Gaza residents say is untrue. 

Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday said the IDF is moving to ""full offence"" against Hamas targets.

""I have released all the restraints. We have [regained] control of the area and we are moving to a full offence,"" he said in an address to troops deployed along the Gaza border.

Meanwhile, the aircraft carrying US arms to Israel has reportedly landed in the country. The IDF did not specify what kind of armaments or equipment it got from the US, which had reaffirmed its support for Israel and the country's right to defend itself.",,4989,"{'like_count': 4939, 'comment_count': 50, 'num_users': 783490}",Indiatimes,,2023-10-11 06:32:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/370572795_289657980337985_3572264800135278624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=L3zIpLG0fIYAX9vxNfY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAFMA5_YaL8ry2cr4nUwUFbJ7y6wn8sLSjnNDA_oBUPiA&oe=655ADEE1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyP6K_aK6lr/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/387185828_655542230016707_5748555213552021274_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=OgFsDt4Bwh8AX9EYjC9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAvI5DudRyHJbjcBbi7gpnCRA8KVQvi_J2JLEdKcoPIjw&oe=65524B9A

Her aim is to EMPOWER women by explaining the biological changes that take place each month and throughout a woman‚Äôs life, She believes that, armed with that knowledge, they can IMPROVE their health, happiness and relationships.

During this INCREDIBLE episode, we discuss:

üëâüèæ Whether weight gain is inevitable as we age. Is it our fate ‚Äì and particularly a woman‚Äôs fate ‚Äì to gain weight once she hits 40?

üëâüèæ How to adjust when and what you eat during different phases of your cycle and the importance of gut health when thinking about hormonal health.

üëâüèæ Why women often handle stress in a different way than men, the impact that hormonal changes can have on brain function and the best times in a woman‚Äôs cycle to resolve conflict and deal with relationship issues.

üëâüèæ Why declining levels of progesterone (the calming hormone) can result in lower-quality sleep and the practical steps we can ALL take to improve our sleep

And so MUCH more!

The Israeli military has been engaged in clashes with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the past four days. On Wednesday, Israel had said that a ‚Äúhostile aircraft‚Äù crossed its northern frontier from Lebanon and sounded alert over the infiltration. However, soon after, the Israel Defense Forces said that the alert issued was ""false"".

instagram,"A total of 192 Korean nationals returned home early Wednesday from Israel, where tensions are escalating amid an armed conflict between the Jewish state and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.

A Korean Air plane carrying them arrived at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, at 6:08 a.m., after departing from Tel Aviv at 1:45 p.m. the previous day (local time).

It is the first flight that has brought Koreans back home since the conflict erupted Saturday when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel.

The airport was crowded with family members anxiously waiting for their loved ones to come home. Many of the travelers are known to have been visiting Israel on a pilgrimage.

Girls have the right to a safe, educated, and healthy life. If effectively supported and educated, girls have the potential to change the world. Investing in realising girls' power upholds their rights today and promises a more equitable and prosperous future. One in which half of humanity is an equal partner in solving the problems of climate change, political conflict, economic growth, disease prevention, and global sustainability.

To achieve #GenderEquality in education across the globe, we must sustain our efforts, equipping girls with tools and fostering environments conducive to their success.

On this International Day of the Girl Child and every day, join UNESCO in celebrating, championing and accompanying girls on their journey.

The situation with the 175 and MTU is getting complicated causing extreme uncertainty and unknowns to the world tour schedule.  As of today, we have decided to deploy the workhorse BCS150 back into the world tour schedule.  She has about 5 weeks of work to be ready, as well as the L&H 33 that was beat up pretty bad earlier this year in Brazil, lots of damage from running her hard.  Actually we ran that 33 2600nm miles on plane in 15-25 knot seas, not counting the trolling miles.  Even the tower legs are cracked and need welding.  She will be made to be better than before and with her Simrad SY50 sonar tuned up, plus installing a Starlink so we may broadcast live from Ascensions to you devoted and crazy followers.  Will do the South Atlantic run Jan to April on the 150/33, then reevaluate based on the status of the 175 at that time.  Given the conflict with Israel, the option of the 175 heading to the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean is no longer possible.  We‚Äôll focus on South Atlantic with the 150/33 January to April, worry about the rest of the year later.  Buy Advil stocks as we‚Äôll be consuming plenty as Old Company runs around on a 33 footer again.  Can‚Äôt wait!!!

I REFUSE to be manipulated into a war. I am ALWAYS anti-innocent deaths. I am ALWAYS anti-terrorist. And I am ALWAYS anti-globalist elite agenda. Propaganda all around right now. Please take a second to step back & evaluate things objectively. Stop trying to force everyone into boxes like this is BLM in 2020. There is a lot more going on than most people realize. Who owns Israel? Who comprises the Synagogue of Satan? Why is this being MASS blasted to the public while atrocities & ethnic cleansings with a much greater death toll are ignored by the media? If you can‚Äôt answer those questions I would recommend spending time researching instead of posting about a conflict you know very little about.

instagram,"I‚Äôm so thrilled to share the stunning UK cover of DARK STAR BURNING, ASH FALLS WHITE! We‚Äôre meeting some new demons, stepping into one of my favorite magical settings in the duology as well as introducing a most fun and chaotic key character ‚ú® STAR is up for preorder at Waterstones ‚Äî link in my bio! Thank you so much @diamonster09 for bringing my story to life ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
If you haven‚Äôt read the Song of the Last Kingdom duology, it has:
‚ú® ancient Chinese history and mythology
‚ú® demon gods, monsters, spirits and ghosts
‚ú® a star-crossed love
‚ú® intertwined destinies
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
ùó¶ùòÜùóªùóºùóΩùòÄùó∂ùòÄ:
The Demon Gods have risen.
Skies‚Äô End has fallen.
And Lan and Zen have chosen sides.
But they will not fight together.
 
Lan has inherited the power of the Silver Dragon, and she believes the Demon Gods to be the cause of war, conflict, and turmoil. To save her kingdom and her people, Lan will need to find the only mythical weapon capable of destroying the Demon Gods: the Godslayer.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Zen is sure that the only way to free the Last Kingdom is to use the power of the Demon Gods. When he bound the Black Tortoise, he paid the ultimate price: to inherit its strength, he will forfeit his body, his mind, and his soul.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
At the centre of both Lan‚Äôs and Zen‚Äôs journeys is one city: Shaklahira, a former stronghold of the Imperial Court that vanished without a trace when the Elantians invaded. Its location is a mystery, and both are sure that it holds the answers they need.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
To win the war, Lan will have to decide: Can she face the boy she loves again? And when she does, can she kill him to free her people?

instagram,"UNITY GOVERNMENT

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz have formed a temporary unity government and war-time cabinet to focus on the fight ahead with Hamas. 

The new emergency government brings two opposition leaders - both former Army leaders - and greater military know-how into the decision making process.  Proponents hope the temporary alliance will add legitimacy to the leadership‚Äôs choices.

Among the decisions they confront: will Israel send ground troops into Gaza to attempt to rescue hostages? Or is this a trap that will only lead to more slaughter and suffering and escalate the war? They‚Äôll also confront the challenges posed by increased fighting with Hezbollah to the North and the possibility of armed conflict from the West Bank and even Syria.

The emergency wartime government will focus only on decisions related to the conflict. 

Netanyahu has agreed that he will not pursue highly controversial domestic ‚Äújudicial reforms‚Äù while the war is ongoing. All year Israel has been been rocked by protests against the policies of Netanyahu‚Äôs unpopular far right government. 

To our American audience and those not familiar: Israel has a parliamentary system with more than two dominant political parties. Israeli politicians are experienced in governing together. They are now choosing a ‚Äúpower sharing‚Äù arrangement. Think of this as broadly akin to Democrats and Republicans sharing government power and making decisions about war together.",,3778,"{'like_count': 3654, 'comment_count': 124, 'num_users': 662210}",Jessica Yellin,,2023-10-11 20:03:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/240411475_215799307070159_4416728062049731685_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fWULtEcN4PgAX87FHZj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDZVbJcidUZJ9aBslevulYUzN7uKrTMvmrN2Q920YqlTg&oe=6559B896,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRXDKzv66b/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387745239_370682538631087_337085112728394369_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AFnjqQKVGFYAX_kXm0b&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBQ9e9sV7raP1noUXDuL3PjMuErpgaKUQ4_N25FDdU9HA&oe=654A9AE9

Known for her performances in TV show 'Naagin', Naik took to Instagram on Sunday (October 8) to revealed that the duo were killed right in front of their children in Israel.

Sharing the pictures of her sister and brother-in-law, the actress wrote, ""Odaya, my sister and her husband were brutally murdered by Palestinian terrorist in front of their children, was found dead today (Sunday).""

""Deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our beloved cousin in the terror attack. Her warmth, kindness, and love will always be remembered. Our thoughts and prayers are with her and all the victims. May they rest in peace,"" she wrote.

""Please stand with us and the people of Israel in this time of difficulty. It‚Äôs time people see the reality of these terrorists and how inhumane they can be. Deeply heartbroken,"" she added.

In another post on Tuesday (October 10), the actress said that she has been at the receiving end on the internet for sharing the update as she received a lot of hate and she is being shamed, humiliated, and targeted for being Jewish. 

‚ÄúThe grief and the emotions that I and my family face today cannot be spoken in words. As of today, Israel is in pain. Her children, her women, and her streets are burning in the flames, in the wrath of Hamas. Women, children, the old, and the weak are being targeted,‚Äù Madhura Naik said in the video posted on Tuesday.

About Israel-Gaza Conflict:

Israel and Gaza reel under relentless violence in the wake of Israel's war with Hamas. The conflict started on Saturday (October 7) after the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas attacked parts of Israel in a surprise move. Hamas fired rockets into Israel and its fighters sneaked across the border, abducting and killing Israeli civilians. The two sides have been engaged in fierce clashes ever since in several sites inside Israel. On october 8, Israel declared war against Hamas.

Heart-wrenching visuals and pictures of the attacks are floating on social media.",,3444,"{'like_count': 3404, 'comment_count': 40, 'num_users': 153511}",The Guwahati Times,,2023-10-11 07:33:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/49696398_2021524361234107_626581182401740800_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pmVtiwfsRhsAX_LbM60&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBJcyDzz3HGiRTFxLtfiatLF4iINrRDMRogKHTFkViOEw&oe=655A1DDD,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyQBMFAP-Bj/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387269956_648776403912208_7706889249752886106_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=uqfNIHxrEu8AX8FbNKC&_nc_oc=AQlp5j3yGSdwToia9EU46UpEI6A8NO5kTCsnTU3Zd-E8XkKE33e1nUIKc1r4MxpYhOA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfArL4qeSh2yxbI3VxFD4ZvtIDfsN53fPWCrk94siEOgtQ&oe=6531FA73

instagram,"Recently a misleading photograph of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sending his son Avner Netanyahu to serve the country has gone viral on X, formerly Twitter. Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, users praised the Israeli PM's son's patriotism as the 'picture of the day'.

 However, the whole situation was misunderstood as the photograph is from 1st December 2014, when Avner began his military service in the Israel Defence Forces. As of right now, Avner's military service during the war has not been formally confirmed. According to reports, the most recent battle between Israel and Palestine claimed the lives of around 2,000 Palestinians.

 The deadly all-out onslaught against Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023, caused Israel to proclaim ""a state of war"" and unleash retaliatory bombings. This marked the beginning of the intense conflict.

 Former Indian Ambassador and diplomat Navtej Sarna acknowledged the potential for the conflict to extend beyond Israel and Gaza, citing the presence of militant groups like Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and potential unrest in the West Bank and Syria. 

 He predicted that the conflict's duration would depend on Israel's response and Hamas supporters' reactions. Although international pressure may lead to negotiations, the immediate future is expected to involve intense military action and retaliation.

instagram,"Finding the calm within the chaos ‚ú®

We all prefer when things are working in a favour, but on essential part of life mastery is learning to ride the storm is staying calm and anchored amidst the chaos. When life disrupts our peace of mind and presents us with challenges, as it inevitably will, there is always a tendency to turn our backs in resistance. Fear, pain, loss and grief or unpleasant trees that nobody wants to feel, so rather than face the stress and anxiety play my calls, we often push them away in the hopes they will disappear. The problem is that when we resist, we come into conflict with our present moment reality and we actually give these feelings power.

The road to peace as such begins when we can face these feelings, allowing them to rise and fall, to come and go, or without the need to control. If we can approach them, even in the most difficult of circumstances, with a willingness to be with our experience, in total acceptance of what is, we open a possibility of landing peacefully in the present moment of our lives. In other words, we must continue to weave with patients and resilience trusting in the bigger picture.

instagram,"Imagine a world where one in five girls does not have access to a quality education.

This isn't a dystopian novel. This is reality.

Across the globe, twenty percent of girls are denied the basic right to learn, to grow, to dream.

In developing countries, two-thirds of illiterate youth are girls. Two-thirds. Picture the dreams that go unfulfilled, the potential that goes untapped, simply because they lack the opportunity to read and write.

In conflict zones, girls are two and a half times more likely to be out of school than boys.

The bullet of war doesn't only shatter homes; it shatters futures.

It shatters the dreams of girls who could become scientists, artists, leaders.

But the story doesn't end there. It's not just about the statistics. It's about the spirit. The spirit of every girl who has ever dared to dream.

Despite these odds, girls around the world are standing up, speaking out, and sparking change.

They are becoming the first in their families to graduate high school or college.

They are leading their communities towards a brighter future.

They are proving that when you invest in a girl's education, you invest in a nation's future.

The world is full of girls with dreams as vast as the sky and potential as deep as the ocean.

They are not just statistics.

They are stories of resilience, of hope, of power.

They are the promise of a brighter tomorrow.

So today, on this International Day of the Girl, remember this: Every girl holds the power to shape the world. Every girl is a beacon of hope. Every girl is a testament to the indomitable spirit of humankind.

Because every girl, no matter where she comes from, no matter what circumstances she is born into, has the potential to rise. To soar. To shatter the glass ceilings that have been placed above her.

Every girl has the power to change the world. And that is a story worth telling.

instagram,"Let‚Äôs check out some evidence-free claims about the Israel-Palestine conflict which went around the world before being verified. Five large UK papers went with the story of 40 Israeli babies being beheaded. Obviously, killing infants with such a gruesome method will elicit a strong emotional response from most. And one is likely to condemn anyone responsible for such a horror. Just 1 little problem. 

This story came from an Israeli TV news outlet named i24. Reporter Nicole Zedek claimed that she had seen decapitated babies herself, though none were shown on camera as she toured an area which was attacked by Hamas. Then she changed her story and claimed it was hearsay from Israeli soldiers. When pressed by Turkish news agency Andalou, the Israeli forces could not confirm it. Now Zedek has retracted her statement and is now saying the death toll is ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù CNN‚Äôs Abby D. Phillip, Fox News, the LA Times, and many pro-Israel voices repeated this claim uncritically, with zero evidence. Normally, a respected news source will cross-check its sources rather than just repeat hearsay. But this is how propaganda works‚Äîthey craft your thoughts for you knowing that most won‚Äôt bother digging. Most will accept an unfounded accusation like this simply because they want to believe it‚Äôs true, and because it portrays Israel as a victim, and Hamas as the aggressor. So were any babies beheaded? No evidence currently supports such a claim. 

Then we have the story of Shani Louk, a German tourist who attended a rave which was targeted by Hamas. The BBC wrote: ‚ÄúA German mother is pleading for information about her daughter, who she believes was kidnapped by Palestinian militants at a music festival in Israel and paraded through the streets in the back of a pick-up truck.‚Äù

Your white supremacy is at the root of you being able to bury your head in the sand while justifying decades of death, violence, occupation, and apartheid. 

Your racism makes you comfortable calling a genocide a conflict. 

Your racism and privilege give you the audacity to say which acts of resistance is acceptable for the oppressed.

instagram,"This is a long and complicated conflict that literally goes back thousands of years. Yes, the attacks can easily be explained as terrorist attacks (some are saying it‚Äôs comparable to our country‚Äôs 9/11). Heartbreaking, senseless. But the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is not simply explained in a word or two. It is one of the most written about conflicts in history and one of the most heated debates of our time. 

We are not experts on the Middle East. So if we didn‚Äôt explain something in a way you would have, or we used a word or phrase in a way you don‚Äôt agree with, please know it was unintentional. We also may have left something out you thought should be included. Social media doesn‚Äôt allow us the space to include everything. We are always learning and open to learning more. This topic is so heated it will be impossible to please everyone. So we offer our apologies in advance. 

Also, it is worth noting that not all Palestinians support Hamas. There have been a significant amount of casualties in Gaza as well, over 1,000 killed and over 5,000 injured. 

For more context as to the WHY, we strongly encourage you to listen to @wiserworldpodcast ALL three episodes. She does a thorough job of starting at the beginning of the thousands year history.

Being an ally to Jews looks the same as being an ally to any other marginalized group. No one is asking you to make a political statement about the I/P conflict. This is not about politics. This is about letting the world know that attacks on Jews are never okay. This is about calling out people spreading hate and those who seek our destruction.

Are people more afraid to lose followers than to speak up for Jews? Hatred for Jewish people is spreading globally and we NEED you to care. 

‚ÄúThere comes a time when silence is betrayal.‚Äù - Martin Luther King Jr. 

Showing your support in these ways doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt care about the suffering of the Palestinian civilians affected. I pray for an end to this violence and peace for all of our peoples.

Gaza a 'massacre'
Turkish President, Tayyip Erdogan, said that Israel's blockade and bombing of Gaza in retaliation for Palestinian Resistance fighters infiltrating the area around Gaza as a disproportionate response amounting to a ""massacre""
Speaking to his ruling AK Party in Parliament, Erdogan said even war had a ""morality"" but the flare-up since the weekend had ""very severely"" violated that.

When you‚Äôre stretched too thin, things you used to do with ease, may feel impossible.  This can be a sign of burnout. 

Burnout is the combination of overwhelming exhaustion, emotional distancing, and a sense of ineffectiveness as a parent that results from chronic parenting stress.

If you‚Äôre burned out, you might also experience ‚§µÔ∏è

üëâ A consistent bad mood
üëâ Feeling ‚Äútouched out‚Äù
üëâ Difficulty thinking clearly
üëâ Loss of pleasure in parenting
üëâ Declining physical health
üëâ Quickness to anger
üëâ Forgetting important appointments 

These are just a few examples.  In later stages of burnout, your experience may worsen and take the form of a sleep disorder, chronic physical health problems, increased addictive behavior, conflict in your relationship, and more.

Comment BURNOUT below and I‚Äôll send you a short quiz to find out if you‚Äôre at risk for parental burnout and what you can do to get the support you need ‚ù§Ô∏è

To let the body feel somatic empathy for another and then pendulate back to our actual environments not only keeps grounded but allows us to be more useful because we have more capacity.‚Å†

We can pretty much expect there to be no shortage of pain, conflict, and terror in this world.‚Å†

We can also expect there to be no shortage of beauty, pleasure, and love.‚Å†

Can we orient to both?‚Å†

Can we be this ambiguous as a species and as a being so that we can become flexible in relationship & in response to the highly sensational world around us?‚Å†

instagram,"MATW has been on the ground working in Palestine and Gaza providing emergency relief and rebuilding homes. 

Our MATW team works tirelessly to ensure humanitarian aid is delivered to those who are most vulnerable including women, children and the elderly. 

We work closely with local suppliers in Palestine ensuring essentials such as *food items, meals, medical kits, mattresses, blankets and more* are secured and maintained so that our teams are constantly ready to deliver aid - especially in times of crisis when the cost of these items are inflated, making them beyond reach for those we serve. 

The blockade further inflates prices in the region, hence the rising costs of living for locals affected, and the need for able brothers and sisters (our generous donors) to contribute to ensure the delivery of these basic necessities. 

Our primary focus will be to ensure that we reach the most vulnerable people affected with life‚Äôs most basic necessities to combat hunger and suffering in times of disaster and conflict. 

For ‚Äúwhoever saves a life, it‚Äôs as if they‚Äôve saved all of mankind‚Äù.

instagram,"Dehumanization is the negating of a person's individual humanity and the cruelty that accompanies it. It‚Äôs a psychological process of demonizing people, seeing them as less than human and, hence, not worthy of humane treatment.

This method reverses our instincts: harming others goes against our soul-level inclinations as there are very deep inhibitions that prevent us from treating others like sub-human; dehumanization is aimed at subverting those inhibitions.

Throughout history, this technique has been deliberately exploited by structures of darkness to distract, sow division, push concealed agendas, increase power and justify acts of violence, slavery, and the violation of basic human rights. When successful, it creates moral exclusion of groups that are targeted based on their identity‚Äîe.g., religious beliefs, nationality, gender, race, ethnicity, medical status‚Äîand depicted as ‚Äúless than,‚Äù criminal or even evil. 

The ‚Äúothering‚Äù scheme always starts with identifying an enemy and creating an ‚Äúus vs. them‚Äù dynamic, where innocent people become pawns and victims. As we take sides, lose trust, and get angrier and angrier, we not only solidify an idea of the other as separate, but also start to lose our ability to listen, communicate, and even practice the slightest of empathy. Language and imagery are crucial for achieving the dehumanizing goal (e.g., in Rwanda, Hutus called Tutsis cockroaches). Once we see people ‚Äúon the other side‚Äù as morally inferior and even dangerous, the conflict is then framed as good versus evil. When this framework has been established, positions become more rigid as we are lead to believe that we must either destroy ‚Äúothers‚Äù or be destroyed ourselves. The dehumanizing aim has then been achieved.

Now more than ever we need to acknowledge that we‚Äôre all vulnerable to the slow, insidious and manipulative psychological weapon of dehumanization. Only by acknowledging this and searching for compassion and healing within our hearts we can avoid falling into this trap and prevent history from repeating itself in a never-ending cycle of darkness.

War dehumanizes. And dehumanization leads to war. We will never normalize any of the two.",,2431,"{'like_count': 2345, 'comment_count': 86, 'num_users': 59917}",Souls of a Movement,,2023-10-11 18:10:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/129137894_123485792796561_318204004355118423_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=gHo581JV8ksAX_9S2SP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBx69BszZIn7MGqtXimJFB9rYL5K9J4RmlANGlByjn05w&oe=655A6086,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRKHv8tEdz/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391180562_1385614272382892_4330611550531758072_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=hvwcN2Kjw5sAX9raWin&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC0SuFoXmFthvaoaTLm6tBkkLJN6eQ4qKNPNUCpfHOXaQ&oe=655ACA8A

Palestinian liberation & Black liberation are inextricably linked. please keep in mind that those who condemn a people justified in their freedom cries, are people who wouldn‚Äôt shed a tear for you.

it‚Äôs been high time for all of us to re-examine & reassess our relationships to & with people & entities we love because those who have refused to take this stance have no less than positioned themselves as our collective opposition. 

that said, I am deeply and forever grateful to & love my Jewish anti-Zionist homies who educated me sooo so many years ago about the plight of the Palestinian people and their ongoing resistance to Isr*eli occupation. cus school definitely didn‚Äôt do it. a reminder that we learn in community. that we all we got. so let‚Äôs show them that our Palestinian sibs got us moving in solidarity with them.

I implore us not to feed into the propaganda that anti-zionism is anti-Judaism or fall prey to the weaponization of trauma as justification to violate, incarcerate and exterminate an entire population.

this is not a conflict.
there are no both sides.
instead, we are witnessing the spawn of the U.S. imperialist war machine‚Äîthe  zi*nist regime‚Äîcommit Palestinian genocide ON OUR DIME in real time.

instagram,"Edik walked 12 miles to stop and fill up his fuel cans before leaving Nagorno-Karabakh. But in a horrific explosion at the gas station, hundreds of Armenians were burned, including Edik.

The blast had left Edik with burns over 40 percent of his body and with deep burn wounds to his face, back, and limbs. His legs and hands took the brunt.

While trying to get back to his family, he fought the almost-constant urge to give in to the shock his body was experiencing as it reacted to the life-threatening injuries. 

Edik along with more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians have fled Nagorno-Karabakh since this latest escalation of conflict. In response to the great needs, our team has airlifted 30+ tons of relief supplies and sent burn specialists to help meet critical needs as we work alongside local church partners and hospitals.

‚ÄúThe depth and extent of these are probably some of the worst I‚Äôve seen in my 27 years of experience working in burn treatment. The amount of suffering here is beyond human comprehension,‚Äù said Joany, a nurse on our Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART).

Since the beginning of our response, our specialists have treated several dozen burn victims with wound care and skin grafts, and, in the most severe cases, with post-operative physical therapy.

Jessica uses her physical therapy skills to strategically mobilize patients to help strengthen their bodies and prevent further injuries. For some, that means sitting up on their own. For others, it is learning to walk again.

In the few days that Edik has worked with Jessica, his outlook has brightened. Even as tears streamed down one cheek, he began to smile. 

‚ÄúTwo days ago, I was so depressed that I thought I would never come out of this hospital,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut because of Jessica, I have hope. Her positivity brought a lot of change in this hospital. I‚Äôm very grateful for her. When she comes here, it gives us hope.‚Äù",,2209,"{'like_count': 2176, 'comment_count': 33, 'num_users': 220129}",Samaritan's Purse,,2023-10-11 19:09:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/89261971_243060913373503_4086529432158732288_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=P9LuYVW5Lu8AX-jhxL7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAy1Vqr4frga1SYXVP-hSWpa3xOxHajF3lySpek0p7rIA&oe=655B72DE,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRQ0fUg-5j/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/387675166_591899749652680_7705682856967687115_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=-rKx0lpbugMAX8ED_Do&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBnt8lB410tFREXLwKa95iOBg-NRAeqhzrIdGLqOhtZVQ&oe=6544CE7F

Some Muslim and Arab players made it clear in this week‚Äôs meeting, held on Monday, that they would walk off the pitch ahead of upcoming fixtures for their club sides if respect is not shown for Palestinians lost in the conflict. 

A source acting as a Muslim and Arab spokesman said: ‚ÄúOver 950 people died in Gaza and 1000 people died in Israel. Every single civilian life is a tragedy and must be mourned. Why would we have a minute‚Äôs silence for the Israelis but not the Palestinian people who are also suffering? None of the players are against a minute's silence for the victims of war.

instagram,"In a world where empathy is most needed and compassion should be celebrated, it is disheartening to witness the depths humanity has sunk to when people resort to bullying those who dare to show compassion for those affected by harrowing atrocities. It is a somber realization that we have reached an all-time low, where kindness is met with cruelty. How is this behaviour supposed to help anyone?

No doubt that there is no equivalent of the tragic atrocities that are occuring in the context of decades of war and conflict, however it is heartbreaking to witness the ripple effect of aggression and cruelty seeping into our communities and expressed through our words and actions and this perpetuation of aggression in our everyday lives will lead to further division and pain.

We will never know the full truth. We will never have access to the ugly political strategies behind the scenes and so when we don't have that intel, we need to focus on what is evident and visible and that's the most grotesque form of human suffering in our recent history. So I will not be part of this cycle of hate, because all lives matter, and I will continue nurturing empathy, for in doing so, we can maybe usher in some light and hope during this horrific time üíîüíî.

‚ÄãDozens of babies were brutally murdered ‚Äî some even decapitated ‚Äî by Hamas terrorists inside a kibbutz in southern Israel during Saturday's shocking assault on Israeli civilians, according to journalists who were let in to see the aftermath of the massacre and corroborated by the Israeli Defense Forces, in the most ghastly war crime committed in the conflict thus far.‚Å†
‚Å†
The bodies of 40 babies were discovered by Israeli soldiers in the Kfar Aza kibbutz, located just outside Gaza, the Israeli-based i24 News reported. In kibbutzim, babies are typically housed together in a single nursery.‚Å†
‚Å†
A spokesperson for the IDF confirmed the reports of beheadings to Insider. It was unclear how many of the bodies had been desecrated, and independent monitors are yet to verify the accounts.‚Å†
‚Å†
""It's hard to even explain exactly the mass casualties that happened right here,"" i24 correspondent Nicole Zedeck reported from Kfar Aza, where she said she spoke to Israeli soldiers who saw the aftermath of the massacre firsthand.‚Å†
‚Å†
Zedeck was part of a contingent of reporters let in by Israeli security forces to view what remained of the kibbutz. A French journalist that was part of that contingent also confirmed that ""infants and children under 2"" had been beheaded, saying she and others saw the images ""with their own eyes.""‚Å†

The University of Michigan community gathered on the Diag Tuesday night for a vigil following the attacks on Israel Saturday. More than 1,000 campus community members attended the event, gathering in support of the lives lost following the attacks. 

On Saturday morning, Hamas troops carried out a planned attack on Israel, first firing rockets into the country and then carrying out attacks by land, sea and air, according to the New York Times. The attack infiltrated 22 cities in Israel and by Sunday morning, officials reported 700 Israelis as dead after the attacks, with an estimated 150 other civilians and soldiers held hostage.

Israel formally declared war against Hamas on Sunday and carried out an air attack on the Gaza Strip neighborhood Tuesday morning. Officials on Tuesday reported over 900 deaths in Gaza and over 1,000 deaths in Israel. The attack targeted buildings and forced Palestinians to find shelter in the 25-mile Gaza Strip, with the war continuing to escalate. The war has claimed the lives of soldiers and civilians on both sides and is the result of over two-centuries of conflict.

Attendees gathered at Hillel Tuesday to walk to the Diag. According to attendees, students, faculty and community members in attendance were escorted by the Ann Arbor Police Department.

Correction: This article has been updated to include the correct number of deaths of soldiers and civilians on both sides as of Wednesday morning. The language of this article has also been updated to reflect the death toll in Gaza and Israel.

Petrol prices across South Australia are set to rise, with some service stations raising their prices to $2.20 a litre. 

The RAA says the rise is a part of Adelaide's typical petrol price cycle and not in response to the ongoing conflict in Israel.

instagram,"I am opposed to plans for a blanket ban on Palestinian Australians gathering in NSW in support of their people. The civilian suffering in the conflict is universal, and we should not have the right to deny Australians the ability to peacefully assemble.

Leaders within the Palestinian community, including religious institutions, need to come out strongly to rebuke calls for violence and condemn the slaughter of innocent civilians by Hamas. The government and police need to work with organizers to prevent the celebration of terrorism against civilians and take direct action against any incitement to violence. Any display of support for terrorism must be dealt with swiftly.

If organizers are unable to do this and are not confident that their presence may not further inflame the situation, they should take matters into their own hands to minimize the damage this will do to their cause publicly in Australia. It is their responsibility, and the rest of the country has every right to judge their actions on the day.

If the ban stays in place and a protest led by the same organizers goes ahead and we see the same scenes as the other night in front of the Opera House but this time with clashes with police, the damage to the perception of Palestinian people in Australia will be immense. 

Australians should always have every right to oppose war and advocate for peace.

instagram,"What happened in the early morning hours Saturday in Israel was one of the most heinous, barbaric, monstrous acts in the history of humanity. The blame lies squarely on HAMAS- that since its  inception has been very clear on its intentions to completely obliterate the state of Israel and its people. Since Hamas overtook control of Gaza in 2006, it has used the Palestinian people as shields, hostages as it continues its campaign against Israel. I‚Äôve been reading so much misinformation and well intentioned yet factually inaccurate comments about the current conflict in Gaza. Greater context is needed so that the world truly understands what‚Äôs going on. This thread by @washingtonpost is so on point in creating a brief synopsis of the timeline that has brought us to this horrific moment. History is IMPORTANT so we‚Äôre not condemned to repeat the tragic mistakes of the past. The stories now coming out of Israel are abhorrent. Make no mistake, this is pure hatred and EVIL fueled by fanatical religious extremism. Hamas is a terrorist organization. Hamas is to blame for the atrocities committed. Every hour things gets clearer and more horrific. My heart is shattered. This is the most sickening display of human on human violence and all in the name of God?! This is blasphemy. This is the opposite of God. May God protect the people and state of Israel and ALL the innocents who have had nothing to do with this conflict but who‚Äôs lives have been and are being devastated.

Despite the ban, Pierre says she will continue to fight, and the work will not stop; she believes that the Canal represents a symbol of resistance to Dominican interference for Haitians.‚Å†

instagram,"I'm going to share an experience that occurred while I was up on the mauna on Indigenous Peoples Day.  Please do not reshare it. As I was driving up, I was pondering about the war that just broke out and thinking about how little I know about either Israel or Palestine or the Gaza Strip except for what I see on social media or what I've seen on Netflix's Fauda. After I gave my offering and was walking back to my car, a woman came up to me and asked if she could go up to the ahu as she wanted to pray for her family in Israel as they had already lost loved ones in the first day and I could see her sadness. I said to her that I'd go up with her and we could pray together for both sides and all of the victims, the families, the people. I expressed to her that the social media from Hawai'i I see is pro Palestinian because of occupation and all she asked me was if I could please learn more, do my research, that the people are good people and I agreed that I would so I'm starting with Who exactly is Hamas because I just watched World News and a Palestinian in Gaza says they themselves have been kept hostage by Hamas all these years and the attacks on Israel have nothing to do with the people and they are dying now as well. This is not a post for any of you to comment on, Im not exacting an opinion, and I'll be doing a lot of reading and watching. I'm just saying that I don't know anything about their history or long standing conflict and I need to learn more, but what I do know is war equals death every time and I'll just be praying for those suffering right now no matter what side they're on. Thankful for the chance encounter which really wasn't a chance meeting after all but instead a teaching moment for me. It just reminds me of how far away from this we live. I'll delete this post if those reading it just skim and give me negative comments. I just wanted to share how little I know and how much I have to learn, that's all.

instagram,"‚ÄúI am the living one. I died, but look‚ÄîI am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and the grave.‚Äù ‚ÄîRevelation 1:18 

When Christ was born in Bethlehem, the angels appeared to some shepherds nearby and said, ‚ÄúGlory to God in highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased‚Äù (Luke 2:14 NLT). Jesus came to bring peace on earth.

The Antichrist, however, will come to take peace from the earth. And here‚Äôs what we need to know: Satan is behind all the wars and struggles on this planet.

We‚Äôre understandably perplexed when we hear about barbaric acts of war and terrorism. The network pundits try to explain it. But the reason people do these horrible things is because there is a devil. And the devil loves violence and war. He loves carnage and death.

We‚Äôve had some massive wars in our world‚Äôs history. There was World War I, which was called the war to end all wars. But it took only twenty years for another conflict to develop, and World War II was far worse, with even more casualties. And the worst wars are yet to come.

Concerning the end of the age, Jesus said, ‚ÄúAnd you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world. But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come‚Äù (Matthew 24:6‚Äì8 NLT).

Here‚Äôs the bottom line: God always has the last word. Sometimes things look bleak, and we have setback after setback. We say, ‚ÄúI thought God‚Äôs Word would prevail.‚Äù It will in time. God will have the last word.

Hospitals will run out of fuel and electricity in 4 days. üíî

The ongoing conflict, political turmoil, and economic hardship have deepened the humanitarian crisis for families and their children.

The innocent people urgently require aid for basic needs like food, clean water, healthcare, and shelter.

Every year, tensions escalate, leading to hundreds of casualties among those with no part in politics.

Donate and send relief to support the innocent lives affected in the Gaza Strip.

Het hijsen van de vlag vanwege het opgelaaide conflict in het Midden-Oosten, leidde tot veel discussie. Met het tonen van de Isra√´lische vlag zou te veel partij voor Isra√´l worden gekozen.

""Wraak helpt niet"", betoogt burgemeester Ahmed Marcouch. Dodelijk geweld brengt volgens hem alleen maar veel meer dodelijk geweld. ""Wij zijn juist op de wereld om elkaar te laten leven, niet om elkaar te doden. Dus moeten wij verbinden, niet polariseren.""

instagram,"""What is Life? It is the flash of a firefly in the night. It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime. It is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset. The True Peace. 
The first peace, which is the most important, is that which comes within the souls of people when they realize their relationship, their oneness, with the universe and all its powers, and when they realize that at the center of the universe dwells Wakan-Taka (the Great Spirit), and that this center is really everywhere, it is within each of us. This is the real peace, and the others are but reflections of this. The second peace is that which is made between two individuals, and the third is that which is made between two nations. 
But above all you should understand that there can never be peace between nations until there is known that true peace, which, as I have often said, is within the souls of men.""

This conflict has been rocket fuel for terrorism and a mechanism for state sponsored terror in the name of Islam for too long. End the endless wars.

instagram,"The last four days have marked a period of mourning for several USC communities as Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that is classified by the United States as a terrorist organization, attacked Israel by land, air and sea Saturday morning.

The violence, which is still ongoing, has escalated to a retaliatory Israeli bombing of Gaza, a densely populated Palestinian territory that has been under Hamas' control since 2007. At the time of publication, the estimated death toll since Saturday on both sides of the border was 2,100.

The Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly held a Dabke Night Monday, USC Hillel and USC Chabad led a vigil Tuesday evening and students spoke about the conflict at the Undergraduate Student Government meeting later that night.

instagram,"What I‚Äôve done this week is consistent with what I‚Äôve done for almost a decade now. 

As a proponent of nonviolence, there were several actions in the heyday of the BLM-era I didn‚Äôt align with (though 97% of demonstrations were nonviolent). I didn‚Äôt take to the internet to tell you where *I* stand because that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs most important to me. It has no bearing on the material conditions of the conflict situation.

I also didn‚Äôt believe that the worst elements of Black resistance characterized the struggle as a whole; if anything, they did point to the severity of the oppression they addressed and the desperation of my people to be free.

Instead of denouncing or condoning ‚Äî again, things that have no meaning from someone like me ‚Äî I tried to offer context, even when people performed actions I thought were ill-advised, unstrategic, or just plain wrong. I also used those as opportunities to confront bad but popular assumptions about social change, from my research.

It isn‚Äôt just recent movements I‚Äôve had to view like this. I have to tell you, I wince at Fanon‚Äôs accounts of decolonial struggles. I want him to be wrong when he says ‚ÄúDecolonization‚Ä¶is clearly an agenda for social disorder.‚Äù I don‚Äôt have much of a stomach to read about slave rebellions where they indiscriminately killed their oppressors and anyone who looked like their oppressors (yes, including women and children). They are things I‚Äôve had to accept as realities of the dynamics and possibilities of armed struggle for freedom. 

To be abundantly clear: I didn‚Äôt respond with this info because innocents were killed in the news. I responded this way because some of you said ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt happen when people are decolonizing.‚Äù But it does happen. It‚Äôs not a justification to state a fact. 

These are not ideals I profess or actions I would perform myself. But I can‚Äôt ignore or erase them. 

As someone interested in freedom, I think it‚Äôs my duty to understand them.

instagram,"The destruction in the last few days, the families broken and homes bombed has to be a wake up call. 

Palestinians have lived under occupation, under these conditions, for decades. Can we acknowledge their continual plight for freedom? For human rights?

Thousands of Israelis have been bullied and beaten for standing shoulder to shoulder with their Palestinian brothers and sisters. 

The brave will never be silenced. 

Media & Politicians in the Middle East, Europe and the US have blood on their hands. The enablers have destroyed a land sacred to all. 

Wherever you stand on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, please, have compassion, always. Only a freak, a psychopath, will get any pleasure seeing a father pleading for the release of his child or a father whispering in the ear of the dead daughter he carries in his arms. 

These images don‚Äôt belong in the 21st Century.

We are better than this.

STAND WITH PEACE
STAND WITH HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL

instagram,"‚ù§Ô∏èSHE MATTERS: GALIT CARBONE!‚ù§Ô∏è

This is 66-year-old Australian citizen Galit Carbone. 
On Saturday, Galit was murdered in Southern Israel during the appalling attack conducted by Hamas militants.
Galit is the 51st Australian woman lost to violence this year.
I‚Äôve tossed and turned since the war broke out about how I would handle the slaughter of Australian women and children in the conflict zone.
The reality is, if Galit was murdered under any other circumstances, I would not hesitate to add her to my count and to the Memorial to Women and Children Lost to Violence and the Australian Femicide Map.
I know some of you will say including the women and children murdered in war zones inflates the death toll and that I should be sticking to women killed on Australian soil. 
But at this juncture I should remind you, I have always documented women and children killed in Australia and Aussie victims killed overseas.
I also document ALL women and children killed regardless of their relationship to the perpetrator or the perpetrator‚Äôs gender. 
In other words, I document victims lost to domestic violence, intimate partner violence, associate violence or stranger violence - that is all forms of violence. 
Galit was a grandmother and mum to three children. She spent time working as a librarian. She was also a much-loved and respected member of the Australian Jewish community. 
Galit was murdered, there is no doubt. 
The circumstances of her death do not render her life and loss less meaningful. 
At the end of the day, Galit‚Äôs existence and her murder matter ‚Äì if not to you, she matters to her loved ones, to her community ‚Äì and to me.
RIP GALIT CARBONE! ‚ù§Ô∏è

instagram,"Some handy hints to help you support your #adhd partner. 

Putting in place a few strategies can help so much

Here's a few of my suggestions:

üíô Working together to achieve things. Be a team. Use each other's strengths to support and help.

üíô Don't sweat the small stuff. Try not to knit pick, rather let some things pass through without highlighting or causing conflict.

üíô Make sure you both have other friends to talk to. This helps in reflection.

üíô Have honest open communication always. Don't hide things. 

I hope some of these help you on your way of being a supportive partner 

Does anyone else have some suggestions that works for them?

instagram,"I am Dominican AND Palestinian. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
 ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
I have been hearing about the conflict between Israel and Palestine since I was a child and finally got to see some of it firsthand when I visited the Holy land in February. I was in Jerusalem when I heard of 10 Palestinians that were killed by Israeli soldiers just 3 miles from where I was. I have walked both sides of the border, where Jesus has walked. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
 ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
This past Saturday my heart sank as I heard of the horrible attack on Israel by Hamas, an extremist group of Palestinians, which does not represent all of Palestine. They govern Gaza where close to 2 million Palestinians have been kept in what is described as an ‚Äúopen air prison‚Äù since 2006. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
 ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
This war is not new, and unfortunately if we look at history it probably has a long way to go. 
 ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
I have been seeing a lot of people saying which side they stand with. Yet both sides have caused harm, both sides have been hurt, both sides have innocent lives that are being attacked and killed. So much division, hatred, and pain in this world. Yet Jesus comes to love and serve us all.
 ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
As a Palestinian, as a Catholic, as a human being, my heart is hurting thinking of what is occurring in such a holy land.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
 ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
I will be offering up prayers and fasting this Monday, Oct. 16 on the feast day of one of my favorite saints, Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, who Jesus revealed his Sacred Heart to. Praying that the people of Israel and Palestine, as well as Afghanistan and those suffering in the world may be brought into His Heart. Will you join me? ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£

instagram,"#BCCI has been facing criticism over low attendance and ticket sales mismanagement in the #ICCWorldCup, as well as a delayed release of the schedule.

In our September cover story, Sharda Ugra writes that the delay had put Jay Shah‚Äôs administrative capabilities under the global spotlight.

A month after the initial schedule was announced, the BCCI administration faced controversy over rescheduling World Cup schedules. Media leaks revealed a need to change the date of the India-Pakistan match from 15 October, originally due to a conflict with Navratri, which Shah later dismissed. Shah claimed disagreements from two or three member countries, without specifying their objections or identities.

Living in a melting pot like California, where diversity is its essence, I am privileged to have friends from varied backgrounds, including Israeli and Palestinian roots.

These images resonate profoundly with me, not merely as abstract tragedies but as palpable echoes of my own heritage. As the son of a Vietnamese refugee, I am all too familiar with the scars left behind by wars that bifurcate families and communities over ideological differences.

According to The Associated Press, Hamas, a group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, launched an attack inside Israel on Oct. 7. As of Oct. 10, over 1,900 people have died in the war.

Aaron Kaufman, the Marcus Family executive director of Penn State Hillel, said the vigil was an important moment to bring Penn State and the Jewish community together to ‚Äúshare our grief and also just show support for each other and our friends of Israel.‚Äù

Image Description- A white background with sans serif font that says: Complexity is not a reason to justify kidnapping, maiming, raping, torturing and murdering innocent people. Humanity is impossible when civilians are disregarded and discarded. And this is how white supremacy works. White supremacy is when no matter what you say to advocate for the liberation and end of murder of oppressed Palestinians, Israelis and Jewish people you are attacked, silenced, threatened and told to pick a side. Dismantling white supremacy starts with humanity and without it this will continue.

instagram,"DAY 5 DRAWS TO AN END

‚ñ™Ô∏èUPDATE: Gaza's power plant has completely shut down due to a severe depletion of fuel reserves, leaving the region without electricity, running water, and working elevators.

üìå Hospitals are relying on emergency generators, which will only last 2-4 days.¬†

üì± Gaza‚Äôs access to telecommunications may also be severely affected due to a lack of electricity + Israeli air strikes destroying key telecom towers.

üáÆüá± ICYMI: Israel is blocking food, fuel, water from entering Gaza + reportedly even aid. 

ü•Ä DEATH TOLL: At least 1,055 Palestinians killed; 5000+ are injured. In Israel, 1200+ killed; 3000+ injured.¬†

üëâüèº ATTACKS: Gaza will be in darkness tonight, as Israel continues its non-stop bombardment of the Strip, in response to Palestinian militant group Hamas‚Äô attack on Oct 7.¬†¬†

üëâüèº Hamas also continues to fire rockets towards southern Israel intermittently + has announced it is targeting the Ben Gurion airport.¬†

ü•Ä NOTE: Israeli bombing has killed four Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics, nine members of the UN and at least eight journalists since Oct 7.¬†

üíª SCHOOLS: Israel‚Äôs schools are shifting to remote learning, per the country‚Äôs education ministry. The online studies ‚Äúwill focus first and foremost on emotional and social aspects, in order to strengthen resilience, and on educational content appropriate for the situation.‚Äù

üåç INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE: British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has reached Israel to show solidarity. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will also arrive in Israel on October 12.

üáπüá∑ Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made another public statement, saying that even war had a ‚Äúmorality‚Äù but Israel‚Äôs response had ‚Äúvery severely‚Äù violated that. ‚ÄúPreventing people from meeting their most fundamental needs and bombing housing where civilians live ‚Äì in short, conducting a conflict using every sort of shameful method ‚Äì is not a war, it‚Äôs a massacre.‚Äù

üá™üá¨ REPORTEDLY: Egypt has discussed plans with the US and other countries to provide humanitarian aid through its border with the Gaza Strip under a limited ceasefire. (Al Jazeera)

instagram,"The needs and struggles of the Palestinian people, and the agenda of Hamas are not the same thing. Hamas represents the average Palestinian about as much as a neo-Nazi skinhead represents a farmer from Nebraska. Hamas is not fighting on behalf of the Palestinian people. Hamas is not fighting for peace. Hamas exists for one reason, and one reason only. And it is not to bring peace and freedom to Palestinians. The plight of the Palestinian people is not a result of Jewish oppression or illegitimate occupation, it is the result of terrorist groups like Hamas continuously propagating violence against a sovereign nation whom they view as their enemy. Hamas often callously and strategically leverages the civilian population as a shield against necessary retaliation by Israel and her allies, for their acts of terror, sometimes tragically resulting in civilian casualties. This then becomes the source of a skewed and inaccurate narrative by Hamas and their supporters which is their justification for an endless cycle of violence. They do not want a peaceful, two state solution. Palestinians and Jews alike deserve a homeland. Geographically there is no reason at all that this can not be a reality. But that is not what Hamas and their allies want. They want the total and absolute annihilation of the Jewish people. The loss of any innocent life as a result of violent conflict is tragic. Until organizations motivated by hate and fueled by violence and division are rooted out and stripped of any influence or authority there is no opportunity for peace. The daily religious and political struggles within Israel, Her territories and the Middle East are almost as old as recorded time. It is understandable that there is deep distrust and resentment, fear, resistance to change and differences that will never be resolved without Divine intervention. What unfolded the last few days in Southern Israel is not those things. The documented acts of brutality by members of Hamas that have come to light are pure evil. Perpetrated by people who have given themselves over to evil. There is no spin that results in their justification.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to form a war cabinet with former defence minister and centrist opposition party leader Benny Gantz and focus entirely on the conflict, a joint statement from Gantz's National Unity party said.

instagram,"Amid conflict between Hamas and Israel, India launched 'Operation Ajay' to bring back Indians from war-hit Israel. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar shared the information about the operation on social media.

Taking to X, EAM Jaishankar wrote, ""Launching Operation Ajay to facilitate the return from Israel of our citizens who wish to return. Special charter flights and other arrangements being put in place. Fully committed to the safety and well-being of our nationals abroad.""

After Operation Ajay was launched, the Indian Embassy in Israel said that the first lot of registered Indian citizens in the war-hit country were notified about their special flight, which would depart on Thursday.

""The Embassy has emailed the first lot of registered Indian citizens for the special flight tomorrow. Messages to other registered people will follow for subsequent flights,"" Indian Embassy in Israel wrote on X.

Amid the conflict, around 18,000 Indians are present in Israel, according to reports.

On October 7, Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza strip launched an attack on southern Israel as Hamas announced the beginning of a new operation - Operation Al Aqsa Storm and launched several rockets on Israel. 

In a recorded message, Hamas military wing chief Mohammed Deif said, ""Enough is Enough"" as he called on Palestinians to join the fight against Israel. In response, Tel Aviv launched an operation called Operation Iron Swords.

Amid the conflict, at least 1,200 Israelis have been killed and around 2,800 wounded, according to the Israeli army's data. The death toll in Gaza has risen to 1,100 and a total of 5,339 people have been wounded amid the conflict, as per the Palestinian Health Ministry. In West Bank, the ministry shared that the death toll has risen to 27 and around 150 people have been injured.

instagram,"Urgent questions face decision-makers in Egypt with an imminent ground invasion of Gaza increasingly likely and the Rafah border crossing ‚Äî the only exit point for Palestinians under siege in the strip ‚Äî closed after Israel conducted three air strikes on the site since Monday night.

Five high-ranking Egyptian political and diplomatic sources, all speaking to Mada Masr on condition of anonymity, unpack the most pressing questions: how can Egypt prevent the potential for tens of thousands of refugees entering Sinai to escape Israel‚Äôs invasion and, second, how, if at all, can Egypt play a role in mediating the conflict given its diminishing role in managing the Palestinian issue? Egypt has little room to maneuver on either front, and sources tell Mada Masr that the political and economic fragility of the country may lead Israel, with US support, to propose a plan to resettle Palestinians in Sinai, especially if this proposal is linked to incentives such as writing off debt or offering other economic incentives.

instagram,"‚ÄûTwee neven zijn dit weekend omgekomen door een raketaanval‚Äù, vertelt een leerling op maandagochtend in de klas van Jaser Husseini, docent burgerschap aan de opleiding autotechniek op ROC Nijmegen. De leerling heeft net aangegeven dat hij niet ok√© is. Vragen hoe het met de tweedejaars leerlingen gaat, doet Husseini vaker. In zijn klas zitten Nederlanders, maar ook best veel vluchtelingen, uit Syri√´, Eritrea.‚Å†
‚Å†
De neven van de leerling woonden in de Gaza-strook, begreep Husseini, waar ze slachtoffer waren geworden van een Isra√´lische vergeldingsactie. De jongen was boos en verdrietig en zat vol vragen: waar√≥m? Die emoties tonen is √≥√≥k onderdeel van onderwijs, vindt Husseini. ‚ÄûJe gehoord en gezien voelen in Nederland.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
Ook bij vakken als maatschappijleer en geschiedenis komt het conflict aan bod. Hoe docenten dat aanpakken, lees je via de link in bio. ‚ÄûSinds ik de persoonlijke verhalen van Isra√´li√´rs en Palestijnen gebruik in mijn lessen, blijft het beter bij ze hangen.‚Äù",,933,"{'like_count': 913, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 117438}",NRC.nl,,2023-10-11 03:00:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/68875641_369775670334958_4942670118246154240_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9YV5BMjv9eIAX-V80Ye&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDEB22oeiuwFWGuwgWyZo8uiJxzWgeSnBZmTeMi1zPc5g&oe=655B61F7,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyPh6MZMUp3/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/387270326_725381729404939_8041963455427431064_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=uYfGyXTPrfYAX9lnReI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDI5iT2wAehJ1Gh-ij8yPAKPcYJuTBFHTAIqbKdBBuCsg&oe=653715B9

The country has faced political repression and instability since it achieved independence in 1960. DRC is the fourth largest African country by population and the most populous francophone country in the world, and is home to an abundance of vital natural resources. 

Currently, eastern DRC is the site of ethnic conflict and violent resource competition involving ethnic militias, Congolese security forces, UN troops, and complex external interests. 

The abundance of natural resources (precious minerals) found in Congolese soil has globalized the conflict in eastern DRC. While U.S. companies once owned vast cobalt mines in the Congo, most were sold to Chinese companies during the Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations. 

Chinese companies connected to Beijing now control the MAJORITY of foreign owned cobalt, uranium, and copper mines in DRC and the Congolese army has been repeatedly deployed to mining sites in eastern DRC to PROTECT CHINESE ASSETS. 

In 2023, DRC is home to an estimated 5.7 million internally displaced people in urgent need of more than 2 billion dollars in medical and other aid. Nearly a million Congolese nationals are seeking refuge in other African states. Exacerbating this need for assistance, the UN has suspended air deliveries of aid to certain eastern provinces.

Casualties remain on the rise as armed groups attack displacement camps, civilians in the DRC and abroad, and self-defense groups. In May, the South African Development Community (SADC) agreed to deploy troops to eastern Congo to assist UN forces ahead of the December 2023 elections.

instagram,"REPOST

In these trying times, our hearts are heavy with the weight of the conflict in the Holy Land. We fervently pray for peaceful solutions to prevail and for an end to the turmoil. It's a solemn reminder that wars do not solve human rights problems; they only deepen the wounds.

Our prayer is for a solution, geared towards harmony and coexistence. Let us remember all the innocent victims, their suffering, and their families. And pray vigilantly and incessantly; may our Lord, in His boundless mercy, hear our prayers and grant us the wisdom to seek understanding and compassion over violence.

instagram,"Of all the topics I‚Äôve covered on @foxnews, this one has hit me the hardest. It‚Äôs shaken me to my core. 

As a human, it is so difficult to watch the devastation. As a mother, it is gut wrenching. A mother's natural instinct to protect her child is the most powerful and fundamental force in nature. It is a force that transcends social, cultural and religious boundaries. Watching children being stripped from their parents and beheaded is horrifying. Hamas needs to be eliminated. Extremism is a human disease which can take many forms. All forms of extremism and hatred must be fought in unity or further division and conflict will arise. 

In addition, humanity is at war. I can only pray that this will serve as an awakening to all of humanity that until we solve the conflict and trauma within ourselves, this world won‚Äôt have peace. It‚Äôs starts within. It starts at home. Hate won't get us there, love will. We must bring down our walls, lead with our vulnerabilities and open our eyes to our similarities as children of God. 

AND 

When America is weak, the world collapses and that's what we are seeing before our very eyes. Leadership, in its most compelling form, is about rising to the occasion, finding one's voice, and standing firm to protect and serve those who depend on you. Effective leadership- whether it be a country or a home - must exhibit courage, tenacity and a deep sense of responsibility. Weakness of the United States leads to global instability or conflicts. A strong and stable United States, as one of the world's leading superpowers, can play a role in maintaining global peace and stability by deterring potential aggressors and maintaining a balance of power.",,908,"{'like_count': 823, 'comment_count': 85, 'num_users': 61666}","Katrina Campins, Real Estate",,2023-10-11 18:45:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/312642061_121138484084416_3218160296548794834_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Mw9tIWqt6vgAX8fsY9a&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBHlPoxVYuCTPB8wCcggRh_BWQSKrLFo3FtBwdU9z00XQ&oe=655AAC84,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRODyJOY0p/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387707139_628065479407688_6922415178210190608_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=WMspszWJ-ksAX_mul1K&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCMLQEHaXj_zPte7h71fnsxd9NkzqCMAT8mRqXTZ5x9ng&oe=655B24BD

instagram,"Dear SBCC Community, 

Our hearts are heavy in understanding the realities of the violent acts in Israel over the weekend. Innocent civilians, including children and elderly, have lost their lives or are wounded, and many others have been taken hostage. This act of terrorism occurred on a major Jewish holiday, and we stand against this unfathomable event. 

Currently, Israeli cities are under attack, and warfare continues in Gaza, with more innocent lives affected. These actions deeply sadden us. Though this conflict may be geographically distant, SBCC recognizes its impact affects many locally and humanity everywhere. 

We want to remind our community that SBCC is a place where we value belonging, compassion, and kindness. We stand ready to offer support and resources to our students, faculty, and staff affected by these tragic events.

instagram,"COLOMBO (News 1st); The Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau has reached a decision to send Sri Lankans to work in Israel only after obtaining the necessary approvals from the Population and Immigration Authority in Israel, the Sri Lanka Embassy in Israel and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Deputy General Manager Gamini Senarath Yapa said the decision was reached taking into consideration the uncertainty caused by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

He said Sri Lankan workers are sent to Israel based on a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two countries.

Sri Lankan Ambassador to Israel Nimal Bandara said if Sri Lankan workers want to leave Israel, they have the opportunity to do so.

He said three flights operate from Israel to Colombo daily, via Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Bahrain.

Bhauma ijya-dhƒ´·∏• - Accepting your country as an object of worship is extended selfishness stemming from deepest ignorance (Andhatamisra). 

It sometimes leads to an erroneous (Viparyaya) glitch of intellect called Bhauma Kapatita Pratyayasarga which makes you accept your political viewpoint as an absolute truth and jump head first to every political/military conflict as a fight between absolute good and evil - an illusory and futile quest for certainty in the world where most of the things are perspective-bound and relative.

instagram,"In a time marked by tension and conflict, the media's role in providing accurate, responsible news coverage becomes even more crucial. A recent incident involving #CNN has raised eyebrows and sparked criticism, as netizens allege the news network of faking an attack on Israeli Occupation.

The controversy centers around a video clip aired by CNN, which depicts an attack in the Israeli Occupation, where rockets are heard. However, what ignited the furor was the voiceover accompanying the video. Critics argue that the voiceover, which carried a British accent, appeared artificial and detached from the original event.

The backlash against CNN primarily revolves around the voiceover's alleged lack of authenticity. Social media users scrutinized the video, asserting that the voiceover sounded pre-recorded and not in sync with the actual events on the ground. This perception has fueled skepticism about the credibility of CNN's reporting.

An Indian political analyst Zaid Khan posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, of CNN's report. He wrote: ""CNN EXPOSED FOR FAKING AN ATTACK IN ISRAEL.""

A social media user replied to his tweet: ""The voice was added over the original soundtrack and is obviously fake. It's terrible that this war is happening, but it's truly diabolical that someone would make light of it. This is not a joke.""

Another replied: ""Why CNN journalists was speaking with British accent?""

One wrote: ""Voiceover is fake as confirmed by the video original author.""

This comes on the fifth day of the 'Operation Aqsa Typhoon' which was launched by Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, in response to Israeli Occupation violations in the occupied Palestinian territories, which have been ongoing for decades.

In #Gaza, at least 950 have been killed in the Israeli Occupation aggression and over 5,000 injured since Saturday.

instagram,"On October 7, 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel under ""Operation Al Aqsa Flood"". 

Attributed as a mastermind, #MohammedDeif was solely responsible for the surprise offensive on Israel.

Deif began to plan the attack from the May 2021 Raid at the Al Aqsa Mosque, where the Israeli forces barged into the mosque during Ramadan.

""It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al Aqsa mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque. All of this fuelled and ignited the anger,"" stated the source to Reuters. A similar raid took place earlier this year, which only added fuel to the fire.

Sources close to Hamas stated that the decision to attack Israel was a joint one between Deif, who is commander of Hamas' Al Qaasam Brigades and Yehya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza. However, the true mastermind behind the attack was Deif.

Recently, a senior official from Hamas stated that only a few commanders of the group were aware of the attack on Israel. Even Iran and Hezbollah were not aware of the attack.

The Reuters report added that Deif's main agenda was to deceive Israel. Israel was led to believe that Hamas was not interested in launching a conflict and instead, was focusing on on economic development in Gaza.

However, once Israel reopened the gates for Gazans to work and began to provide them with economic incentives, Hamas began to train their fighters. The head of external relations for Hamas, ALi Baraka added that the group has been preparing for this fight for the past two years.

""Every day the occupation storm our villages, towns and cities in the West Bank and raid houses, kill, injure, destroy and detain. At the same time, it confiscates thousands of acres of our land, uproots our people from their houses to build settlements while its criminal siege continues on Gaza,"" Deif was heard saying in his recording.

To date there are only three photos of the man, the majority of them show him masked. Deif's whereabouts remain unknown as he continues to work from the shadows.

You will be victorious in the SAME PLACES you had tasted defeat, and your victory will be sweeter for it. I have lost. It does not make me uncomfortable. I do it almost every day and its humility teaches me to win. I win. I am winning. The win does NOT make me proud. I know I have found a higher and harder place to test myself.

instagram,"Are you stuck in a friendship maze, wondering if it‚Äôs time to make a great escape from your current friend group? It‚Äôs a dilemma many of us face at some point in our lives. Friends come and go, but sometimes, it‚Äôs necessary to revisit the dynamics of your social circle. So, how can you tell if it‚Äôs time to pack your bags and leave the friend group behind?

Take a moment to reflect on how you feel when you‚Äôre with your friends. Are you genuinely happy, or do you find yourself constantly drained or anxious? Friends should uplift your spirits, not drain your energy.

Consider your interests and values. Have they evolved, leaving you with little in common with your current friends? It‚Äôs okay to outgrow people, as personal growth is a beautiful part of life. Friends who make you feel excluded and judged are the ones you should part ways with. 

Conflict is another red flag. If you constantly feel misunderstood or unheard in arguments, that could be a sign to just drop the whole argument and walk away. Healthy friendships involve open communication and mutual respect.

instagram,"In the words of my precious friend Rebecca who has family in Palestine üáµüá∏ + in Isreal üáÆüá±. Right now you either side with good or you side with evil. This isn't just a physical battle, this is spiritual warfare taking over the hearts and minds of human vessels. There in no embetween. Peace is the only solution. üïäÔ∏è 

Images + insight are from Rebecca. üíìüëá

I have family in Palestine & Israel right now and this is what I stand for: the very REAL &  innocent people of Israel & Palestine üáÆüá±üïäÔ∏èüáµüá∏ 
‚†Ä‚†Ä
I‚Äôm not open to debate. I don‚Äôt need a history lesson or ‚Äúfacts‚Äù. I don‚Äôt need graphic evidence. 
‚†Ä‚†Ä
I have been aware of this battle since childhood. My grandparents lived part of the year in California & part in Palestine. They rarely spoke about the conflict, and if they did they were clear to distinguish between politics & people. They never spoke a word of hate for the Jewish or Israeli people. As a child, my only evidence for hate was from teachers & classmates who gaslit & shamed me for my lineage. So I chose to lie & hide my ancestry in many spaces. 
‚†Ä‚†Ä
My teenage & young adult mind searched for answers in books & classes, to make sense of the conflict & the ‚Äúsides‚Äù. Yet none of it made sense! Not the situation, not the solutions. It all felt contrived, like dark heavy lies. 
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The only thing that inspires clarity is when I view all of this from a higher perspective, and acknowledge the presence of evil. And from there, my stance is clear: I don‚Äôt side with evil üïäÔ∏è -Rebecca",,692,"{'like_count': 625, 'comment_count': 67, 'num_users': 150735}",Meg Schwarzock AKA ‚ÄúMeg Rock‚Äù,,2023-10-11 11:27:49,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/366469794_234036895773366_3040833832156476375_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pO0rI-qThrsAX-DhjGR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBVfzClIjtyprfF88JVA2ZRlM1MhFD_u-sHeylW5TBScQ&oe=655B5BB7,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyQcA4OLgWf/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391384764_1480004342842063_430979552254440302_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Ir7xGOqCnPUAX8b-ZeB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDqB0KRMTaNp0CihhMJK9ViPCvtCav-ghtcJh3DdmcJTQ&oe=6558D5FE

Structures damaged include animal shelters and vet clinics, with people fleeing the violence with rescued animals.

At this time we are aiming to provide disaster response in the form of pet food for evacuated animals and those that are in shelters and unable to be moved due to the violence. We will also provide veterinary care for injured dogs and cats that are lucky enough to have been rescued and taken for treatment.

This fighting is likely to continue and intensify, and we are now ready to deploy food in to the areas that most need help in the coming weeks. No animal should suffer as a result of war. Your donation aids in providing immediate relief to animals suffering in the conflict zone.

We don't all have to write eloquent or heart-wrenching statements on social media. We don't all have to start movements. But we DO all have a responsibility, as humans, to pay attention. To not shy away. To reflect on what's happening, and to make at least ONE small change in response: squeezing your kids a little tighter tonight, learning about a conflict you've had the privilege not to know much about for the majority of your life, reaching out to a friend to see how they're doing. ‚Å†‚Å†

instagram,"Esther (1875)
By
Hugues Merle (1823-1881)

""Esther"" by Hugues Merle is a masterful representation of Academic style in the art world during the late 19th century. Merle, often likened to his contemporary William Bouguereau, is known for his meticulous attention to detail, and in this particular painting, he draws inspiration from mythology, literature, and religion. The subject of this work is Esther, the celebrated heroine of the Old Testament.

In this captivating piece, Esther's internal turmoil and her courageous decision take center stage. Her eyes convey a profound sense of inner conflict as she grapples with the life-altering choice of breaking court etiquette to intercede for the Jewish people before her husband, King Ahasuerus of Persia. This painting is not only a testament to Merle's artistic skill but also a portrayal of the psychological depth of his subjects.

Esther is surrounded by King Ahasuerus and an attendant, further emphasizing the tension and importance of the narrative. Merle's ability to capture the emotional complexity of the characters in this biblical story is a testament to his talent as an artist.

instagram,"As one who was born and raised Muslim and now is a follower of Jesus. As one who has lived through a war in which Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. As one who faced discrimination after 9/11. As one who can only imagine the horror of what is going on. 

Here are my thoughts: 

We have to resist the temptation to simplify and categorize this into either a pro-Israel or pro-Palestine conflict. This is a pro-humanity conversation. 

Standing with one people group is problematic. In this case there are decades of conflict and injustice on both sides. When you stand with one people group, you automatically discriminate against the other. We subconsciously give ourselves permission to be cruel to a certain people group simply because they belong to that group or are associated with them. We can easily justify distrust, disdain and unloving actions, because we have categorized a certain people group. We need to cry out and seek justice for people regardless if they're Palestinian or they are Israeli. We need to mourn with people wherever they are. Our hearts need to break for loved ones that are being tortured, held hostage and being killed, regardless of their race. We have to stand with each other as one humanity against evil.

Stand against evil. We should not tolerate evil. Evil is so insidious because it wants to fester in the human heart. Evil knows that if we are focused on a certain people group, we will not pay attention to the evil we've allowed to operate in our own lives. The problem has always been evil. Regardless of where it lies - either in an Israeli heart, or a Palestinian heart - it needs to be eradicated. People who've allowed evil to take over their lives should not be allowed to affect innocent lives. 

Stand for justice, not revenge. After 9/11, when terrorists devastated us by their attacks, we went not only after justice, but revenge, and launched ourselves into decades of war. It also gave evil people an excuse to commit hate crimes against particular people groups‚Ä¶

instagram,"So I have been putting off this post because I don't really have the words to express my emotions on it but I can't put it off any longer. 

I am sad. I am devastated. I am angry. I am horrified. I am scared. 

What is happening is the stuff of nightmares. No children deserve this. Quite frankly, no one should be killed for anyone's agenda.

I saw a post from @valariekaur  that said 'Our most powerful response to the horror in Isreal and Palestine is to refuse to surrender our humanity' and she later stated 'I don't know the solution to the conflict in Isreal and Palestine, but I do know the starting point: To grieve ""their"" children as our children. It is the only way to break the cycle.' 

I mentioned I just couldn't articulate my words so I am going to rely on the words of others here. But quite frankly, the losers in every war are innocent children.

Whether you support Palestinian or Jewish people the harm of innocent women, the elderly and children is never okay. 

I am overcome with grief and feel for everyone affected by what is going on. Over 1,000 people have died and over 5,000 have been wounded. My heart breaks for our world. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense but quite frankly nothing makes sense right now.

üá∑üá∫ WHAT: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Oct 10, that the failure of the US policy in the Middle East, which neglected Palestine‚Äôs legitimate need for an Independent State, is to be blamed for the latest Hamas attack on Israel.

üéôÔ∏è Putin made the comment during talks with visiting Iraqi Prime Minister¬†Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani.

üá∑üá∫ He added that the US tried to ‚Äúmonopolise the settlement, but, regrettably, hasn't bothered to search for compromises that would be acceptable to both parties and, just the opposite, sought to enforce their own view..‚Äù

‚ñ™Ô∏èRUSSIA‚Äôs foreign ministry had previously called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Putin‚Äôs spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin was in touch with both sides and would seek to play a role in resolving the conflict but did not give details on how.

üá∫üá∏ MEANWHILE, THE US pledged unwavering support for Israel in a speech delivered by US President Joe Biden on October 10, in which he called attacks by Hamas as ‚Äúan act of sheer evil‚Äù.

üéôÔ∏è Biden‚Äôs speech did not make any mention of Palestinian civilians.¬†

üáÆüá± FYI: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to visit Israel on Thursday, in a show of solidarity.¬†

üìå ALSO: The US could soon have two aircraft carriers (which are accompanied by cruisers, destroyers and fighter jets) in the eastern Mediterranean, a move that would mark a major escalation in US military power in the region. (@politico)

instagram,"All information from The Database of Military and Israeli Security Export, which is provided by the Israeli anti-militarist feminist movement 'New Profile'. 

The genocide that is happening in Palestine is directly supported by countries who are in business with Israel. The reality is that peace is not profitable. For some countries to keep making money, they need others oppressed, or in wars and conflict. That's why these cycles of violence never end. Also, global conflict also reinforces local control - to keep justifying using tax dollars to purchase ""defence‚Äù systems to surveil and control their own population in the name of ""security"". 

By extension, this is why Army exhibitions are labeled 'kid-friendly' and free admission - to normalise violence and fear into our everyday. These weapons that are used to kill human beings - all proudly on display.

I am presenting this information, which is all backed up by sources on https://dimse.info/singapore/ so that you have a fuller picture about what is going on. I want to use my platform to highlight the fundamental incongruence that Singapore's weapons contracts and financial investments are with any version of 'peace' in the world. 

Beyond retweets and shares, we need to hold our own governments responsible. That is the core of the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement. One of the most direct ways to show solidarity with the people of Palestine is by demanding an end to the global military cooperation and arms trade with Israel, starting with our own countries and our own 'suit-wearing arms dealers.' (from the song 'Hand on Your Gun' by @lowkeyonline )

Official notes on the data:
‚ÄúThe figures represent the number of Palestinians and Israelis who were killed or injured since 2008 in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and Israel in the context of the occupation and conflict.‚Äù

‚Äúcollected by OCHA field staff following review and verification. As a rule, for an incident to be entered into the database it needs to be validated by at least two independent and reliable sources. Exceptions to this rule include incidents resulting in Israeli injuries, where information is typically based on media reports.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly casualties that are the result of confrontations between Palestinians and Israelis in the context of the occupation and conflict are included. Incidents resulting in casualties, which did not involve direct confrontations, such as access delays, reckless use of weapons, unexploded ordnance, and collapse of tunnels are not included. People who were killed or injured in conflict-related incidents that took place in Israel and did not involve residents of the oPt are also excluded.‚Äù

Friends from all over Israel and Europe joined me in celebrating my first week as Music Director of this wonderful orchestra. I was overjoyed to share the stage with the incredible musicians, meet the wonderful audience, and work alongside our dedicated team at the orchestra. We continued on with a second celebratory concert in Tel Aviv on Thursday.

On Saturday morning, my wife Sarah and I woke up to the sound of explosions near our hotel. Soon enough, sirens were heard and we spent the day with my parents in and out of the bomb shelter in the basement of our hotel. Thanks to the kind help of friends in Israel, my family and I were able to secure seats on a flight home to Vienna on Sunday. 

I am at a complete loss for words as my friends, extended family, and the musicians of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, are still in Israel, facing unimaginable uncertainty and danger. I'm left speechless, overwhelmed with anger, shock, disbelief, and profound concern, distraught for my new musical family.

A week that was meant to be a celebration of music and togetherness has been overshadowed by the harsh reality of terrorism and conflict.

Yes I‚Äôm aware and I intend to ‚Äî but you need to stop conflating Hamas, a terrorist group, with Palestinian civilians. We should be unanimously condemning the actions of terrorists. Israel is not intentionally targeting civilians. Hamas is. My hope is that those intentionally targeting civilian lives will be eliminated.

instagram,"Regarding Korea's role in the ongoing situation, Shine mentioned that communication is continuing with the Korean government. He placed paramount importance on fostering understanding and expressions of support.

‚ÄúKorea is in communications with many countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and also Iran. And any contribution that someone can make in order to lead stability in the region, will be welcome,‚Äù Shine said.

He also acknowledged that the conflict might have repercussions on investments and economic measures, but he drew from Israel's history to emphasize the nation's capability to rebound from adversity and rebuild.

Shine expressed optimism that once the conflict is resolved, the region will experience long-term stability and offer a conducive environment for business and investments.

‚ÄúIsraelis, the Jewish people, always throughout history, knew how to stand up and overcome the challenges and correct what needs to be corrected and fix what needs to be fixed and this is how we built our country,‚Äù he added.

instagram,"Egypt has reaffirmed its decision to remain neutral in the Israel-Palestine conflict, a stance that gains new significance in light of recent revelations.

An Egyptian intelligence official disclosed that Israel had ignored multiple warnings from Egypt about a looming ""something big"" from Hamas. Despite these alerts, Israeli officials were more focused on the West Bank, underestimating the threat from Gaza.

This comes after Egypt itself was recently attacked by Hamas and experienced an incident involving Israeli tourists and an Egyptian tour guide. 

The Egyptian government's neutrality aims to safeguard its national interests while navigating a volatile regional situation.

In addition to its neutral stance, Egypt is also expected to open a humanitarian corridor between Gaza and its territory.

This move aligns with Egypt's long-standing role as a mediator between Palestine and Israel, especially since signing a peace deal with Israel.

Brent crude rose 26 cents, or 0.3%, to $87.91 a barrel by 0312 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 17 cents, or 0.2%, to $86.14 a barrel.

Brent and WTI surged more than $3.50 on Monday as the military clashes raised fears that the conflict could spread beyond Gaza, but settled lower in Tuesday‚Äôs session.

Israel produces very little crude oil, but markets are worried that the conflict could escalate and hurt Middle East supply, worsening an expected deficit for the rest of the year.

instagram,"The recent viral video of a man being burned in Manipur has been verified by state police, and the CBI will investigate the case, an official said.

Addressing a press conference on Monday evening, security advisor to the Manipur government, Kuldiep Singh, said the person in the seven-second video that surfaced a day ago has been identified as Laldinthanga Khongsai alias Lal James, 37, a resident of Paokhongching under Nongpok Sekmai police station in Kangpokpi district.

The security advisor mentioned that the incident was apparently from May 4, a day after the ethnic conflict started in the state. He further informed that the man‚Äôs body is still unclaimed and lying at the morgue in Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences (JNIMS) in Imphal.

‚ÄúThe DGP has been requested to hand over the case to the CBI as the case is also a sequel of that incident in which two students were killed and two women were paraded naked,‚Äù said the Manipur government‚Äôs security advisor.

In July, a video of two Kuki women paraded naked by a large mob went viral on social media and received condemnation from across the country and internationally over the outrageous act. At least seven persons involved in the incident were arrested by state police and later handed over to CBI for further investigation.

Similarly, four persons were arrested by the CBI last week for their alleged involvement in the killing of two students who went missing on July 6. Photos of their bodies surfaced on September 25 on social media, leading to a series of violent protests across the valley areas.

instagram,"Operation Pawan was a military operation conducted by the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka. It took place between July 11, 1987, and March 24, 1990. The operation was aimed at stabilizing the situation in Sri Lanka during a period of civil conflict. The civil conflict in Sri Lanka stemmed from the demands of the Tamil ethnic minority for greater autonomy and equal rights. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a militant organization, led the armed struggle for Tamil independence. The situation deteriorated, leading to violence and instability in the country. The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, decided to intervene in Sri Lanka to address the deteriorating situation. Operation Pawan involved the deployment of the IPKF, comprising Indian Army and paramilitary forces, to Sri Lanka. Its primary objectives were to disarm the LTTE, maintain peace, and facilitate a political solution to the conflict. Operation Pawan faced several challenges, including resistance from the LTTE, and the situation escalated into a full-scale military conflict. The operation had a significant human and economic cost for India. Despite initial successes, the IPKF's presence and actions faced resistance and opposition from various Tamil militant groups. The operation also resulted in strained relations between India and Sri Lanka. Ultimately, Operation Pawan did not fully achieve its objectives. The IPKF withdrew from Sri Lanka in 1990 without having fully disarmed the LTTE, and the conflict continued for many more years. The operation highlighted the complexities of military intervention in a foreign country's internal conflict and the challenges of achieving a lasting peace settlement. The Sri Lankan civil conflict persisted for nearly three more decades, ending in 2009 with the defeat of the LTTE. #operationpawan #theforgottenwar #talkdiplomacy #upsc #css #upscmotivation #upscaspirants #csstricks #srilanka #ipkf #indianpeacekeepingforce #liberationtigersoftamileelam #rajivgandhi #internationalrelations #internationalrelationsstudent #tamil #1",,526,"{'like_count': 523, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 91579}",TalkDiplomacy IR,,2023-10-11 17:44:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/328799506_219447953811073_3104956161528819700_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pw2J3khjfvsAX8PWC77&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDB5PH0Ztb9ehsOpSDE9OQh8wdqO0qrpdwjjvpSRE76eQ&oe=655AEA98,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRHF6HLqOV/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391250271_1071987583708196_1541615167714858691_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=gjVeNFo6-uQAX9oHjqq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDSWcBRkkQudTY27Nck2UKnWk2VkcJk2JTQWtaJ_0m08A&oe=6539DA87
instagram,"Today, my heart is heavy as I contemplate the ongoing war in Israel. It is a conflict riddled with senseless killing and unimaginable acts of violence. The innocent lives lost, the women and children taken away from their families‚Äîit is a tragedy that shakes us to our core. 

In the midst of this chaos, it is difficult to comprehend the motivations of those who perpetrate such heinous acts. How can anyone justify the intentional harm inflicted upon the most vulnerable members of society? It is a cowardly and despicable act, one that defies the very essence of humanity.

Religion, meant to be a source of solace, guidance, and love, has become a battleground for divisiveness and hatred. People have lost sight of the core teachings that advocate compassion, understanding, and respect for one another. We have allowed our own beliefs to blind us, to turn us into agents of destruction rather than forces of healing.

God, in any faith tradition, teaches us love. It is a universal message that transcends borders, cultures, and religions. Love is the foundation upon which true peace is built. Yet, in the midst of this turmoil, love seems to be overshadowed by fear, anger, and vengeance.

For those of us fortunate enough to live in more stable regions, let us pause before we complain about the trivialities of our daily lives. We are blessed with safety, security, and opportunities that many others can only dream of. Our complaints pale in comparison to the harrowing reality faced by those living in war-torn areas.

As we witness the destruction and devastation unfolding before our eyes, it becomes increasingly difficult to find the right words to express our sorrow. The fear and pain endured by the innocent victims are unimaginable to those of us watching from afar. It is a pain that pierces the soul and leaves us searching for answers.

In times like these, we must unite in our shared humanity. Regardless of our faith, ethnicity, or nationality, we must stand together against the forces of evil that seek to divide us. We must raise our voices for peace, advocate for justice, and work tirelessly to create a world where every life is valued and cherished.",,525,"{'like_count': 486, 'comment_count': 39, 'num_users': 57340}",Brandi Holmes,,2023-10-11 05:32:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/346586650_1225966811419346_3591395865083701748_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ymyQb94z2qMAX-7UT02&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB38vcxynHQwVm5QKUxwrfeWPX5TFb_8CjKsjH0LE0R3g&oe=6559DC6D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyPzUlIMbBu/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387740843_663092512461430_3778491851503993127_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=PkmCZxpIIhAAX-KcQlI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCPCO643HT_iJnCtkISvUA3_jsDo8HkIuRP_uROZI2DSg&oe=655A59DF

instagram,"Violated

It‚Äôs such a big word- but as people have been checking in on how I feel about yesterday it‚Äôs the one word that keeps resurfacing. I feel violated. 

Yesterday after a lovely morning of coaching client calls and meetings-I went to my happy place my beloved @airstream_inc Gidget to meet my partner in #airstreamrenovation crime @truman.pollard - only to discover the lock on the front door was missing and later to be found cut and cast aside. 

Once I opened the door my fear was confirmed- someone had broken in and stolen almost ALL of my tools. Almost all of the items I have worked so hard to collect. If I am honest about my feelings- these tools have been more than tools over the last three years they have been companions and investments into ‚Äúwhat could be.‚Äù A pact between me and Gidget- ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a lot but what I have I will invest in you.‚Äù

I know they are just ‚Äúthings‚Äù and while it will take $1000‚Äôs of dollars to replace them‚Ä¶  it‚Äôs not just their monetary value that I grieve. 

I grieve feeling safe working on her. It is clear by how the break in occurred it was thought through-  someone came with the right tools and at the right time- Leaving me with the unnerving question was I being watched? 

I grieve the countless hours I spent with just these tools and a hope of restoration and repair. The belief that with these tools I could tangibly revitalize that which many people saw as beyond restoration‚Ä¶ And I grieve the even more countless hours that with these tools incredible people have joined me and gave of their time declaring that they too saw the ‚Äúnot yet visible.‚Äù

I grieve the fact that some are irreplaceable hand me downs and gifts from family and friends that signaled their belief in me and my ability to repair the once dilapidated 1973 beauty that is Gidget. 

Will I be able to get new tools- slowly yes-  but with all the heaviness of this current world the conflict and senseless loss I feel like sh*t today. I am grateful for Truman who stayed with me for 3 hours while we waited for the police that never could show due to other emergencies and for friends who cooked me dinner and poured me wine and listened to my grief expressed.",,503,"{'like_count': 368, 'comment_count': 135, 'num_users': 7909}",Sarah Heath,,2023-10-11 15:56:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/166574849_2237184633081203_2906100719197043824_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=jVsxme4j_E8AX9RVWBD&_nc_oc=AQkTKLGc0lqMJjzs1w6ESISoe7ICVx_SOBtsqdLZSMHh0rl3pcuXIPW3WSMqGG34t-w&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB2HhkdGEbb5H_I68ydRL77FOQtWiLlRw_YkAiHnri1JA&oe=655AD341,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyQ6tzTrTN5/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391384446_283502051319750_1682437372967846149_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=FbIf5VGaIE0AX9j3vwr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAJK6alNS0kOvdAoCaUSppO1tB99i18V9yFV47_gDVLug&oe=655A2768

instagram,"On 2nd November 1917, a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War kicked off over 100 years of confusion, conflict and all-out war. This is the Balfour Declaration.

Written three years into Britain's declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire by the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour and addressed to Lord Rotschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, the statement announced its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, which was back then an Ottoman region with a small minority Jewish population. One week later, the statement was published in the press... and the rest is a long and blurry history.

Fast forward three decades and two world wars, and Britain passed on ""the Palestine problem"" to the United Nations in early 1947. ""We have tried for years to solve the problem,"" a representative told the UN. ""We now bring it to the United Nations in the hope that it can succeed where we have not.""

One year and a redrawing of the region's new borders later, Zionist military forces expelled at least 750,000 Palestinians and captured 78% of historic Palestine. The remaining 22% was divided into the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, two of the world's most contested and conflict-heavy territories in recent history.

Fast forward seven and a half more decades of conflict, and this weekend saw an escalation which has devolved into an all-out war between Israel and Hamas. Barrages of rockets are being fired from both sides, and hundreds of civilians and citizens continue to be found dead with every passing day.

instagram,"Hamilcar Barca, often celebrated as the father of the renowned Hannibal, assumed the challenging role of leading Carthaginian forces in an effort to regain territory lost to Rome in Sicily. As discussed earlier, the strategically vital city of Agrigentum had been captured by Rome.

Hamilcar's campaigns in Sicily began with promise. His forces secured a series of victories against the Romans, resulting in significant territorial gains on the island. Hamilcar's strategic genius and adaptability on the battlefield played a pivotal role in these early successes.

However, as the conflict continued, Hamilcar encountered logistical and strategic obstacles. Maintaining his forces in Sicily proved to be challenging due to Carthage's limited resources and the difficulty of providing adequate support. These constraints hampered his ability to conduct further offensive operations.

The Romans were formidable adversaries as their adaptability to Carthaginian tactics and strategies presented an ongoing challenge to Hamilcar. The Roman navy, in particular, posed a significant hurdle.

Nevertheless, in the face of these challenges, Hamilcar demonstrated remarkable tactical brilliance. His ability to secure victories and capture strategic positions highlighted his military prowess. His adeptness at choosing advantageous terrain and using it to his advantage in battle was a standout feature of his campaigns.

Hamilcar Barca's campaigns in Sicily, characterized by a mix of successes and obstacles, left a lasting legacy. They laid the foundation for Carthaginian military endeavors that followed and etched a memorable chapter in history. These lessons would be inherited by Hamilcar's son, Hannibal Barca, who would refine them in his renowned campaigns during the Second Punic War.

instagram,"APCLS rebels on the march, outside of Kitchanga, 2022. 

Fighting is currently ongoing across North Kivu as a counter-offensive is launched against M23 rebels. Mai-Mai and Nyatura militias, under the banner of the ‚Äòpatriotic self-defense‚Äô forces, are on the march, occupying much of Masisi territory. 

Eastern Congo is home to over 120 armed groups, with the Kivu provinces torn apart by these rebel fiefdoms. 

Many of these groups were re-mobilised at the end of 2022 as the Congolese army forgave former enemies in the hope of galvanising support and slowing the rapid advance of M23 across the province. Good Rebels versus Bad Rebels. 

Yet, more used to banditry against civilians than sustained combat, these militias were swept aside by M23 units which nearly succeeded in isolating the city of Goma. 

In the town of Kitchanga, shortly before it fell to M23 in January 2023, I met General Janvier as he was mustering his APCLS Mai Mai combattants. 

Through the years, the town has had a macabre history of occupations and counterattacks. In 2018, on my very first commission in Eastern Congo, I was sent there to photograph demobilised child soldiers, recovering from deeply traumatising experiences. 5 years on, and as Kitchanga changes hands for the 3rd time so far in the conflict, it is clear that impunity reigns still.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford is calling on an NDP MPP to step down following her comments on the Israel-Palestine war that Jewish groups called abhorrent Tuesday.

In a statement from the Premier‚Äôs Office, Ford said Hamilton Centre MPP Sarah Jama should resign ‚Äúimmediately.‚Äù

‚ÄúHer views do not represent Ontario. They have no place in the legislature, and they have no place in this province,‚Äù Ford wrote on Wednesday.

Jama‚Äôs post to X, formerly Twitter, has remained up since it first drew controversy nearly 24 hours earlier. In it, Jama called for a ceasefire in the area of the conflict and demanded an end to what she described as the apartheid of the Palestinian people.

Jama did not address the recent surprise Hamas attack on Israel, which the Israeli military said left more than 1,000 people dead.

Following the post, Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles called on Jama to take it down and said the statement was not approved by caucus.

instagram,"Israeli police say they‚Äôve frozen multiple accounts on the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance that they believed were related to Hamas.  Hamas solicited cryptocurrency donations to the accounts online following the group‚Äôs surprise attack on Israel last weekend, according to Israeli police.

‚ÄúWith the outbreak of the conflict, Hamas initiated a fundraising campaign on various social networks, urging the public to deposit cryptocurrencies into its accounts,‚Äù a police statement said. ‚ÄúThe Police Cyber Unit and Ministry of Defense immediately took action to locate and freeze these accounts, with the assistance of the Binance crypto exchange, in order to divert the funds to the state treasury.‚Äù

It is not clear if the Binance accounts financed any part of Hamas recent attacks on Israel, or how much money was moved to Israel‚Äôs state treasury.

Digital wallets linked to Hamas received $41 million between August 2021 and June 2023, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing Tel Aviv crypto analytics firm BitOK.

Donors and recipients of certain types of cryptocurrency exchanged on Binance can be anonymous, but new developments in blockchain tracking and identity mandates are allowing authorities to track and seize more illicit exchanges.

A Binance spokesperson said their team has been working ‚Äúaround the clock, to support ongoing efforts to combat terror financing.‚Äù Hamas is designated as a foreign terrorist organization in Israel and the U.S.

Hamas is holding at least 150 Israeli hostages that they kidnapped on Saturday during coordinated surprise attacks that killed more than 1,200 Israels, including 100 residents of a kibbutz and 260 at a music festival in Negev desert.  Israeli reprisal strikes on blockaded Gaza have killed 1,100 people, Gaza‚Äôs health ministry said Wednesday.

Israel has mobilized 300,000 reservists, and struck more than 200 targets in parts of Gaza City overnight that it said had been used by Hamas to launch its attacks.

instagram,"Wasanii wa zamani walipata pesa zaidi kuliko wasanii wa sasa - Hii ni Opinion sio Fact.

Wasanii wa zamani walipata pesa nyingi direct kupitia mziki wao kuliko hawa wengi wa sasa, changamoto ni hawakua na kelele pa kuzipigia.

Ndio maana Sugu akisema ndie alikua msanii wa kwanza kuendesha gari fulani and blah blah hakuna anaeamini maana kipindi hicho mitandao hakuna, only means kubwa ya Media ilikua ni Radio ambazo story kama hizo zilikua ni nonsense kwao.

- Moja ya sababu kuu ambayo ilifanya wasanii wa zamani wapate pesa zaidi ni biashara ya muziki ilikua inaendeshwa na wafanyabishara... Changamoto ya sasa washika dau au mashabiki na wasanii wanafanya zaidi biashara ya muziki. Ni kitu kizuri ila kuna conflict of interest nyingi zinatokea.

Ngoja niwape mfano kwa Dunia biashara ya muziki ilivyo;

- Huko Duniani biashara ya muziki inaendeshwa na wafanyabishara, wasanii na wadau... Ambapo wote kwa pamoja utawakuta wanafanya kazi katika record labels na major labels.

Major Labels - Universal, Sony, Warner...

Record Labels - WcB, Aftermath, Interscope etc... Hata wale ambao wana operate as independent wanaingia kwenye hii category!

Bongo kipindi hicho tulikua na MJ Records, Bongo Recs ambazo wengi ndio wanazijua hizi zilikua ni Record Labels,,, Zilikua zinafanya kazi zaidi na Mamu ambae ndie alikua msambazaji mkuu - Huyu tunaweza kusema alikua ni kama Major Label.

Mamu yeye alikua ni mfanyabiashara ambae aliona fursa kwenye muziki, Record Labels Zilikua zinaendeshwa na wadau, wasanii wa muziki... Na ndio maana kila mwaka zilikua zinazalisha vipaji vipya maana ilikua ni kama wanalima maana ndio kipato chao.

Source ya income kuu ilikua ni mauzo ya albums, shows (ambazo nyingi walikua wanapigwa sababu ya teknolojia kipindi hicho) ila mapato makubwa yalikua kupitia mauzo ya kazi zao.

Kwenye mauzo ya albums pia walikua wanapigwa lakini sio kwamba walikua hawapati pesa, pesa walikuwa wanapata ila katika mikataba ya hovyo!

Hata huko Duniani wasanii wengi mapato ya kazi zao zoote ni nadra kukuta msanii anakula 70%... Wengi ni 20% mpaka 30% zingine zinaenda kwa Record na Major Labels.

instagram,"Several synagogues and places of worship in the DMV have organized prayer services amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East. A special Israel solidarity Shabbat service is scheduled to take place at the B'nai Israel Congregation in Rockville on Saturday.

D.C. has already implemented heightened security measures around various places of worship, while Montgomery County is increasingly concerned about the potential rise in hate crimes, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitic incidents in the days ahead.

The recently established Anti-Hate Task Force held a planned meeting on Tuesday night, with a significant focus on the ongoing Israeli conflict with Hamas. Notably, the agenda for this meeting included a discussion of the Muslim cohort report, which reveals that 98% of Palestinians identify as Sunni Muslims.

Montgomery County is home to approximately 12,000 Muslims, constituting a vital part of the community. Furthermore, the Jewish community comprises around 10% of Montgomery County's population. Local leaders are actively collaborating to counteract the significant uptick in hate and bias-related incidents.

Tragically, the situation in the Middle East has led to a substantial loss of life. According to the Israel Defense Forces' Army Radio, more than 1,000 people have lost their lives in Israel since last Saturday, and, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, around 900 people have perished in Gaza during the same period.",,424,"{'like_count': 388, 'comment_count': 36, 'num_users': 139739}",The DMV Daily,,2023-10-11 21:56:34,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/356798357_1316529275967161_2765312089041405943_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ScNd6Bl065oAX-rz2YT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAYFku0SfpWKBqRmfFePlHbs-1wOdjgpE8pghexv2MxOg&oe=6559D95B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRj9-iRc-S/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391726831_18391489651039550_8647903164927223737_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Wl3VwbxLZroAX9O0MB-&_nc_oc=AQnyIJtw6yD38x2CVjY9HHxvt35dTSMaGFTtlCKTWi5UX9rJS8_SWtSSHkCCueN-h6w&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA7WUF2q3CwYe2R3BPQqkUFae9W0bOkA_CkEc1wL9oEXg&oe=6530DDDA

Day 2 I got back at ‚Äòem pretty good (96.25) & caught so many over 18 inches that I lost count!

Justin Trudeau and the Liberal government being backed by the NDP are taking us down a very dangerous road.

instagram,"A little over a decade ago, a conflict in the Middle East showed the power of social media to keep global audiences informed about crises in real time. 

The way people used Facebook and Twitter during the uprisings known as the Arab Spring led to a surge of optimism about the important role these services could play for sharing information, organizing communities and even spreading democracy. For their part, tech companies leaned into that purpose, even as it became obvious that their platforms could be manipulated in ways that undermined it. 

Now another conflict in the Middle East is showing that the social media industry no longer sees that high-minded vision as part of its core mission. Tap the link in bio for more.

instagram,"PART ONE OF TWO

14-year-old Klondike entered Riverside Shelter in May as a severely matted and flea-infested stray. After he was euth-listed, we put a hold on him and began arranging for his exit. We put out a plea for volunteers to do his freedom ride, which Jayne Kleinfeld saw while she was sitting on the Frosted Faces Foundation‚Äôs porch while waiting for her Frosted Face Beck and Charlie‚Äôs vet appointments. She offered to go get him and brought him down to us safely.

Jayne found that she couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about Klondike and came back to scoop him up for a Fling that same week! After their two-week Fling was up and she brought him back to Frosted Faces Foundation, she was completely devastated and cried every day! She missed him so much and ultimately realized that she couldn‚Äôt imagine not being his family. Jayne made it official and adopted Klondike! Here is an update on how he is doing: 

‚ÄúKlondike has settled in fantastically! I initially took him on a Fling before I adopted him, and within a few hours of being here, he had become my shadow and was following me everywhere. He's super low maintenance and has been a joy to have around. He always gets rave remarks on how sweet and calm he is when he visits the Frosted Faces vet staff for appointments!
 
It was a little bit of an adjustment for my non-Frosted Face Farrah to get used to him at first. To be clear, this was a one-sided feud that Farrah instigated - Klondike did absolutely nothing wrong! I think Farrah was just intimidated by him because he's a little bit bigger than her and she felt that her alpha status was being threatened.

instagram,"üö® CW: Sexual assault, rape

In a historic, impassioned speech expressing unbridled U.S. support for Israel on Tuesday, President Joe Biden listed among the atrocities Hamas had committed that women ""were raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies.""

A White House spokesperson told the Forward that this assertion was based on a phone call earlier that day in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had told Biden that Israeli women had been ""brutally raped and murdered."" Similar characterizations have been included in condemnations of Hamas by columnists, celebrities and editorial boards.

But the source of the rape allegation remains murky. While sexual assault is a common feature of violent conflict worldwide, the Israel Defense Forces told the Forward Tuesday night that it does not yet have any evidence of rape having occurred during Saturday‚Äôs attack or its aftermath. And most mainstream media outlets have avoided mention of rape, with the Los Angeles Times and NBC News specifically stating they have been unable to verify the claims.

How references to rape became a ubiquitous element in denunciations of the unprecedented Hamas attack exposes the challenges of understanding a war that is unfolding in real time across social media.

instagram,"The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) World Service has condemned Israel‚Äôs bombing of its office in the Gaza Strip amid an ongoing conflict in Palestine, noting the move was meant to muzzle the voices of those seeking to expose Israeli crimes in Gaza.

A statement issued by the IRIB‚Äôs World Service on Wednesday said that Israel‚Äôs bombing a day earlier of a joint office in Gaza run by the Tehran-based Al-Alam and Press TV news channels revealed the ‚Äúcriminal identity‚Äù of Israel and the fact that terrorism is deeply rooted in the regime.

The statement warned that Israel‚Äôs targeting of media staff and journalists in Gaza, including its bombing of the office of the two Iranian news channels, is a desperate attempt to create an information vacuum in Gaza and thus to prepare the ground for committing massacre against the people of the besieged territory.

instagram,"In yesterday‚Äôs morning NPR news briefing, Israeli Cabinet Minister Ron Dermer vehemently insisted that the world should accept Israeli operations that kill civilians. His tone was calloused and firm. It was chilling.

Three days ago, Israel declared war on Hamas and launched air strikes into Gaza which consists of 2 million people, 42% of which are children.

Hamas must be held accountable for their crimes of war and yet, we can not allow Israel to answer with war crimes of their own.

Gaza is out of power. The last hospitals will soon completely stop functioning. People cannot escape except through a single exit into Egypt and only once they have been cleared to leave. Once out of Gaza, they have no assurance of safety, shelter, food, or other basic needs. They will once again live completely displaced.

All parents want safety and freedom for their children. Both sides have lost a great deal during this conflict. We must come together to end occupation and apartheid so all the children and their children can one day know peace.

War and vengeance only perpetuate death and destruction.

If we want a better future we must choose to take a new path, right now, amongst the pain and destruction. We must commit to peace.

I leave you with this Jewish proverb.

‚ÄúLet the Good in me connect with the good in others, until the world is transformed through the compelling power of love.‚Äù ‚Äì Rabbi Nachman of Breslov

instagram,"Dear @proper_naija_boy,

Thank you for your feedback. Bethlehem, where Yeshua (Jesus) was born, Jericho, Hebron, and many other cities Christians go to for pilgrimage are in Palestine. 

Nazareth, where Yeshua lived, is one of the largest Palestinian cities, but it is politically in Israel, because of the way the post conflict map was drawn. Almost 100% of the population of Nazareth are Palestinians. They are the ones looking after the suspected site of Yeshua's home. They have NEVER desecrated it one day. 

Many of the holy sites are in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Yeshua was baptised in Jordan, not Israel. The people looking after those Christian pilgrimage sites are Muslims. And they permit free snd unfettered access to Christians and followers of Yeshua. 

I have visited all these countries and places, including Egypt. Gaza is between Egypt and Israel. Gaza was where the Ethiopian eunuch received Christ in Acts chapter 8. I am an eyewitness. Palestinians are more receptive to Christians than Israelis. Palestinians speak Arabic but are not Arabs. They are Mediterraneans. The Arabs among them are those who migrated there. 

Please let us think, speak, and act based on knowledge and not based on brainwashing by the media. 

Thanks again, and may God bless you.

instagram,"Song Story: ‚ÄúHalf Here‚Äù
One of our first writing sessions after our first child was born, I looked at Daniel and said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this right now. I am literally half here.‚Äù He proposed that I instead go take some time and write about that‚Ä¶

Early motherhood has been a challenging war of interests. Even two and 3/4 years into this parenthood journey, I feel constantly torn in two. If I am working, I feel like I am neglecting my children, whose needs are (understandably) unceasing. If I am tending only to the children I feel as though an important part of me is atrophying. I often feel the loss of this great creative joint effort Daniel and I used to regularly share and enjoy together. To be a mother with additional vocation is to be in perpetual conflict. 

Our culture says you can have it all as a woman, but I am honestly not sure if that is true, or at least the ‚Äúit all‚Äù that everyone keeps referring to comes with some small print that I didn‚Äôt see when considering this path of family expansion. And of course there is this other factor, the biological one: wherein a great percentage of my brain power and life force is daily siphoned off without my knowledge, employed in the work of milk production and body repair, slackened by sleep deprivation and internal conflict.

Let the record reflect that I adore our children. They are beautiful individuals with intricate personalities and I have so much respect for who they already are and who they are becoming. I even enjoy them much of the time. I think it is precisely my appreciation of them and my desire for them to have the space to expand that makes focusing on other things so difficult for me. FOMO is also a real factor.üòÇ

The song ‚ÄúHalf Here‚Äù was one that felt like it wrote itself. It proceeded from the ether, each line seeming to lead to the next until it was done. Afterward I just felt grateful to have a song that so fully expressed where I was at that moment in my life (currently, too?), and yet one that still allowed me to feel alive and lovely when singing it. Daniel sat down with me afterward and came up with that
delightful guitar part that keeps it feeling breezy the whole way through.",,357,"{'like_count': 328, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 7355}",Lowland Hum,,2023-10-11 17:47:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/375466561_685434913477424_5392620803824047336_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0VIDmxLqNgwAX9xwl99&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDryyf_zhO3oZbENdy5Bn8LQ1yefinxlNHPYE76YtBxVw&oe=655AA3B9,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRHf3mOKPK/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387740044_705912468057727_1741824714974755337_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=r68IlsP7MXQAX-kBEQf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBDIGbq99MI-TjtBLrO1wixcvJqkpy1tWyG4n0Tj8KHwg&oe=6559EACC

Watch out with screentime lovers.

Engage with your friends from areas of conflict. Don‚Äôt add more fuel to a conversation where you have no full historical knowledge over. 

Speak in words of peace not in words of proving you know what is going on in areas of conflict and have to choose a side. 

The only side to be chosen is your heart. 
And when you listen to your heart, we all know that our world is divided in race that brings privileges. 

I am so tired of hearing the narrative that people from the ¬¥orient‚Äô are barbaric, violent, not educated. 

We thaught you how to bath, how to read stars, how to count, we are the bridge between the east and the west.

Our patience must be divine. Innallaha ma sabireen

There were myriad reasons the journey for this little boy was hard. Community, cultural, religious expectations.
And every year I talk about how, despite advances, it‚Äôs still so hard for so many, and impossible for others to consider coming out.
And that‚Äôs still so true. And if you‚Äôre reading and not ready or not able, we‚Äôre here when you are or can.
But I‚Äôm also absorbed, as most are, in the horrid conflict happening in real time and thinking mostly of the gay and queer Jews and Palestinians I know. And how many of them are being asked to account for the terrible actions of others.
It‚Äôs a reminder that gay and queer are a part of us, but so are so many other things. And so many around the world can‚Äôt even consider their queerness because of more basic threats to their lives, worlds and existence.
I don‚Äôt have answers, but I do know the strange social media jockeying and posturing requiring the most exhaustive series of caveats to state even the most basic care for equality and human dignity isn‚Äôt helping Jews and Palestinians here and certainly not any in the path of the destruction.

The identity of the Sri Lankan female who was reportedly killed in the Israel conflict had not been established yet, the Sri Lankan ambassador in Israel told the Daily Mirror today.

instagram,"The reports I am receiving from Israel and Gaza are horrifying. It‚Äôs absolutely saddening to see the level of carnage and death on both sides. War should never be an option, and it‚Äôs time we shift our focus from political and religious agendas to the human faces behind the statistics.
 
There's no justification, no ideology, and no belief system that can legitimise the abduction and killing of civilians including children. Such acts defy the basic principles of humanity. It goes against the faith we profess and must be vehemently opposed by everybody. 

Violence begets only more violence. We have a moral responsibility to advocate an immediate cessation of violence and encourage reconciliation. Both Israelis and Palestinians have ancient roots in the region.
To achieve peace, reconciliation and restitution must be the cornerstone. The two sides must find common ground, heal wounds, and acknowledge the humanity in one another. Seeing people as humans will minimise collateral damage and foster understanding and kindness. 

The world has witnessed enough suffering; it's time for the cycle of violence to cease. It‚Äôs time to build bridges and to ensure that future generations might know a life not defined by conflict and death but by harmony, tolerance, and peace.

My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the ongoing conflict. I pray for God to calm the storms of war and touch the people‚Äôs hearts to create a new path to peace and harmonious co-existence in Israel and Palestine.

instagram,"The Moroccan government is unlikely to carry out repatriations of its citizens in Israel amid the ongoing conflict, an undisclosed source told Hespress. 

The decision is primarily influenced by the relatively small number of Moroccans exclusively holding Moroccan passports, ""which does not exceed a few dozen,"" the same source noted.

This limited number of Moroccan citizens in Israel likely relocated to other countries, such as Turkey, following the escalation between Israeli forces and Hamas fighters.

The same source highlighted that Moroccans holding both Israeli and Moroccan passports are essentially residents of Israel, making their deportation to Morocco impractical.

instagram,"Thank you to everyone who came out last night for a full house of the screening and discussion of Gaza Fights for Freedom! We had a wonderful dinner from @alsalamgrill. 

Since the historic launch of the Al-Aqsa Flood uprising by the Palestinian resistance on October 7, the apartheid Israeli government has declared ""total war"" on Gaza and it's ramped up its siege of the Strip that is home to more than 2 million Palestinians. The Israeli campaign of indiscriminate bombing and the cutting off of vital utilities such as water and power has led to widespread casualties.

Meanwhile, the imperialist media is painting this siege as a two sides ‚Äúconflict‚Äù between Israel and Hamas, even creating sensational stories to victimize Israel. The media conveniently leaves out the 75 years of open air prison conditions, sanctions, and war crimes leading up to this point where Palestinians have no other option besides a brave, armed resistance against US-funded Israeli apartheid.

Now more than ever we need real journalism, not funded by the ruling class that sides with Israel. Follow @BTnewsroom for a people‚Äôs news room and socialist analysis of what‚Äôs happening in Palestine.

instagram,"üìò ‚Ä¢ The Fastest Way to Fall by Denise Williams‚Å£
‚Å£
üìñ ‚Ä¢ The Fastest Way to Fall is a slow-burn, friends-to-lovers romance in which Britta, a journalist at a lifestyle site, signs up for a fitness app as part of a work project and is paired with Wes, the app‚Äôs CEO, as her online fitness coach. However, neither disclose their true motives or job titles.
‚Å£
üí≠ ‚Ä¢  I really love the fat representation in this novel. Britta is fat and happy with her body. She looks good and knows it, yet decides to try a fitness routine to feel better. There is no real talk of diets for Britta in sight. There is simply a fat woman happy and confident in with the way she looks. I thought Williams did a great job showing that Britta‚Äôs contentment with her body did not exclude her from feeling society‚Äôs anti-fatness.

However, I wish I could say that the rest of The Fastest Way to Fall worked as well for me. I could not get past the very contrived plot. When Britta and Wes begin communicating, I had a hard time believing the unnatural progression. Their flirting and eventual meeting up was so awkward and uncomfortable. There was no way I could lose myself in the flirtation that felt like a creepy middle school fantasy.

‚Å£The main conflict in The Fastest Way to Fall is that neither protagonist fully discloses their job to the other. Normally, this would not be the biggest deal (although it would be super unusual), but how they meet is centered around their professional roles. The ethical issues with their jobs stressed me out. The fact that it did not worry the character‚Äôs more seemed unrealistic. Neither tried to immediately address the situation, despite there being an easy solution, and instead waited until shit hit the fan. At that point, I was annoyed with both characters for making stupid choices that they knew would end poorly. A majority of the conflict could have been easily avoided by making responsible decisions in the interest of their careers and livelihoods. You cannot convince me that two (presumed) millennials would make these choices. Have you met us?

instagram,"Here‚Äôs some real talk for Coming Out Day.

Coming out is an expression of authenticity, and as such, it deserves every respect and honor!

It‚Äôs not easy to claim your truth‚Äîin any way. 

We‚Äôre programmed to not rock the boat, to be homogenous, to blend in.

And when we don‚Äôt do that‚Äîwhen we stand out‚Äîit‚Äôs dangerous.

There‚Äôs a scientific reason for this:

We evolved as a communal species, and as such, we‚Äôre literally hardwired for connection with each other.

In order to foster that connection, we try to have as much in common with others as possible, thus helping us avoid conflict and rejection.

Rejection literally feels to our Autonomic Nervous System like a very real threat of death.

Think about it: if, when we were tribal people hunting and gathering in groups, you were exiled from the community, your ass was gonna get eaten by a sabertooth tiger. You were definitely, 100% gonna die. RIP, you.

That‚Äôs how intensely we feel the threat of rejection.

So coming out, which already puts you in a social minority, is a scary fucking thing, even if everyone in your life is supportive.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: if you‚Äôre not out, a day like today can leave you feeling like maybe you‚Äôre not living authentically.

And watching people you know in your community come out and celebrate their own authenticity might make you feel a different kind of rejection and other-ness.

It might feel like a no-win scenario, but hear me out‚Ä¶

So what if you‚Äôre not out yet?! You have your reasons, and that‚Äôs good enough for you, so it should be good enough for everyone.

If the most authentic thing for you to do in this moment is not come out on National Coming Out Day, then don‚Äôt!

If the most authentic thing for you to do is come out to the people you can trust and the people you feel comfortable with and not all of your 20k TikTok followers, then great! Do that!

Just whatever you do, try not to shame yourself.

Please don‚Äôt shame yourself for your queerness. You‚Äôre beautiful and perfect and Divine.

Please don‚Äôt shame yourself for coming out or not coming out. You‚Äôre beautiful and perfect and Divine.

Let‚Äôs just start there. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàü§ç

instagram,"My response to this message that I received today:

-Maybe I need to repeat it again and again. I am against the killings of innocent Israeli civilians by Hamas, Hezbollah as much as I am against the slaughtering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza by Israeli Defense Forces or by any group on either sides in this conflict and regardless of their religion or nationality. 

I don't think we should justify  any mass murdering of innocent  Jews, Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, animists or Atheists on the basis of our beliefs 
That same lord that you are expecting to come back to judge us all if we are still here said in Mark 12:31 to love your neighbor as yourself. 
So I guess he will will judge us for killing our Israeli or Palestinian neighbors. He also said that we should turn the other cheek when we get slapped.
No offense, to be honest to you, I am not waiting for a god to come back for me to stand for right and against wrong. Our conscience should be our judge when we condone oppression in the name of our beliefs 
All human beings are entitled to the same rights to have a roof over their heads and not have rockets, missiles and bombs destroy their homes and make them homeless in the name of Allah, Yahweh, Jesus, Buddha or Krishna. I care about all human beings regardless of their 
religion, race, ethnicity, social status, gender or sexuality. 
We should all stand for equal rights and justice for all our fellow humans and see in others the same humanity in us. My sympathy goes to all Israelis who were killed and harmed by Hamas. I condemn what Hamas did. And my sympathy goes also to the millions of Palestinians being bombed by  Israeli Defense Forces. I cry when I see millions of Palestinian innocent children and women homeless in the midst of the rubbles of their building and houses being bombed. The occupation must end so that everybody can live in peace in their own state.

instagram,"Latest Thoughts on Global Conflict

All war starts inside of men. Men who do not know peace.

If we desire to be free of conflict we must embrace peace within ourselves and see our own addiction to the conflict/drama in our own lives.

It is the addiction of the majority that places world leaders that feed off of that energy. Until we find and share peace to all our brothers and sisters around the world we won‚Äôt know world peace.

We are each responsible and I am working to be aware of and remove any conflict within myself. I desire to lead by example and show others the way to their own peace.

The latest conflict brings great sadness to my heart. It also motivates me to continue being peaceful myself and encouraging others to do the same.

instagram,"‚ÄúIf success or failure of this planet and of human beings depended on how I am and what I do.. how would I be? What would I do? ‚Äî R. Buckminister Fuller. 

So much pain these days, I feel like this year has been incredibly tumultuous for those on the receiving end of oppression. 

What lies at the other side of conflict? 
Can we be futurists and understand the universe as a living system where we get to grief fully, with no shame? 

Can we keep creating art, and re-generative approaches as a mean to find solutions to our wars? 

What type of regenerative design and living systems theory can we put into practice so that we are 100% pro Earth, pro love and community? 

Why are we so divided if our humanities are so similar? 

With these questions in mind, I proudly embark on a journey as one of the artists selected by @designsciencestudio Design Science Studio, an incubator studio that uses the latest technology to heal our ecology, enabling humans to be a net positive to nature. 

Excited to expand, to create and to play. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Just remember: This is not a conflict, it‚Äôs a civil genocide based on the principles of the colonially of occupation.

instagram,"The tragic consequences of conflict are a sombre reminder of the devastating impact war has on vulnerable civilian lives, especially women and girls. On this International Day of the Girl Child, I want to pause, reflecting on the strides we have taken and the obstacles that still lie before us.

It is our collective responsibility to support and protect girls caught in the midst of conflict. Efforts must be made to ensure their safety, access to education, and healthcare services. Empowering girls with knowledge, skills, and opportunities is not only a human rights imperative but also a key factor in building resilient and peaceful societies. We must together strive for a future where every girl can grow up in peace and realize her dreams. #DayOfTheGirlChild #PeaceForAll

Il est de notre responsabilit√© collective de soutenir et de prot√©ger les filles prises au milieu d'un conflit. Des efforts doivent √™tre d√©ploy√©s pour garantir leur s√©curit√©, leur acc√®s √† l'√©ducation et aux services de sant√©. Donner aux filles les moyens d'acqu√©rir des connaissances, des comp√©tences et des opportunit√©s n'est pas seulement un imp√©ratif en mati√®re de droits de l'homme, c'est aussi un facteur cl√© pour construire des soci√©t√©s r√©silientes et pacifiques.

In challenging times like these, when fear attempts to divide us, we are grateful to our comrades leading with revolutionary love, guiding us through these dark times. Today we are sharing the wisdom of @valariekaur, a powerful leader and founder of the @revloveproject üîäüîäüîä

Slides and text by #ValarieKaur

I believe our most powerful response to the horror in Israel and Palestine is to refuse to surrender our humanity.

This is demanding labor. But once your eyes are open ‚Äî you can never again explain away the deaths of children again, like so many are doing right now.

And so:

I stand with the Palestinian people. I stand against the brutal occupation of Palestine and the ongoing subjugation, assaults, and killings of Palestinian people.

I stand against the ongoing antisemitic violence and persecution of Jews, past and present, including the vicious antisemitic attacks right now in the United States.

I have been mourning with Jewish friends who have family in Israel hiding in bomb shelters. And I have been mourning with Palestinian friends whose family in Gaza have no shelters to hide in at all.

My mourning transcends political agendas. Your mourning can too. This is not about equivalency. The time has come to center the human cost of the conflict above all.

Can we stretch our hearts beyond what was previously imaginable? We must if there is to be a world.

The right to resist occupation must be in accordance with international law. The premeditated targeting of civilians by Hamas violates these laws. The bombing of Palestinian civilians in response by the State of Israel violates these laws.

The context of this escalating conflict cannot be ignored. For there to be peace there must be an end to the State of Israel‚Äôs illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories. 

This war will bring pain and grief to so many. All perpetrators must be held accountable for their actions in accordance with international law.

instagram,"More Life returns, and I have some thoughts to share‚Ä¶.

The recent shooting on Saturday cannot be attributed to Bowie State University. It's a reflection of the need for enhanced emotional intelligence and personal accountability within our community.

‚ÄúI can only deal with men who can communicate to solve problems. Who do not harbor passive aggressive feelings and know how to deal with conflict resolution.
Emotional Intelligence is key. Demonstration is the highest form of inspiration.‚Äù

Let's leave behind guns, violence, anger, immaturity, and impulsive reactions ‚Äì especially at my HBCU. And to my fellow HBCU students, let us demonstrate by wearing a reminder so they understand how serious we are; and how much we love our HBCU‚Äôs.

Think before you shoot, and perhaps you'll gain some valuable insights.

instagram,"My country and its people are bleeding, on the 7/10/2023 we saw the face of true evil and barbarism.

The world will never be the same again, and the world must stand with us. If you stay silent about it- know you are in fact supporting Hamas and an anti-semite.
Learn our history. Everyone always say this conflict is difficult to understand, well let me tell you loud and clear, it is VERY SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND.
