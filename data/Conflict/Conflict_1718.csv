Mai grav e cƒÉ am ajuns sƒÉ dezbatem normalitatea √Æn sensul √Æn care fiecare a ajuns sƒÉ justifice orice. BƒÉi, nene, am √Ænnebunit? Nu e de bun sim»õ sƒÉ √Æn»õelegi cƒÉ business-ul tƒÉu nu e NORMAL sƒÉ se clƒÉdeascƒÉ pe disconfortul unei comunitƒÉ»õi √Æntregi? E de notorietate cƒÉ la orice √Ænchiriere de proprietate prin Airbnb se stipuleazƒÉ clar la majoritatea gazdelor: no party. Asta nu doar pentru cƒÉ le e fricƒÉ cƒÉ le distrugi casa (sunt apƒÉra»õi de contract), dar mai ales cƒÉ multe proprietƒÉ»õi trebuie sƒÉ respecte lini»ôtea vecinilor. Dar, na, noi suntem √Æn »õara lui ‚Äúparchez cinci minute »ôi blochez intersec»õia pentru cƒÉ sunt barosan‚Äù Nu e normal sƒÉ dezbatem ceva ce ar trebui sƒÉ fie limpede ca lumina zilei, dar sindromul HerƒÉstrƒÉu este reprezentativ pentru tot ce se √Ænt√¢mplƒÉ √Æn societatea noastrƒÉ: a ajuns normalitate sƒÉ nu avem spitale, sƒÉ nu avem autostrƒÉzi, sƒÉ nu avem servicii medicale, sƒÉ nu avem »ôcoli »ôi educa»õie, sƒÉ nu avem poli»õie »ôi institu»õii care sƒÉ aplice legea iar banii destina»õi tuturor acestor lucruri pe care nu le avem sƒÉ fie prƒÉdui»õi de barosani, de mafia politicƒÉ, aceea»ôi mafie care protejeazƒÉ »ôi ‚Äúterasele‚Äù din HerƒÉstrƒÉu. Aceea»ôi mafie care face posibil ca o judecƒÉtoare din Bucure»ôti sƒÉ nu poatƒÉ justifica o avere de 6 milioane de euro.

FrƒÉ»õia barosan-politician e consfin»õitƒÉ de sprijinul, suportul autoritƒÉ»õilor statului e»ôuat.

El n-are dec√¢t un offshore √Æn Panama »ôi un mic conflict de interese √Æn sensul √Æn care ni»ôte terase din HerƒÉstrƒÉu plƒÉtesc chirie offshore-ului sus men»õionat.

facebook,"We have all been invited in the last few days to join with Archbishop Hosam Naoum and the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, as well as Pope Francis and Archbishop Justin Welby, to pray fervently for all those who have been hurt, harmed, or killed in this conflict. My heart aches when I remember visiting al-Ahli hospital in 2018 during Holy Week to meet the medical teams and all the people of that remarkable ministry. They were passionately committed to anyone who had need. I know personally how faithful Episcopalians are in praying. During my surgery and recovery, you have prayed for me and for my healing, and I am more grateful and thankful than words can say. Right now, I ask you to pray fervently for the birthplace of the Abrahamic faiths and for all its people. Pray for those who have been hurt, harmed, or killed‚Äîregardless of who they are or who did it. Pray also for the leaders and people of the entire region, that they will remember God‚Äôs mercy, and that they will find the way to a just peace where all may live in safety and security as God intends. Pray this week for President Biden, that he may be an advocate for immediate humanitarian access for those who desperately need food, water, and medicine‚Äîand for comfort and consolation for those who have been displaced and those who are grieving loved ones. Please join me in praying: Eternal God, in whose perfect kingdom no sword is drawn but the sword of righteousness, no strength known but the strength of love: So mightily spread abroad your Spirit, that all peoples may be gathered under the banner of the Prince of Peace, as children of one Father; to whom be dominion and glory, now and forever. Amen. Prayers for the World, Book of Common Prayer, p. 815.

facebook,"On this day in 1777, British General John Burgoyne surrenders his army at Saratoga. It was an astounding American victory, and it changed the course of the Revolution! Months earlier, Burgoyne had come to America with a bold mission: His army was supposed to break the back of the American Revolution by cutting off the New England colonies from the southern ones. Unfortunately for the British, Americans chipped away at the size and strength of Burgoyne‚Äôs force during the summer of 1777. Delays caused the British to run low on supplies. Burgoyne won some victories, but he was losing too many men. By October 7, Burgoyne was in a bad position. He had been waiting for reinforcements from General Sir Henry Clinton, but to no avail. He probably should have retreated, but he decided to attack instead. It was a disaster! By the end of the day, the British were badly beaten and retreating toward one of their redoubts. The next day, the British buried one of their fallen leaders at the Great Redoubt. Then they immediately began to retreat north, to an area near Saratoga which had been previously fortified. The retreat was painfully slow, with many stops. Once the British reached their destination, apparently some soldiers were so exhausted that they lay down on the ground and fell asleep in their wet clothes, even as rain fell on top of them. Burgoyne has been criticized for not forcing the retreat further‚Äîand faster! Would he have been able to get away if he had? Americans were slow to begin their pursuit of the British, but they moved quickly once they got started. Before too long, Burgoyne was completely surrounded. On October 13, Burgoyne conceded that he would need to work out terms for a surrender. A few days later, an agreement was finally reached; Burgoyne formally surrendered to Gates on October 17. One British officer later wrote of his experience as he lay down arms. Americans had stayed within their lines, so as not to add to the British humiliation. ‚ÄúI did not observe the least disrespect, or even a taunting look,‚Äù the British officer wrote, ‚Äúbut all was mute astonishment and pity.‚Äù As General Burgoyne handed his sword to American General Horatio Gates, he made a comment that was later reported in various ways. Burgoyne said something to this effect: ‚ÄúThe fortune of war, General Gates, has made me your prisoner.‚Äù Gates responded, simply: ‚ÄúI shall always be ready to bear testimony that it has not been through any fault of your excellency.‚Äù Many historians consider the Battle of Saratoga to be one of the most important battles ever fought. Americans had proven to the world that they could hold their own against the powerful British army! When France learned of the victory, it prodded that country into signing a treaty with us. The Spanish and Dutch would soon also join the effort. The entry of these countries into the conflict made the war more global; thus, British resources had to be stretched even further. Obviously, that could only help us in our own fight for independence. We would finally win that fight almost 4 years to the day after Burgoyne‚Äôs surrender. Stay tuned for the Surrender at Yorktown in two days. :) --------------------------- If you enjoy these history posts, please see my note below. :) Gentle reminder: History posts are copyright ¬© 2013-2023 by Tara Ross.

Umaasa ang liderato nito na sa sama-samang pagsisikap ng mga partner agencies at iba pang stakeholders ng nasabing programa, ay matulungan ang mga dating conflict-affected areas sa probinsya na magkaroon ng pangmatagalang kapayapaan.

True victory is achieved through awareness, awareness, and acceptance of others. This victory remains and lasts and puts an end to imaginary victories. The conflict does not end unless you agree.

facebook,"‚ÄúGiggles‚Äù In the heart of the Enchanted Forest, where the leaves whispered secrets and the flowers danced to the rhythm of the wind, there lived a faerie named Giggles. Giggles was unlike any other faerie in the forest, for she possessed a unique gift. She treated laughter as the most potent healing balm. Giggles had a contagious laugh that could brighten the darkest of days. Her wings shimmered like a rainbow, and her eyes sparkled with mischief. She understood the magic of laughter, the way it could mend even the deepest wounds and bridge the widest gaps. One day, a great sadness befell the Enchanted Forest. A bitter feud had erupted between the sprites and the gnomes over a patch of enchanted mushrooms. The forest was no longer harmonious, and the once-lively creatures now wore somber expressions. Giggles decided it was time to put her extraordinary gift to use. She fluttered down to where the sprites and gnomes were locked in an argument and began to giggle. At first, they stared at her, puzzled and a bit annoyed. But Giggles persisted, her laughter growing more infectious by the moment. Slowly, a sprite couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle, and a gnome‚Äôs stern face broke into a smile. Giggles‚Äô laughter spread like wildfire, and soon, all the creatures, sprites and gnomes alike, were laughing together. As the laughter filled the forest, something magical happened. The mushrooms, which had been the source of the conflict, began to glow with a radiant light. The forest itself seemed to vibrate with joy, and the discord melted away. Giggles had brought balance to the Enchanted Forest through her broad perspective and the power of laughter. She showed everyone that even the most challenging situations could be eased with a good dose of humor and a shared laugh. From that day on, Giggles became the forest‚Äôs peacemaker. She traveled far and wide, bringing her laughter to every corner of the enchanted realm, healing rifts, and renewing friendships. The Enchanted Forest, once again, thrived in harmony, all thanks to the faerie named Giggles, who believed that laughter was the most powerful magic of all.",,2121,"{'like_count': 1463, 'comment_count': 41, 'num_users': 39355}",Fairytails,,2023-10-17 12:09:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/304937072_122423797227117_6031807070512044882_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xF3gI0p3TQQAX8BTs6a&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAw8w9voOgJzlMcBcHNoZMpN7jhnboa_MjtP6GjiC7N4w&oe=6559D244,https://www.facebook.com/100083784900507/posts/294913376644824,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391604795_294913263311502_7448044330595014394_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=X8zziWeeze8AX_HuvcL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBEMF1kks6a9vOu6oX9XjvgyGTMNaiM68RA51_oPrDfKQ&oe=6533811B

facebook,"üó£Xavier Bosch: ""In 2017, the great Juan Carlos Unzue warned Neymar in Barcelona training: 'If you continue like this, you will end up like Ronaldinho.' He could not be more right; Neymar ended up even worse than Ronaldinho. He did not succeed at PSG, had conflict with their fans, and now finds himself outside of the elite in Saudi Arabia. He earned a lot of money in his career, but zero important individual awards. With his injuries, parties, and other shenanigans, Neymar completely wasted his enormous talent. It was even proven three times this week, where he insulted the Brazilian Federation president, threatened not to play the next match, and had a private party with three women before their last match... in the same week that he became a father again.

facebook,"Israel Rebelled Against God ((( 2 STRONG ))) In today's video, we tackle the age-old conflict between Israel and Palestine from an angle rarely explored: faith and divine principles. As rockets fly and peace treaties crumble, the question arises: Have both nations abandoned God, or has God abandoned them? Drawing from Biblical texts and modern-day narratives, we delve into how the consequences of disobedience and rebellion manifest in geopolitical tensions. This is not just another update on the Middle East; it's a dissection of the role faith plays in war and peace. Tune in for a thought-provoking analysis you won't find anywhere else.

facebook,"It is so great we are having conversations about the mental load... There has been so much chat about my interview the other day in which Fitzy & Wippa With Kate Ritchie and I talked about the mental load. Unfortunately, when you get a 90sec grab from a longer conversation some of the nuance can be missed so I really wanted to just post a bit more about that here. First of all I want to clarify that while I mention in this grab that women's tendency to worry about a whole lot of things is biological, that isn't the WHOLE story. As I have written in several of my books, gender is more fluid than fixed, and while respecting biological, neurological and hormonal differences, there is not an ‚Äòall men‚Äô or ‚Äòall women‚Äô reality. ON TOP OF THAT, there is social conditioning that is deeply embedded in culture and ancestry. Women are socially conditioned to take care of others and be people pleasers, as I write in my book Girlhood. Just as men are conditioned to be protectors and the strong, silent types. It's not about blaming and shaming each other -- as this story on The Project illustrates well, this conditioning creates a lot of silent expectations on mums and dads, so it can cause conflict. Hopefully having these conversations is about creating greater understanding of what might be at play here so we can then challenge it and parent together better. Thanks to those who have messaged telling us about some great conversations happening and plans to ease the mental load of many mammas. Also, I know that many dads worry about their kids - of course they do! Statistics indicate though that women are more prone to anxious thinking than men. Some research has shown, too, that women are more likely to ruminate than men. And, what I was pointing out to Kate in the Nova interview was not to say that women love their kids more than men. Or that worry makes a better parent... This is just a dynamic that commonly plays out in a lot of heterosexual relationships. And it can create conflict, which could be resolved with honest, real conversations. This chat has obviously struck a chord about potential challenges for those practising ‚Äòteam parenting' and that's a good thing! Exploring how to be the dad you want to be - especially if you had an old school dad - is certainly something some of the dads I've interviewed for the LiSTNR podcast, The Good Enough Dad, have been talking about. And I look forward to hearing more from them to keep this conversation going.",,1559,"{'like_count': 900, 'comment_count': 145, 'num_users': 350698}",Maggie Dent,,2023-10-17 23:36:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/187624762_343902543757463_7179068838620618898_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=2t6_VWipvogAX-REC3S&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAle7HbZrEqWLPssXyQRePWAcx9BDuCd0F0yaaVEsCgag&oe=657D24D8,https://www.facebook.com/100044131613227/posts/885706306243748,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/16929682905930515522?url=https%3A%2F%2F10play.com.au%2Fip%2Fvs%2FOTFP%2Fbd084e7b2af6b87c975fbf4bb0acb1294b495f2fa1df72bae23151d4bafb2a03%2FResearch%2520Shows%2520Mums%2520Spend%2520More%2520Time%2520Worrying%2520Than%2520Dads-thumbnail.jpeg%3Fimage-profile%3Dimage_full%26io%3Dlandscape&fb_obo=1&utld=10play.com.au&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbGfae7anoF9mfHVOKMD8JuFCbDbY3zjjF07ENQCKqBBfQ&oe=65479174

facebook,"I am a ""warrior of light"", but don't forget that that title starts with warrior. This picture was taken after 4 days of fighting Hamas terrorists in the Kfar Aza, one of hardest hit communities on the border of Gaza that was annihilated by the terrorists, moments before our unit‚Äôs arrival. In front of me is the Kotz family house, one of the countless families that were executed and who‚Äôs bodies were found lifeless, yet still embracing each other in their last moments. Their next door neighbors were also a family of 5, where the two parents were shot dead, but two of the daughters were hidden in a closet and later found and saved by IDF special forces. Unfortunately, the third child who‚Äôs a baby is still missing. Many are trying to deny the savagery and gruesome slaughter that took place in these communities, but I saw it first hand. Hundreds of bodies shot, stabbed, burn, blown up, dragged and cut to pieces are seared in my memory for eternity. This not only happened, but it‚Äôs worse than you can ever imagine. Woman were rapped with objects to death as Hamas lit their babies on fire in front of them. There was no mercy here. There was no humanity here. There are still around 200 civilians kidnapped and trapped in Gaza, men, women, elderly and children, and who knows what‚Äôs happening to them. Am Israel is here to bring light into this world, but it‚Äôs time to clear the storm for the sun to shine bright again. Israelis & Palestinians do not deserve the consequences of evil forces that drive those who make decisions, profit from conflict, and push hateful rhetoric that make people lose their consciousness. Am Israel is here to be a light onto the nations and I work daily to fulfill this purpose, but if we‚Äôre forced to fight off a virus like Hamas to make sure life and light can exist, then we will. May the memory of all those fallen be blessed and may the life of all those still standing be empowered to rise to our chosen role.",,1345,"{'like_count': 601, 'comment_count': 248, 'num_users': 237990}",Rudy Rochman ◊®◊ï◊ì◊ô ◊®◊ï◊©◊û◊ü,,2023-10-17 04:44:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/179820541_313120300184801_2819944058770765989_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=PM1PrtqQg5YAX-9ePMh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDed0KfQTwJgiEyJC9CR1ZOKSFE5sKhm9Y-sh24_tFdtw&oe=657D194F,https://www.facebook.com/100044604991757/posts/872982620865230,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391752395_18304001074189290_2515506596690140142_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=G2gsVdmJxMIAX_KEnwD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDuLxqYgv9v5W4R7AjxZ7OWxI_PNpZfXeY7xaU9euinPg&oe=655ABA8A

facebook,"‚ñ™Ô∏èAlmost everyone (including many libertarians) approaches the Israeli/Palestinian conflict wrong. They view it as a disagreement over tribal, collective ‚Äúrights‚Äù to the land. The Jews have historical claim, Palestinian land was stolen, blah blah. There is no such thing as collective, tribal rights to land, that thinking is what has led to most wars throughout history. There‚Äôs only a right to the land particular individuals own, or have cultivated. ‚ñ™Ô∏èVery few Palestinians living today have any legitimate property rights claim to land in Israel. More importantly, that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre fighting for. #FreePalestine is not a movement to protect the individual rights of Palestinians (or anyone), it‚Äôs a movement to install a dictatorship, a theocracy that controls ‚ÄúPalestinian land.‚Äù Not only is there no right for such a dictatorship to exist, any movement which seeks to implement one is not in any way associated with freedom. ‚ñ™Ô∏èEvery single time Palestinians have been given autonomy and the ability to self rule they have chosen dictatorships and authoritarianism. There are no rights of any kind in Gaza. No freedom of speech, religion, or property rights. If they controlled more land, it would mean more oppression, not only for Israelis but for Palestinians. ‚ñ™Ô∏èIsrael, meanwhile, is a crappy government like the US is a crappy government. It does all sorts of awful things, but it protects basic freedoms. You can be gay in Israel, be a Muslim, be an entrepreneur, be critical of the govt, etc. You can pursue your dreams for the most part. In fact, Arabs living in Israel are far freer (and better off) than those in Gaza or most anywhere else in the Middle East. ‚ñ™Ô∏èNo state who violates any of the rights of its citizens deserves to exist, but in reality this only applies if the alternative is more freedom. Freedom movements are only moral or justified if they call for and actually bring more freedom to an area. The Palestinian cause does not, it only brings tribal rule with a genocidal desire to erase Israel. ‚ñ™Ô∏èIt doesn‚Äôt matter what the historical claims of the Jewish or Palestinian people are (although the Jews have a better claim even there imo). It matters what government is better at protecting its citizens‚Äô rights. In that regard, it‚Äôs not even close in who to support. It‚Äôs night and day morally. It takes brainwashing or a college degree to rationalize supporting ‚ÄúPalestinian freedom‚Äù in the current context.",,1176,"{'like_count': 641, 'comment_count': 277, 'num_users': 50317}",The Meme Policeman,,2023-10-17 17:11:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/351861548_272839615309864_8916229345855712831_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=1o_IC0C0WQsAX_U2xRh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDzFk8NeoIwcudjttel_kORc3JkabPo0pigvHwvpDTL5w&oe=6559F55A,https://www.facebook.com/100066732032665/posts/679217314312664,

facebook,"On this day in 1955, a star was born who would light up the world of Indian parallel cinema with her immense talent and captivating presence. Smita Patil was an icon of art cinema committed to women's causes. A short career with an incredibly long impact. That, in one line, is Smita Patil, the stunning actress whose intensity redefined women's role in Indian cinema for just over 10 years. By the time she died at the heartbreaking young age of 31, Smita was recognised India's finest actress, as one of the leading lights of New Wave Cinema of the mid-1970s. Smita Patil's landmark films defined the Indian woman with far more complexity, with the way she showed the inner conflict of the characters she portrayed without holding back or playing for safety. In her we see courage to live with contradictions, the combination of vulnerability and strength. She went on to be part of the iconic quartet of art cinema -- Smita Patil, Shabana Azmi, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri. She looked down on commercial movies even when she was doing them. Her notable films include Bhumika, Nishant, Manthan, Umbartha, Bazaar, Tarang, Akaler, Chakra, Arth, Aakrosh, Mirch Masala to even a mainstream woman's melodrama like Akhir Kyon? and Amrit.",,1093,"{'like_count': 874, 'comment_count': 58, 'num_users': 61829}",Timeless Indian Melodies (Group),,2023-10-17 07:51:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/398755510_733238968840437_1937724028297744391_n.jpg?stp=c0.4.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ioR6v5XOMEoAX-mMKff&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC6XzrYezPoScWmlVaWECUtEan5XSrI-83Yc7cD11EN8A&oe=6559C797,https://www.facebook.com/groups/370153336951055/permalink/1351308732168839,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392925626_1043754356662244_7541834030760435107_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=_Drn6Rf0L7UAX_v08-G&_nc_oc=AQkY-XOWOEgqxUJVKYU9aHLpW6tymOi_7ST0N2NHeOhRKTtFRAhEVw8EQ1fUJPlNCYM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBDE68HlV6gcyptBJN9reWNnazMIL2HNVi3vitT8DlnCw&oe=6532949E

facebook,"Elder's Meditation of the Day - October 17 ""Peace... comes within the souls of men when they realize their relationship, their oneness, with the universe and all its powers, and when they realize that at the center of the Universe dwells Wakan-Tanka, and that this center is really everywhere, it is within each of us."" -- Black Elk (Hehaka Sapa) OGLALA SIOUX If we are to know peace we must look within ourselves. In order to do this, we must learn to be still. We must quiet the mind. We must learn to meditate. Meditation helps us locate and find the center that is within ourselves. The center is where the Great One resides. When we start to look for peace, we need to realize where it is within ourselves. When we experience conflict we need to pause for a moment and ask the Power within ourselves, ""How do you want me to handle this? What would you suggest I do in this situation?"" By asking the Higher Power for help we find peace. Creator, help me to find peace.

facebook,"How to strengthen your loving relationship...‚úç Everyone‚Äôs relationship is unique, and people come together for many different reasons. But there are some things that good relationships have in common. Knowing the basic principles of healthy relationships helps keep them meaningful, fulfilling and exciting in both happy times and sad: So what makes a healthy love relationship? 1. Staying involved with each other... Some relationships get stuck in peaceful coexistence, but without truly relating to each other and working together. While it may seem stable on the surface, lack of involvement and communication increases distance. When you need to talk about something important, the connection and understanding may no longer be there. 2. Getting through conflict... Some couples talk things out quietly, while others may raise their voices and passionately disagree. The key in a strong relationship, though, is not to be fearful of conflict. You need to be safe to express things that bother you without fear of retaliation, and be able to resolve conflict without humiliation, degradation or insisting on being right. 3. Keeping outside relationships and interests alive... No one person can meet all of our needs, and expecting too much from someone can put a lot of unhealthy pressure on a relationship. Having friends and outside interests not only strengthens your social network, but brings new insights and stimulation to the relationship, too. 4. Communicating... Honest, direct communication is a key part of any relationship. When both people feel comfortable expressing their needs, fears, and desires, trust and bonds are strengthened. Nonverbal cues‚Äîbody language like eye contact, leaning forward or away, or touching someone‚Äôs arm‚Äîare critical to communication.",,662,"{'like_count': 426, 'comment_count': 41, 'num_users': 507915}",Thoughts of Jacktone,,2023-10-17 04:37:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338001205_1368720427298146_7411246640499111275_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y2RUnb3oDQYAX-HSA0u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBqyqTelr8rLeEt81yumQygWi0FvjjsEBUdmYP8UoZ7VA&oe=655B2E12,https://www.facebook.com/100064148888578/posts/723523303129293,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391626785_723523156462641_2411319508082598626_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=pr0pJeZto2MAX_dAnLI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBAyVDGhmgHwNoSp0B3y6ph2Q4FYnyiqdXwgQBfQmXOGQ&oe=6533054C

facebook,"In the Israel-Gaza conflict, women in Israel have assumed more prominent roles within the Israel Defense Forces. Over 55,000 women are serving, and an impressive 92 percent of military positions are now accessible to them. These female soldiers have made substantial contributions to various aspects of the IDF's operations. Among the remarkable women in the IDF is Ella Waweya, who made history by becoming the first Muslim Arab woman to publicly announce her promotion to Major in the IDF. She uses her platform to provide updates on the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Additionally, Moriah Mencer, a former IDF soldier, returned to Israel to join the front lines following a personal tragedy. This evolution reflects a transformative path for the IDF. Where women were initially relegated to support roles they now actively engage in various aspects of the conflict, including front-line service, journalism, and medical assistance. #IsraelPalestineConflict #Palestine",,609,"{'like_count': 51, 'comment_count': 442, 'num_users': 370630}",International Business Times UK,,2023-10-17 15:15:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352816154_592502959649068_2925267219161788613_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=l3aFONf_yswAX_6Qhhu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDVxr2JVcYOpNYld7wnQe5FHAG4GJ5NrnuMj9Up_NOASA&oe=6559C384,https://www.facebook.com/100066681074118/posts/662304726002224,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391653218_662304762668887_2166785878825352479_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=F5GjYds7VXUAX-vhWsJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCADEyMAWxVakIGk4ksXTacmpKvhQ7NTeLg9VwrXUhiNA&oe=6559E120

facebook,"The Council of Nicaea, also known as the First Council of Nicaea, was a major event in early Christian history. It took place in 325 AD in the city of Nicaea, which is now known as Iznik in modern-day Turkey. The council was convened by the Roman Emperor Constantine I, who sought to resolve a theological dispute that was causing division within the Christian Church. The problem that led to the Council of Nicaea was primarily centered around the teachings of two influential figures: Arius and Alexander of Alexandria. Arius was a presbyter (priest) from Alexandria, Egypt, who challenged the accepted Christian doctrine regarding the nature of Jesus Christ. He believed that Jesus was a created being, separate and subordinate to God the Father. This idea came to be known as Arianism. On the other hand, Alexander, the bishop of Alexandria, held the orthodox belief that Jesus was of the same substance (homoousios) as God the Father, fully divine and co-eternal. He saw Arius' teachings as heretical and a threat to the unity of the Church. The controversy sparked by Arius' teachings ended up dividing the Christian community, causing a significant rupture within the Church. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Emperor Constantine summoned the Council of Nicaea to address the dispute and bring unity back to the Church. Roughly 250 to 300 bishops attended the council, and they engaged in intense theological debates over the nature of Jesus. After several weeks of discussions and arguments, the council ultimately voted in favor of Alexander's position, refuting Arius' teachings. They formulated what is known as the Nicene Creed, which established the orthodox belief that Jesus is of the same substance as God the Father (homoousios) and declared Arianism as heretical. The council's decision had far-reaching implications. It not only resolved the immediate conflict between Arius and Alexander but also established a foundation for the future theological development of Christianity. The Nicene Creed became a crucial statement of belief for the Church, and its teachings on the divinity of Jesus continue to form an essential part of Christian theology today. The Council of Nicaea is significant not only for its theological outcomes but also for its historical impact. It represents a key moment in the relationship between the Christian Church and the Roman Empire, as it marked the first time a Roman emperor called for and presided over a council of bishops. It also laid the groundwork for subsequent ecumenical councils, which played a critical role in shaping Christian doctrine and resolving doctrinal disputes throughout history. Keep in mind that the Council of Nicaea took place prior to the composition of the New Testament.",,543,"{'like_count': 202, 'comment_count': 252, 'num_users': 213872}",Igbo History,,2023-10-17 19:10:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/307184859_473511928019350_4742560681478295685_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=88ZmnwIhHRIAX9TB5jH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfArl5IGBO-TrD60eLG4blZ_i1KfN4PFlaKNsfpBQkNWGg&oe=6559FDD7,https://www.facebook.com/100066676973079/posts/667097682189458,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393910876_667097642189462_6284479163610946600_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=73Alr4GQQEsAX-mrtR5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDL0HBMBxd_QotrF8491bgkHzOnO7Ns0A1j8qKfYYRxiw&oe=6534903F

This is very much appreciated, especially as social media has been an important link in the last few years and my main way of keeping up with everyone‚Äôs lives. ‚ù§Ô∏è Today someone asked me for my birthday wish. Aside from a wonderful life, it‚Äôs really world peace and quick resolutions to so much conflict in many regions. The past two weeks have been heartbreaking for everyone in the Middle East and I pray for the safety of civilians on both sides of this truly complicated issue. Then there are all the people who have been affected or displaced in some way by the pandemic. So many lives were overturned by COVID and I hope that everyone in sad or unhappy situations soon finds reasons to smile again.

facebook,"It was a couple of years ago now that members of the Animals Australia team met ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÑÿ© - Sulala Animal Rescue Founder and Director Saeed, and recognised in him extraordinary courage, commitment, and compassion for animals despite living in one of the most challenging circumstances in Gaza. As a result, we support Sulala‚Äôs efforts for animals through our Emergency Grants Program. When we usually meet with Saeed, it‚Äôs to hear updates about rescues his team has attended, animal welfare training for local community groups or how individual animals have been recovering from treatment. This week though, contact has been fleeting, worried messages as the news of war broke last weekend. We have been trying to get a daily understanding of what it means for him, his family and the many hundreds of animals in his care on the ground in Gaza. Saeed has been remarkably calm as this unimaginable situation unfolds and his concerns are focused on his community of animals and people around him. This is typical of the Saeed we know. We need to be honest and tell you that we don‚Äôt know what is going to happen tomorrow, or in the coming days and weeks for Saeed and the animals. Nobody does. Right now, we know that he and his family achieved an extraordinary feat and managed to move all the cats and dogs out of the evacuation zone where they were living. As a result, the hundreds of animals in Sulala‚Äôs care are still safe and cared for. Our ongoing emergency grant has helped purchase food for the animals, but this supply is limited. Each day we have been sending Saeed messages conveying how much the Animals Australia team, our donors, and this incredible community care about him and his selfless compassion. Communication is difficult because the power and internet access in Gaza has been cut for days now. But he is grateful and feeling supported from afar from a community united by kindness. There are so many unknowns as to what will unfold in coming days and so much that is beyond Saeed‚Äôs control. But we will be standing by, continuing to support Sulala, and the animals in their care, in whatever way we can as the situation becomes clearer. If you would like to donate, please be assured that your generosity will be directed to our response in Gaza: https://animalsaus.co/46S5geR:=:https://animalsaustralia.org/appeal/donate-to-emergency-grants-for-gaza/ We promise we will do everything within our power to help them.

facebook,"With GTNP's grizzly #610's recent hit-and-run encounter still front of mind, we'd like to take the opportunity to give a shout-out to our wildlife ambassadors on Togwotee Pass, which has its own roadside grizzlies and where our ambassadors work to keep these animals from becoming too comfortable with people and vehicles. Getting habituated to humans can make bears more comfortable exploring campgrounds and other developed areas. If bears get into human-related foods in those areas, wildlife managers are much more likely to relocate or kill grizzlies to prevent conflict. And of course getting habituated to cars is also a problem--vehicle strikes are a common cause of bear deaths. Whether along a road or in the backcountry, please stay at least 100 yards (about 100 paces) from bears.

We decree God's peace and blessing rests upon Israel and Jerusalem. We declare peace to her borders and that all enemy fire shall cease. We ask for angelic reinforcements to bring protection to the walls of Israel and that its places of government shall remain safe. We break the power of all dread, fear, and terror among the people. We say they shall not fear attacks, bombings, missiles, and foreign invasion. We prophesy that their homes, streets, businesses, and historical sites shall be protected. We declare that Israel's land shall remain secure, and no politicians or governments of the earth shall be able to enact agreements or accords that take their land away. We say that Jerusalem belongs to God. We speak strength to the state of Israel. We prophesy that a prosperity from the Lord rests upon it and the Jewish people. Israel belongs to God and Israel is forever. We declare that the Gospel of Jesus Christ shall shine in Israel and many shall come to the way of salvation. May the United States of America never break its alliance with Israel. We bind every effort by the government to detach from Israel, and we declare that America shall always defend Israel and seek its good. We pray for the defeat and destruction of Islamist terrorist invaders. We pray for the physical rescue of Israelis under siege, those who are kidnapped, those who are wounded. We pray for divine wisdom and decisive strategy to be given to Israel's leaders in every area. We pray that God will break the arrows and bow of the enemy, and for supernatural protection for Israel against all rockets and missile attacks from God and his angels. We pray that Israel‚Äôs enemies will be confused and will turn and flee. We pray for salvation and revival to break out in Israel. We pray that they would come to know Jesus as their true Messiah. We pray that their eyes would be opened to see the love and light of Jesus in the middle of their darkest hour. God we declare that this conflict will not escalate into World War 3. We declare that it will end quickly and every attempt of the enemy to turn it into something more is cancelled in Jesus‚Äô name. We pray for peace in Israel and worldwide.

facebook,"Elder's Meditation of the Day October 17

""Peace... comes within the souls of men when they realize their relationship, their oneness, with the universe and all its powers, and when they realize that at the center of the Universe dwells Wakan-Tanka, and that this center is really everywhere, it is within each of us.""
--Black Elk (Hehaka Sapa) OGLALA SIOUX 

If we are to know peace we must look within ourselves. In order to do this, we must learn to be still. We must quiet the mind. We must learn to meditate. Meditation helps us locate and find the center that is within ourselves. The center is where the Great One resides. When we start to look for peace, we need to realize where it is within ourselves. When we experience conflict we need to pause for a moment and ask the Power within ourselves, ""How do you want me to handle this? What would you suggest I do in this situation?"" By asking the Higher Power for help we find peace.

Creator, help me to find peace.

facebook,"BE THE REASON YOUR PARTNER BELIEVES IN LOVE Many people do not believe there is something called love; some think marriage is a scam while others believe relationships are just business. All these people have a valid reason or ground for such a position or belief. Their last experience of love, relationship or marriage gave them such beliefs. The truth is, true love exists, marriage is real and good and there are healthy relationships where partners seek for the interests, needs and wellbeing of each other. Relationships don't just happen, they are built. The fact that you had a bad experience with someone in the past does not mean every relationship will end as such. Learn to give the people you love room and support to become what God created them to be. Whatever they are created to be, give them wings to fly. Identify the potentials they have, empower and encourage them to pursue that. Don't let your fear or insecurity get in between your relationship. If you cannot be wings for your partner to fly with but your action rather limits them and makes them depend on you for everything, then your relationship is not a loving relationship but slavery. Be a home they can come to no matter where they travel or fly to. Create a safe space or environment they can always come to. Be a partner they can always talk to on anything. A place devoid of violence and abuse. Your words and arms should bring comfort and not pain. A place they feel protected and cared for. Make time to resolve conflict and maintain peace. Be there for them, a shoulder to lean on, arm to carry them. Love them the way they are instead of trying to change them into your Ex or your crush. The way you treat them will make them stay with you. And when they do, you become the reason they believe in love, you become a reason they want to marry. In conclusion, ""Treat others the same way you want them to treat you"" - Luke 6:31 (AMP). Please share it with your friends. Someone out there needs this.

facebook,"Gurpatwant Singh Pannun leader of the banned group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Pannun is part of the Khalistan movement, which wants to create a separate Sikh country away from India. While the violence in India reduced in the 1990s, the movement still has support from some people living outside India. Amritsar-born Pannun has been under the National Investigation Agency's (NIA) investigation since 2019 when the agency filed its first case against him. Pannun, who lives in Canada, was named as a wanted terrorist in 2020. He is facing more than 20 criminal counts in Punjab. He has threatened Prime Minister Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar on numerous occasions. He is accused of being a key figure in promoting and organizing terrorist actions, as well as causing fear and terror in Punjab and other regions of India through threats and intimidation strategies. He has been called a Khalistani terrorist. You all may know that there are severe problems between India and Canada. Incase you have missed it, you can watch this video for the full story. Last month, Gurpatwant Pannun had published a video asking Indians to leave Canada. In the video, Pannun was heard saying, ‚ÄúIndo-Hindu leave Canada; go to India. You not only support India but you are also supporting the suppression of speech and expression of pro-Khalistan Sikhs"". In recent months, there have been several attacks on Hindu temples and Sikh leaders in Punjab. The Indian government has blamed the SFJ for these attacks. The Ahmedabad police recently registered an FIR against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun over his threat to disrupt a World Cup match between India and Pakistan to be held at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Gujarat. Now just days before the scheduled India-Pakistan ICC World Cup 2023 match in Ahmedabad, Gujarat Pannun released a video. In the video, he warns Prime Minister Narendra Modi to watch and learn from the Israel-Palestine conflict, other he will plan a Hamas like attack in India. Pannun stated that people in areas under illegal control, like Punjab and Palestine, will respond, and violence can lead to more violence. Pannun also mentioned that if India keeps what he considers as ""occupying"" Punjab, there will be a response, and he holds India and PM Modi responsible for it. He mentioned that SFJ supports the idea of ""voting and elections"" and believes that the ""liberation of Punjab"" is possible. ""India, the choice is yours: ballot or bullet"", Pannun says in the video while making a shooting gesture at the camera. The message also stated that SFJ would seek ""revenge"" for the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijar in Canada. According to the Cyber Crime DCP of Ahmedabad, Ajit Rajian, pre-recorded threatening messages from Pannun were distributed on various social media accounts. #gurpatwantsinghpannu #khalistan #hamasattack #NIA #ICCWorldCup2023 #israelpalestineconflict #BreakingNews #WorldNews #LatestNews #IndiaSigningHands #ISH #ISHNews #ISL #IndianSignLanguage #SignLanguage #Information #India #Deaf #DeafCulture #DeafCommunity #Awareness #DeafAwareness #IndiaDeaf #DeafIndia #News #NewsChannel #DailyNews #DailyNewsIndia #NewsAlert",,392,"{'like_count': 373, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 83267}",ISH News,,2023-10-17 10:27:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/286387992_405969241542728_8280908256485874306_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=X0k7qHOBhd4AX-F4TTZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCgxpIP7CGyEiW-IeEHAxUbWosXXyfqB0JRn9_NoOG6lA&oe=655B55EF,https://www.facebook.com/100063889671981/posts/747161290756853,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393692223_1038190853999698_7816619801475923551_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=eADIflnAo80AX-5aC7i&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC1yqEqo2ZiN-ZHBmkmx474EaWtqrNKNIcYaGYjHy-Vow&oe=6532EAA8

facebook,"‚ù§Ô∏èFAITH ADOPTED!‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏èü§çüíôVeteran's Faithful Friend Needs a Loving Home‚ù§Ô∏èü§çüíô Meet Faith, a loyal and loving 7-year-old canine companion who has been a constant source of comfort and support to her veteran father. Through the highs and lows of life, Faith has stood by his side, offering unwavering love and companionship. However, her dad is currently going through a life transition that necessitates his full focus on personal health and well-being, making it necessary to find Faith a new, loving home. In her Vetaran üá∫üá∏ Dad's own words: ""This dog has saved my life on multiple occasions, from battling depression to alerting me to a house fire. She is the best thing that has happened to me since I left the military. Unfortunately, I can no longer provide her a home. Anyone fortunate enough to welcome her into their life would be truly blessed."" While we may not have formal certification, Faith's dad made it clear that she has been his emotional support throughout their journey together. Her loyalty and love have been a beacon of hope in his life, and we are honored that he has entrusted us with the responsibility of finding Faith a new, caring home. Faith spent some time in a wonderful foster home, but she encountered a situation where she engaged in a conflict with the foster's dog. This experience might have been due to the changes she has undergone recently. To ensure her long-term happiness and well-being, we are seeking an adoptive home without other pets. ‚ù§Ô∏èFaith is equally content indoors and outdoors. ü§çShe is well-trained, responding to commands like ""sit, stay, lay down, and come."" üíôShe enjoys car rides, relaxing on the couch, and quiet moments. ‚ù§Ô∏èHer activity level is moderate, and she's an easy dog to care for. ü§çFaith exhibits great house manners and is trustworthy when left alone. Contact Us: If you are interested in learning more about Faith, meeting her in person, and potentially providing her with a forever home, please reach out to us at lorrie@shelterdogproject.org. Faith is located in Palm Beach County, Florida. Faith is a wonderful and loving dog who has enriched her owner's life in countless ways. We believe that there is a special family or individual out there who will appreciate her loyalty and cherish her as a beloved member of their home. Thank you for considering giving Faith a new, loving home.",,381,"{'like_count': 52, 'comment_count': 44, 'num_users': 6409}",Palm Beach Shelter Dog Project,,2023-10-17 23:00:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/278924585_323584373210997_4039003389267077666_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EH9e1Z3zWlAAX9ouGLT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDByjkSxFAQCurERNdDb6Lo38jpEgEIcp7jLqOLwtKi7w&oe=655B7BF7,https://www.facebook.com/100066783096511/posts/656454579923973,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393497246_656407953261969_1352928681931926056_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mb5WGmXiOS4AX8UEhow&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAJEuucI_l7uaEcQsXY6w2qQaXTeTs2QULwWpxkur1UUA&oe=6558F68F

facebook,"Government officials are warning of a rising threat of terror attacks in the United States since Hamas attacked Israel a week ago. FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters it's possible that Hamas and other terror groups could call on their supporters to carry out attacks on U.S. soil. ""The threat is very much ongoing and in fact, the threat picture continues to evolve,"" Wray said. ""Here in the U.S., we cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or other foreign terrorist organizations could exploit the conflict to call on their supporters to conduct attacks on our own soil."" In a call with reporters, Wray warned there has been an increase in reported threats, and Jews and Muslims alike as well as their institutions and houses of worship have been threatened, CBS News reports. He said the bureau is ""moving quickly to mitigate"" the threats adding that security officials are also on the lookout for ""lone actors"" who might commit violence on their own. ***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.*** Terrorism experts have told CBN News Hamas and Hezbollah sleeper cells are operating within the United States. And a comprehensive study by George Washington University last year found the most Hezbollah activity in Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and California. Former FBI Special Agent Eric Caron, now a security and counter-terrorism consultant to governments, told CBN News, ""We have over a thousand joint terrorism task force cases going on here in America today relating to Muslim extremists."" This year, authorities have caught 151 people on the FBI's Terrorism Watch list trying to illegally enter the U.S. through the southern border, 50 times higher than two years ago. ""The idea that they don't want to attack us again like a 9-11, but even bigger is foolish. They want to attack us.

The government coalition, Pacto Hist√≥rico, urged a ceasefire and declared it ‚Äúfully supports Colombia's new foreign policy that advocates respect for the free self-determination of peoples.‚Äù Pacto Hist√≥rico added: ‚ÄúWe reject the attempt to force Colombia to renounce the denunciation of the disproportionate use of force by the State of Israel [...] and avoid the announced genocide of the people of Palestine.‚Äù #GazaGenocide #DismantleApartheid https://loom.ly/b-q5Q7g:=:https://brazilian.report/liveblog/latam/2023/10/16/israel-colombia-diplomatic-spat/ https://loom.ly/1q49GMk:=:https://www.resumenlatinoamericano.org/2023/10/15/colombia-si-hay-que-suspender-relaciones-exteriores-con-israel-las-suspendemos/",,347,"{'like_count': 224, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 220915}","Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement",,2023-10-17 13:31:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/347129586_777558970419958_2038489734418513082_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LjOsFz8SVoAAX_MXmOI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCe7bu-KxCdkaXJmpvt5BWirI9BvQy5y2NmHT0LniVNRg&oe=6559DB5B,https://www.facebook.com/100064830992942/posts/706601538177540,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/438257566707175856?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrazilian.report%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F10%2FTBR-PHOTOS-2023-10-16T114123.472.png&fb_obo=1&utld=brazilian.report&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbENlQEyZ2pC1A2orPexdjqwoGk1Ei_xqlirBAOwekm-Zw&oe=654FD312

facebook,"MILLIONAIRE EMBRACE | Tuesday, 17th October 2023 Korede & Esther Komaiya The Power For Total Restoration And Recovery (Pt. 2) ‚ÄúYes, if you forgive others for the things they do wrong, then your Father in heaven will also forgive you for the things you do wrong.‚Äù Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠6‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠14‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠(ICB‚Ä¨‚Ä¨) As much as total restoration and recovery are the will of God for every believer, you need the empowerment of the Spirit to appropriate them in your life. You need to be empowered to experience restoration. Today, many believers find themselves lacking power, and in Christianity, power is essential because, without it, it will be mere religion. As discussed yesterday, one of the main reasons for this power deficiency is the failure to grasp the profound impact of forgiveness. Forgiveness is the ultimate key to a life filled with power. Unforgiveness leads to power failure and inflicts more harm than the devil ever could. It is the mother of losses and setbacks. As seen in our anchor text, unforgiveness causes conflict and creates obstacles in your relationship with God. God‚Äôs response to you is hinged on your response to others when they do you wrong. How you treat people who offend you shows who you are to God. Therefore, unforgiveness will undermine your connection with God and set you against those who could assist you. One's ability to forgive quickly is a clear indicator of their knowledge of God. Unforgiveness is an authentic evidence that you aren't growing as a Christian and that you lack the nature of God. When you know how to initiate forgiveness, you know God. A forgiving person has the power to enforce effortless dominion in their life. Anywhere there is unforgiveness, God‚Äôs power for restoration and recovery is blocked, whereas forgiveness unlocks it. So let go of every wrong anyone has done against you to enjoy the power of God for total restoration. PRAYER Father, in the name of Jesus, I thank You for healing my heart of bitterness, resentment, and unforgiveness by Your Word. By the help of the Holy Spirit, I am empowered to forgive totally and thoroughly, thereby basking in the power for total restoration and recovery in Jesus name. Amen! KEEP IN MIND Anywhere there is unforgiveness, God‚Äôs power for restoration and recovery is blocked, whereas forgiveness unlocks it.",,339,"{'like_count': 210, 'comment_count': 50, 'num_users': 305796}",Pst.

facebook,"SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY, BARRISTER CALEB MANASSEH MUTFWANG, EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR, PLATEAU STATE, DELIVERED AT THE UNITED STATE‚ÄôS INSTITUTE OF PEACE (USIP), WASHINGTON D.C.

FOCUS: Reflections on Plateau State‚Äôs Current State of Play & Forward-Looking Perspectives

Date: 16th October 2023
Venue: United States Institute of Peace (USIP) office, Washington D.C.

Distinguished invited guests and participants physically here seated and those joining us virtually, online.

I bring you warm greetings from the good and peace-loving people of my dear state, Plateau, ‚ÄúThe home of Peace and Tourism‚Äù, which is one of 36 the Federating States in Nigeria üá≥üá¨. I am deeply honoured to deliver a few thoughts on the topic : ‚Äúreflection on Plateau State‚Äôs current state of play & forward-looking perspectives‚Äù while assessing the impact of Nigeria‚Äôs democratic transition on state and local stakeholders.
2. I want to express sincere appreciation to the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) for giving me this opportunity to deliver this reflection on Plateau state, Nigeria, a state I am privileged to lead as Governor.
3. The relationship between Plateau State and the United States Institute of Peace dates to 2014 USIP support for the Yelwa Shendam peace Process that addressed the challenges faced by locals in the community.
Plateau is perhaps the first state to receive USIP support for her Peace Building Agency, which provided funds for from take off till it mature enough to undertake its core mandate of undertaking peace initiatives.
Let me also state that Plateau is also a beneficiary of the Network of Nigerian Facilitators (NNF) Programme implemented by USIP. The support provided to the NNF to work in Mangu local government on peace mediation is also being replicated in the Ganawuri- Manchok areas in Plateau State. USIP‚Äôs model in supporting local partners is key towards sustainability of impactful initiatives.
4. Plateau State is the twelfth-largest Nigerian state. It‚Äôs located near the capital of Nigeria and includes a range of hills surrounding the Jos Plateau, its capital, and the entire plateau itself. Plateau State is described as ""The Home of Peace and Tourism"" due to its natural formations of rocks, hills and waterfalls. It derives its name from the Jos Plateau. Plateau State is strategically located in the North Central part of Nigeria. The state is greatly endowed economically, by virtue of its rich agriculture, solid minerals, power potentials and tourism with vast land.

Although situated in the tropical zone, the higher altitude gives the state a near-temperate climate, with an average temperature between 13 and 22 ¬∞C.
Known for its heterogeneity, the state has about 54 autochthonous ethnic groups, among which are the Tarok, Ankwei, Angas, Jarawa, Berom, Mwaghavul, among others. The mining industry attracted Europeans and other foreign nationals, while trade and other geographical advantages drew Igbo (Ibo), Hausa and Yoruba immigrants into the state.

5. It is pertinent to state that Plateau State is a reflection of the diversity of Nigeria with different ethnic groups, different faiths, but who have all historically lived peacefully with each other. These people naturally don‚Äôt fight each other. 

Although the media is filled with n erroneous narrative of farmers-Herders / Indigenes- Settler‚Äôs clash, I make bold to say that there is no violent and disruptive conflict between herders and farmers in Plateau State. This narrative has been imposed by the media and persons who want to sound politically correct.

While it is true that there have been skirmishes between farmers and herders, they have traditionally coexisted symbiotically. These skirmishes are usually settled using traditional dispute mechanisms. Truth be told, what we have today are the violent activities of terrorists and bandits, carrying offensive military-type weapons, ravaging rural Plateau, killing and sacking the local populations, and taking over the land. Today, dozens of communities in Riyom, Barkin Ladi, Mangu, Bokkos LGAs have been sacked by the bandits and taken over by armed grazing marauders. These cannot be referred to as conflict between farmers and herders.

6. It will interest you to know that the Plateau conflict is not isolated. It is replicated in key states of the Middle Belt: Nasarawa, Benue, Taraba, the FCT, Niger, Kaduna, and the Northwestern states of Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara.

It is also worth noting that the suspected instigators and beneficiaries of these conflicts have often given the crises a religious colouration since the 1990s, however, religion has only been used as a convenient survival strategy for political advantage and economic dominance.

7. The 2001 crisis was the single largest violent conflict that happened within the city of Jos in which over 1000 persons were killed. This upset and reconfigured Jos the capital city. It is gratifying to note that with some measures taken in recent (truncated)",,336,"{'like_count': 253, 'comment_count': 37, 'num_users': 47270}",Caleb Mutfwang,,2023-10-17 17:55:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/347233176_248780114438528_4060385026220337897_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QsZt6hU3wZgAX833AKq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDyrybXLzsP_bEHGA9Zba9LCgUS1nhdd4VL5he-_U8H0w&oe=655AE9B8,https://www.facebook.com/100079196241175/posts/316607487655790,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392751060_296711793311886_2465108329384079761_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3kvD8XUla3UAX_Nf28j&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCFoyhYnj_XBn7EdspAJ1L0ndCXYG95ez6N2AzNI5pRZw&oe=653452C6

facebook,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Biden‚Äôs travel to Israel as the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip grows more dire and as Israel prepares for a possible ground attack on the 141-square-mile (365-square-kilometer) territory to root out Hamas militants responsible for what US and Israeli officials say was the most lethal assault against Jews since the Holocaust. But Biden‚Äôs presence could be seen as a provocative move by Hamas‚Äô chief sponsor, Iran, or potentially viewed as tone-deaf by Arab nations as civilian casualties mount in Gaza. Blinken has already been traveling around the Mideast this past week trying to prevent the war with Hamas from igniting a broader regional conflict. Blinken made the announcement early Tuesday after more than seven hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials. ‚ÄúHe is coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world,‚Äù Blinken said. Shortly after in Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced that Biden would also go to Jordan to meet with King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. White House officials said Biden‚Äôs talks with Arab leaders in Amman will largely focus on humanitarian concerns for Gaza‚Äôs 2.3 million people. He‚Äôll also make clear that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people‚Äôs right to dignity and self-determination. ‚ÄúWe are not putting conditions on the military assistance that we are providing to Israel,‚Äù Kirby said. ‚ÄúThey have a right to defend themselves. They have a right to go after this terrorist threat.‚Äù | via Associated Press",,331,"{'like_count': 172, 'comment_count': 27, 'num_users': 8782726}",Philippine Star,,2023-10-17 02:51:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/341858556_918415572727450_374717831366242673_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CecJtIgqe6QAX9kyAEL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDQlbN_xjai8pwVgUMXBU-S86hAA8foALC9kDrR1e8QGA&oe=655AF380,https://www.facebook.com/100064616655120/posts/721658383331377,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392925084_721656689998213_4883491996985923624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ExDkD-XJnKIAX8gCp8Q&_nc_oc=AQltTHWhyd5L5ZI5V0yLXws6xGVgmUaCnDqtP2ZyasMu24ZBuUq8ExCm3qf40z0mwXE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCr20MrIfOb7gRQ9Hbs6MIBaqOGEVvh-iqZbtd6omyEIA&oe=65333225

facebook,"SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY, BARRISTER CALEB MANASSEH MUTFWANG, EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR, PLATEAU STATE, DELIVERED AT THE UNITED STATE‚ÄôS INSTITUTE OF PEACE (USIP), WASHINGTON D.C. FOCUS: Reflections on Plateau State‚Äôs Current State of Play & Forward-Looking Perspectives Date: 16th October 2023 Venue: United States Institute of Peace (USIP) office, Washington D.C. Distinguished invited guests and participants physically here seated and those joining us virtually, online. I bring you warm greetings from the good and peace-loving people of my dear state, Plateau, ‚ÄúThe home of Peace and Tourism‚Äù, which is one of 36 the Federating States in Nigeria üá≥üá¨. I am deeply honoured to deliver a few thoughts on the topic : ‚Äúreflection on Plateau State‚Äôs current state of play & forward-looking perspectives‚Äù while assessing the impact of Nigeria‚Äôs democratic transition on state and local stakeholders. 2. I want to express sincere appreciation to the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) for giving me this opportunity to deliver this reflection on Plateau state, Nigeria, a state I am privileged to lead as Governor. 3. The relationship between Plateau State and the United States Institute of Peace dates to 2014 USIP support for the Yelwa Shendam peace Process that addressed the challenges faced by locals in the community. Plateau is perhaps the first state to receive USIP support for her Peace Building Agency, which provided funds for from take off till it mature enough to undertake its core mandate of undertaking peace initiatives. Let me also state that Plateau is also a beneficiary of the Network of Nigerian Facilitators (NNF) Programme implemented by USIP. The support provided to the NNF to work in Mangu local government on peace mediation is also being replicated in the Ganawuri- Manchok areas in Plateau State. USIP‚Äôs model in supporting local partners is key towards sustainability of impactful initiatives. 4. Plateau State is the twelfth-largest Nigerian state. It‚Äôs located near the capital of Nigeria and includes a range of hills surrounding the Jos Plateau, its capital, and the entire plateau itself. Plateau State is described as ""The Home of Peace and Tourism"" due to its natural formations of rocks, hills and waterfalls. It derives its name from the Jos Plateau. Plateau State is strategically located in the North Central part of Nigeria. The state is greatly endowed economically, by virtue of its rich agriculture, solid minerals, power potentials and tourism with vast land. Although situated in the tropical zone, the higher altitude gives the state a near-temperate climate, with an average temperature between 13 and 22 ¬∞C. Known for its heterogeneity, the state has about 54 autochthonous ethnic groups, among which are the Tarok, Ankwei, Angas, Jarawa, Berom, Mwaghavul, among others. The mining industry attracted Europeans and other foreign nationals, while trade and other geographical advantages drew Igbo (Ibo), Hausa and Yoruba immigrants into the state. 5. It is pertinent to state that Plateau State is a reflection of the diversity of Nigeria with different ethnic groups, different faiths, but who have all historically lived peacefully with each other. These people naturally don‚Äôt fight each other. Although the media is filled with n erroneous narrative of farmers-Herders / Indigenes- Settler‚Äôs clash, I make bold to say that there is no violent and disruptive conflict between herders and farmers in Plateau State. This narrative has been imposed by the media and persons who want to sound politically correct. While it is true that there have been skirmishes between farmers and herders, they have traditionally coexisted symbiotically. These skirmishes are usually settled using traditional dispute mechanisms. Truth be told, what we have today are the violent activities of terrorists and bandits, carrying offensive military-type weapons, ravaging rural Plateau, killing and sacking the local populations, and taking over the land. Today, dozens of communities in Riyom, Barkin Ladi, Mangu, Bokkos LGAs have been sacked by the bandits and taken over by armed grazing marauders. These cannot be referred to as conflict between farmers and herders. 6. It will interest you to know that the Plateau conflict is not isolated. It is replicated in key states of the Middle Belt: Nasarawa, Benue, Taraba, the FCT, Niger, Kaduna, and the Northwestern states of Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara. It is also worth noting that the suspected instigators and beneficiaries of these conflicts have often given the crises a religious colouration since the 1990s, however, religion has only been used as a convenient survival strategy for political advantage and economic dominance. 7. The 2001 crisis was the single largest violent conflict that happened within the city of Jos in which over 1000 persons were killed. This upset and reconfigured Jos the capital city. It is gratifying to note that with some measures taken in recent times, there (truncated)",,326,"{'like_count': 173, 'comment_count': 42, 'num_users': 21645}",The Time is Now,,2023-10-17 17:53:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/326143546_567095518342391_5988487503419924424_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eWj18Dll1L8AX-8ISCA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBRxsNwk2FBCtE2ROXqZPf-KI0rgTLZZfz6Jkt7nGatbQ&oe=655A60F6,https://www.facebook.com/100089192035375/posts/296711833311882,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392751060_296711793311886_2465108329384079761_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IUlozstdoE8AX_yR6oC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAp3cW3k9D_fE_VSPinpu7PKWcQJklrLMwfmsgJrcB2pw&oe=653E3606
facebook,"My heart has been heavy and my thoughts have been with the people of Palestine. A land rich in history, steeped in faith, and resilient in the face of adversity. A land that has endured the winds of conflict and the storms of occupation for far too long. This isn't about politics or religion, but about humanity. Regardless of where we come from or what we believe in, we must all stand for justice, for peace, and for the sanctity of human life. The people of Palestine are more than just headlines or statistics. They are mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, dreamers and doers, who deserve to live in dignity, freedom, and peace. They deserve a future where fear does not shadow their every step, where the night brings dreams, not dread, and where their rights as a human are respected and protected. It's time for us to use our voices to shine a light on the ongoing plight of Palestinians. To speak out against the injustices they face daily. To advocate for their right to self-determination. To pray for an end to their suffering. As we scroll through our feeds from the comfort of our homes, let's remember those who are living amidst the rubble, those whose lives hang in the balance, and those whose stories of courage and perseverance inspire us. May we never lose sight of our shared humanity. May we stand in solidarity with the oppressed, no matter where they are.

facebook,"PRESS RELEASE 103rd Infantry (Mabalasik) Battalion, 5th Infantry Division, Philippine Army ALLEGED MEMBER OF MILISYANG BAYAN CUT TIES with CPP-NPA-NDF Camalog, Pinukpuk, Kalinga - The concerted effort of MCCST operators under the 103rd Infantry ""Mabalasik"" Battalion led by Lt Col Lucas, Battalion Commander resulted in the return of alias ""Ben"" who is 43 years old and a resident of Brgy Poswoy, Balbalan, Kalinga, an alleged Milisyang Bayan under KLG BAGGAS, ICRC to the fold of the law. Alias ""Ben"" revealed that CTG operating in the area frequently visited him and entrusted him with an FA which he dug and hid in fear of being caught by the government forces. Upon revelation, troops along with alias ""Ben"" proceeded to the vicinity where he had hidden the FA which resulted in the recovery of One (1) M1 Carbine Assault Rifle, One (1) magazine for an M1 Carbine (20 rounder), and Nine (9) rounds of live ammunition for a carbine assault rifle. Lt Col Lucas said, ""The continuous revelations of kabagyan and kailyan in Kalinga only show support to the troops in ending armed conflict, we also encourage the other kabagyan and kailayan to carry out similar things to end the inhumane and abusive acts of CPP-NPA-NDF in the province of Kalinga.

This year, Delegates of the Historical Crisis Council (HCC) will be presented with the opportunity to reexamine and relive one of the most infamous wars on North American soil in the 19th century ‚Äì the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Topic: Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Both Mexico and the United States had their own set of issues by the time the conflict broke out. The former had been suffering from constant instability during its first three decades and a half of independence from the Spanish Empire. The latter, while an ever-expanding force of power, saw internal divisions from race and inequality grow greater and greater. Tensions over the independence of California and the incorporation of Texas into the US directly exacerbated disputes and led to the American invasion of its southern neighbors in 1846. The subsequent two-year conflict was one of the major precursors to the most divisive conflict in American history - the Civil War. At HMUN Mock #18, Delegates will play the role of prominent political and military figures on either side of the conflict, with the aim of not only achieving victory in battles but also securing territory and stability for their nation. Delegates will have to work closely with one another, noting their differences, to construct strategic successes and internal harmony. Which nation shall emerge victorious from these battles? Will there be long-lasting peace, or will division be here to stay? Delegates, this rests upon you! ___________________ M·ªçi th√¥ng tin xin li√™n h·ªá/ For all inquiries, please contact: Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Nhi√™n: +8496 432 8282 (ƒê·ªìng Tr∆∞·ªüng ban T·ªï ch·ª©c - T·ªïng Th∆∞ k√Ω/ Co-President - Secretaries-General) Qu√°ch Di·ªáu Linh: +8496 593 4148 (ƒê·ªìng Tr∆∞·ªüng ban T·ªï ch·ª©c - T·ªïng Th∆∞ k√Ω/ Co-President - Secretaries-General) Luy·ªán Ph∆∞∆°ng Linh: +8492 850 3786 (ƒê·ªìng Tr∆∞·ªüng ban Truy·ªÅn th√¥ng/ Co-Head of Public Relations) Mai T√∫ Uy√™n: +8490 223 3993 (ƒê·ªìng Tr∆∞·ªüng ban Truy·ªÅn th√¥ng/ Co-Head of Public Relations) Email: contact@hanoimun.org Website: hanoimun.org Instagram: @hanoimodelunorg",,314,"{'like_count': 44, 'comment_count': 113, 'num_users': 29331}",Hanoi Model United Nations Organization - HMUN Org.,,2023-10-17 14:03:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/387815419_644056734515905_4077275975120239341_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nNyU27siXnkAX-DxWRN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCG-TE2bxBt_XwGkbwjcz0Uv7fB8qUvcehBFly82Lo7rw&oe=6559C3FB,https://www.facebook.com/100067347526717/posts/648331064088472,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393251987_648330774088501_8907656664298799878_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nDsOsm-x1YsAX_rQ7y5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCk8YvUj2cpFfMImgh1xYXchB6lCbuDguzxibQ4ofHpoQ&oe=6534CA1D
facebook,"Good afternoon folks. I've been given the latitude to make a post here today as to the basic structure of the Justice for K9 Officer Chase page that we'd like not to vary from. Recently it's been brought to my attention that there's been a lot of internal friction between folks and derogatory comments made about other folks that belong to the group, and there's been some deliberately confrontational statements made amongst some of the members. I want to bring a few things to light if I may. One of them is we have a new group coming on board with us that has shown support and compassion for our efforts to bring Chase home. I certainly don't want these folks to be reading posts that have to do with a lot of internal conflict because I think quite frankly that will just make them go a different direction rather than supporting us and we don't want that to happen. I've also noticed and have been taking notice over the past month or so that there has just been a lot of speculation on people's part as to what happened and there's been a lot of specific statements made that cannot be validated or proven. I'm also seeing a lot of verbal bashing of particular individuals without us even really knowing all the pertinent information that needs to be had before making any statements of such. I personally think that statements like""Chase is dead and he's never coming back""and other statements like""he was thrown into the river or he died in a hot car""which nobody can prove need to come to an end. If you make a statement that is deliberately non-factual your post will be removed and you will be cautioned. If you make a statement such as""if Chase is at the rainbow bridge God bless him""certainly is compassionate and not viewed as derogatory. We need to get back to the initial focus of this page and that is to provide positive information and support to the members on this page that try to bring compassion and hope to the page for other folks who have the same feelings. The bashing and the name calling and the confrontational statements and the deliberately hurtful statements and information that is not factual will not be tolerated. You are free to speculate in your own mind as to what you think has happened or has not happened. We would like to keep this page up and running, and I can't imagine how many people have just walked away seeing the internal strife along with arguments and the friction between people with their posts and insinuations. Could we please revert back to the initial focus and plan that we had put in place months ago when this page was started and that is just one focus, and one focus only. That is to bring Chase home. I get a lot of private messages from people telling me they don't like what they see or what they have read that is negative and confrontational in content. That absolutely needs to stop today without exception without argument. I've never been one to be extremely eloquent with my conversation and have been pretty much right to the point with what I've had to say, however at this point I thought using the discretion to be as diplomatic as possible would be in order. Please, please do not make us ban people from the page because they're focus is totally different and accusatory which leads to arguments and conflicts. Please do not do that anymore. This page has always been about Chase and bringing Chase home and quite frankly there's not one of us that can do anything about the situation with Mr. Dudley and or his sentencing or his punishment. You never know who's trolling this page and we certainly don't want to look like a bunch of unprofessional, accusatory vigilantes so to speak. Let's get back to being professional and bringing compassion and positive thoughts to the page. Thank you for your time and consideration. One last thing, because this is my post this is my choice for picture.",,313,"{'like_count': 96, 'comment_count': 59, 'num_users': 5754}",Justice For K-9 Officer Chase,,2023-10-17 18:17:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/353672787_10224128837592240_8522535776201046631_n.jpg?stp=c5.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IMwyItu9qccAX8o3t5H&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCLHunLHkomyBeaDW90gEw_DR0Y-WWGl22hwop05ogl4Q&oe=655A330F,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1290617918219086/permalink/1356194244994786,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393446048_7632557253427744_1581757222728998871_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=OENJbtdAhUYAX99bNNE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC6P4_3KW9hKBilyrWtgvdFHK36UgN9O0WIKR1pmEkqGg&oe=654EBD7F

Let's hope that this conflict brings new awareness of unity among those who do not seek differences in the past but equality in the future. Matias D.

facebook,"```DAILY ‚ìÇÔ∏èANNA OCTOBER 17, 2023 *NO BOUNDARIES* üìúüìúAMOS 2:1-5üìúüìú üîëüìñKEY VERSE: _*‚ÄúThus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked‚Äù*_ (Amos 2:4). *MESSAGE* All men are equal before God. As the ultimate Judge of all creations, God does not consider background, colour, race or social status as a condition for determining the end of all men. As shown in Proverbs 3:1, God requires all men irrespective of where they come from not to forget His law. This forms the fulcrum of today‚Äôs text. God spoke to Prophet Amos about His resolve to judge Moab and Judah based on their transgressions. As for Moab, God promised not to ‚Äúturn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime‚Äù. In the case of Judah, God frowned at their flagrant disregard of His words. As a result, He insisted on bringing punishment upon them ‚Äúbecause they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments‚Ä¶‚Äù Moab was a Gentile nation, which was constantly in conflict with the Israelites. Amos proclaimed Moab‚Äôs doom for seizing and burning the king of Edom. In its case, Judah was out of the 12 tribes that constituted Israel. Judah, like Moab, transgressed the word of the Lord. Even though Judah was a tribe of Israel, God did not spare them. Rather, He promised to send fire upon Judah and devour the palaces of Jerusalem for despising His laws. This account reveals that God is neither of the Jews nor of the Gentiles exclusively. He is the God of all creation. He never discriminates based on background, colour, ethnicity, political class or social status. He is the ultimate Judge, who determines the actions and deeds of all men purely based on equity, fairness and justice. He demands outright compliance with His word as a condition for walking with Him and ultimately escaping eternal damnation. ‚úçüèªTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY: God‚Äôs judgment does not respect a sinner‚Äôs status. üìúüìúBIBLE IN ONE YEARüìúüìú *ISAIAH 46 ‚Äì 50",,311,"{'like_count': 285, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 40141}",Encounter Yeshua,,2023-10-17 07:49:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/354978664_227080156839854_8089297791116738958_n.jpg?stp=c0.15.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8C7VMDaMJWIAX_iOul3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAHMubbP1gspDN7HlPm6nwb6bT7EFvcIgSTNNnKSlqfmQ&oe=655A3F90,https://www.facebook.com/100086136140610/posts/295832376631298,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393383547_295832346631301_7195370144038287420_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cLI-plnN-OcAX-4NGpQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB691vIALoE875xAbhR_NCXxu2fiv2-dNCm5izspybxlQ&oe=654BF374

facebook,"As expected earlier today, the South Carolina Court of Appeals agreed to stay and hold in abeyance Alex Murdaugh‚Äôs appeal from his double murder conviction of March 2023, and remanded the issue of whether he is entitled to a new trial based on juror interference issues to the trial court in front of Judge Newman. This was totally expected. The issues raised by Team Murdaugh are serious and significant IF TRUE and that is a big IF, that a determination needs to be made regarding their validity. Juror interference is unacceptable and goes to the heart of our jury trial system. Judge Newman will make a determination on how this matter will proceed. The defense will argue that they are entitled to full discovery rights to depose, and or subpoena the testimony from jurors and other witnesses. Whether that is going to be granted will have to be seen. We are interested in seeing how the Attorney General will weigh in on this decision and give their take on what the procedure should look like going forward. Based on Harpootlian's several in-and-out-of-court statements about Judge Newman, it would not surprise us if the defense makes a motion for another judge to entertain their motion for a new trial, arguing that Judge Newman is in conflict. This is about to get really interesting, where the rubber meets the road. We are quite certain that the Attorney General‚Äôs office is prepared and loaded forbear to refute Team Murdaugh‚Äôs contentions.",,309,"{'like_count': 217, 'comment_count': 43, 'num_users': 14480}",Eric Bland,,2023-10-17 19:30:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/317833796_127306356837513_710828468298871166_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LaEyIANEk2kAX-rvzwS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD_ZrMiM9XnUE8RCOsFnIXZ0hJ7UNrHxARXmxqpYSlbLg&oe=655A4C29,https://www.facebook.com/100086744483746/posts/297936526441161,

Anwar said that it is crucial and paramount to prioritise the well-being and safety of all individuals affected by this crisis. #malaysia #news #israel #gaza #palestine #anwaribrahim #peace #politics #war #trendingnow",,307,"{'like_count': 73, 'comment_count': 185, 'num_users': 434171}",Malay Mail,,2023-10-17 04:02:50,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/280133581_370781861752841_8660060869483118711_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=1PtDQQFxNbcAX-Vp45S&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBexYvJ4tzUvlkE7C0vXPRc_4RSKPkHjHSzoawikK8j_Q&oe=6559D573,https://www.facebook.com/100064630908028/posts/723952553102435,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391713682_18391109428046115_994965077545718562_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rVzKNgufUgsAX9AXFSE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCvp9h6jJU71St9xqe-9Az-C3CbbPxWJ7AvWLvh8e72rg&oe=6533494E

Besides the two, acclaimed filmmaker, Borun Thokcom, also from the state, was a proud spectator at the glittering awards ceremony as he was among a few film personalities of the nation who were jury members of non-feature film category. President Draupadi Murmu conferred the awards to the outstanding filmmakers and cast and crews at the ceremony attended by a constellation of great Indian movie stars and promoters. This year, the ‚ÄúDada Saheb Phalke Award‚Äù (lifetime achievement award), the highest film honour of the country, went to yester year‚Äôs shinning bollywood beauty, Waheda Raham. President Murmu, praised Waham and said she represents a women of substance and a shining symbol of an empowered woman. Romi received the award for his iconic feature film ‚ÄúEikhoigi Yum‚Äù (Our house), while Ratan went home with the award for his flick ‚ÄúBeyond Blast‚Äù. Romi was honoured with the best Manipuri feature film category, while Ratan bagged the best biographical non feature film award. Before making a debut with parallel cinema with ‚ÄúEikhoigi Yum‚Äù, Romi was an successful mainstream commercial filmmaker as he made over 100 such movies most of which were box office hits. Minutes after bagging his first ever National film award Romi DIPR that Tuesday‚Äôs event was great and memorial, but the current crisis gripping the state has dampened his celebratory moods. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy with the recognition given to ‚ÄúEikhoigi Yum‚Äù which is my first non-commercial project. As much as I wished, I‚Äôm unable to enjoy the moment considering the conflict going on in Manipur,‚Äù Romi quipped. ‚ÄúI must thank Manipur State Film Development Society (MFSDS) for the inspiration it has provided me with the yearlong events it organized to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Manipuri Cinema (1972-2022). In fact, ‚ÄúEikhoigi Yum‚Äù had the privilege of opening one of the highlights of the celebration, the first ‚ÄòEikhoigi Imphal International Film Festival‚Äô (EIIFF),‚Äù he said. Ratan said Tuesday‚Äôs awards ceremony ‚Äúis the pinnacle of my filmmaking journey which started in 1992. I‚Äôm overwhelmed by this honour. But sadly, the situation back home prevents me to indulge.‚Äù Jury member Borun who is himself a national awardee filmmaker officiated as jury member for the national honours for the first time said ‚Äúwe had to view more than 200 short and documentary films in multi-languages. However, at the end of the day, beauty has no language barriers and language of cinema presided, and films made with passion and with the right intent stood out as always. I feel happy that Manipuri filmmakers did well in both the categories, feature and non-feature.",,267,"{'like_count': 200, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 20394}",·¥õ ú·¥á ·¥ç·¥á…™·¥õ·¥á…™Íú± ·¥Ñ ú Ä·¥è…¥…™·¥Ñ ü·¥áÍú±,,2023-10-17 15:40:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/397958663_311117655038902_7030822188346462096_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7OWfRsD5OgwAX-bbQs2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBDcgr35-jKEv8OAR4VVpG1Um1Enl-5s0Yl204-OqKyHQ&oe=655B0590,https://www.facebook.com/100084220103098/posts/301900192627315,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393606502_301900125960655_1547131658330626716_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=err8nVQYkC4AX8z3XIy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDUBgtUI3-Igjq9tJovr8GJAKTgY2pDDPefQlVWrZZRVg&oe=65343514

facebook,"During the American Civil War, Virginia resident William Terrill Bradby was one of an estimated 20,000 Native Americans who served with Union military forces in the fight against the Confederacy. A large part of Bradby‚Äôs own contributions to the Union cause involved maritime transportation. A member of the Pamunkey Tribe, Bradby was born in Virginia in 1833. After the Civil War broke out in 1861, Bradby remained loyal to the Union even though Virginia joined the Confederacy. Bradby‚Äôs unwavering decision to side with the North resulted in his church expelling him from its congregation. Even more significantly, his military service on behalf of the Union often placed him at high risk and in harm‚Äôs way. Bradby‚Äôs initial activities with the Union forces included serving as a land guide and scout for the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign in southeastern Virginia in 1862. The following year, however, Bradby exchanged those land-based assignments for ‚Äúwater duty‚Äù when he joined the Union Navy. Throughout the remainder of the war, Bradby served on a variety of military ships and boats and even piloted several of those vessels. For a good part of 1863-64, for example, he was a pilot second class for vessels that were part of a Union flotilla on the James River in Virginia. While serving on the steamship USS Shokokon on that river, Bradby was shot in the leg by a Confederate shell. This injury turned out to be only a flesh wound, but it brought about rheumatism that would plague Bradby for the remainder of his days. Other vessels on which Bradby served were the gunboats USS Onondaga and USS Huron; the tugboat USS Epsilon; the steamship USS Daylight; and the torpedo boat USS Spuyten Duyvil. There were several other Native Americans from Virginia who likewise served the Union as guides and pilots during the war. They included Bradby‚Äôs brother Sterling as well as Thornton Allmond, John Langston, William Sampson, and Powhatan Weisiger. William Terrill Bradby‚Äôs own military record, however, is one of the most detailed and best documented of that group. After the Civil War ended, Bradby returned to where he had lived prior to the conflict: the Pamunkey reservation on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia. Bradby remained there for the rest of his life, becoming one the most respected members of the community. He died sometime around 1905.",,266,"{'like_count': 208, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 43228}",Nativeamerican.1492,,2023-10-17 19:00:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/333814156_742849570809752_1367253775066570749_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=f8lAj6hoKKoAX-QiqHU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCx3eSOQbkN_ZDVMI7WEUQwP74mCeHVm-0iFiyPNnyxtg&oe=6559AEC7,https://www.facebook.com/100089357900736/posts/294516293536965,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393407337_294098520245409_4741720257117964454_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Rli4SYH34A4AX-7acZd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAWhHodYRKeRcP8Kg6eIRKrnRtGinMnPpuey2zsz6VvYg&oe=6534C03D

facebook,"Official Statement on the Vote for Speaker of the House This week, when members of the House of Representatives reconvene to vote for a speaker, they will have the opportunity to demonstrate their enduring commitment to our Constitutional system of government. While a handful of extremists have precipitated a crisis of leadership, an equally small number of courageous and reasonable actors have the opportunity to exhibit bipartisanship and restore faith in ethical governance. As leaders and members of Mormon Women for Ethical Government, we ask all members of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, to find a pathway to the election of a speaker who has proven they will support the peaceful transfer of power. We are once again faced with a conflict within our governing bodies that would have previously seemed unthinkable. As citizens, we are asked to accept an impossible compromise ‚Äî tolerate congressional leaders who have worked to undermine a legitimate election, or risk having no functioning government at all. It is important for our elected representatives to see this compromise for what it is ‚Äî an extortionate lie. Installing a speaker who previously voted against the certification of the 2020 election will compromise the security and stability of our nation. Those who worked to undermine the last election should not be trusted to oversee the next one. In the election for House leadership, it falls to members of the majority party to control their extreme factions. Key Republican members of the House must stand fast and work to elect a speaker who has demonstrated respect both for their colleagues and for legislative norms and processes. In addition, we earnestly plead with members of the Democratic caucus to work across the aisle with Republicans who are committed to upholding the rule of law. Any Democrat who votes to elect competent and ethical House leadership could reasonably claim to be a principled defender of good government, national security, fiscal responsibility, and respect for the individual citizens of this nation. These things must matter more than party politics. We are in a moment when it feels as though much of the world is in chaos. Sadly, the chaos we are experiencing at home is being recklessly self-inflicted. It is time for our leaders to make choices that will benefit the nation, and the members of the U.S. House of Representatives can begin this week by choosing to vote in defense of Constitutional government. We ask that they prioritize preservation of the rule of law, protection of national norms, and an absolute and unshakable commitment to the peaceful transfer of power above all other political objectives. The people of our nation deserve no less from their leaders. #officialstatement",,246,"{'like_count': 106, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 17752}",Mormon Women for Ethical Government,,2023-10-17 12:20:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271626191_1407280186354303_8693228059132332077_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YgywFFR280MAX-EMsdY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAHUIFobGwklrVEKXqHU35rLpwKMMC0hDn_dP8qShhgrA&oe=655ADD10,https://www.facebook.com/100064906531799/posts/710516724455206,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392939989_710515221122023_6513355547592359406_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cvFD8whXtbwAX8RzB2Y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCqDCWjvNzRzyORXYiUwwwSPw1nYyLVVLSsroBcdu0JaA&oe=653C14C3

Die VF Plus het geweier om aan die gebaar deel te neem en is van mening dat dieselfde eer ook teenoor die inwoners van Israel betoon moet word.

The FF Plus refused to participate in the gesture, and is of the opinion that the same homage ought to be paid to the people of Israel as well. The FF Plus stands in solidarity with the people of Israel in their fight against the terrorist group Hamas, and will not be forced to unilaterally choose sides in council chambers.

facebook,"**Caudron has gone to court.** Fr√©d√©ric Caudron, the undisputed number one player on the PBA tour, has taken his conflict with the organizing body to court. He was sidelined earlier this year when he and the PBA could not agree about the terms of a new contract. The Belgian has now placed his case before Seoul District magistrates, and a decision is expected later this month. Neither party is still opening up about financial details in the negotiation. What did come out, were arguments made by both parties. Caudron is accused by the PBA of making ‚Äúexcessive demands‚Äù, one of those being his unwillingness to participate in mixed doubles during the team events. His subsequent unavailability for the team competition resulted in the PBA scrapping his participation in the individual events, where, needless to say, the most prize money is. In turn, Caudron accuses the PBA of ‚Äúabusing their position of power‚Äù to force obligations on him. He disputes the PBA‚Äôs right to exclude him from individual events because of his absence in the team competition, and says he has never been presented with any regulations relevant to that exclusion. Disclaimer: these facts were found in Korean, then auto-translated to English. As we all know, auto-translations are still far from perfect. I have tried to present the case with the utmost impartiality (BvM).",,235,"{'like_count': 156, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 4493}",Bert's billiard page,,2023-10-17 20:13:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/402281361_7297515056925403_3253983377181210336_n.jpg?stp=c22.0.50.50a_cp1_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hgMfeHlUFoMAX-VFg8c&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB8XABCbHEIwNpQafmyjcQ3VAB6M943c1mtib1S5A_Fdg&oe=655B3A3E,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1453484611586548/permalink/3518991198369202,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393747227_7195399370470306_5711912683363746942_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=oGwnyuPMS1wAX8zFo8U&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAuziua9LqmW4_4eyPk7nvaNVqaY86vqnoz7CjgOGwh7g&oe=6558FBE8

The answer to this is now available on my YouTube channel (link in the comments) In this video I aim to provide you, not only with an answer to that very important question, but also the reasons why it is such a powerful training methodology. I discuss the reasons finding a mentor is crucially important in the development of a trainer and how to identify the right mentor for you. I dive deep into my history as a trainer and what makes me different from every single teacher and trainer in the industry. The aspects that separate and allow Training Without Conflict¬Æ to rise above all other training methods is also explored in depth.

facebook,"Hello my fellow Llanites, I had someone come up to me this past week and try and explain that the correct term for citizens of Llano should be Llanoans. I explained why I refer to the people of the City of Llano as Llanites rather than Llanoans or Llanoians. Llanite is a special form of granite unique in all the world. It is a tough and beautiful rock with properties that set it apart from other forms of granite. It is one-of-a-kind. Llanoians sounds like a type of floor covering. Something to be walked on, unnoticed and common. I like to use the term that more accurately describes the people of our community, special, beautiful, and unique. You may or may not have been aware that this past Saturday was Llano Day at the State Fair of Texas. It was also, unfortunately a day that a shooting took place and three people were injured. For Llano, it represented another case of where an outside source came into our party and injected an element of fear and division. I cannot and will not get into details of what I am specifically referring to at this point in time, however, let me say that outside elements have been driving division and misconception in our community. Read into that whatever you want, but my point is that prior to such outside input, we were a much more cohesive community. I would like to get back to that. I can hear it now, ‚ÄúWhy don't you just say what you mean!‚Äù Believe me, I would love to do exactly that, but the constraints of position and office preclude me from doing so. Suffice it to say that regardless of what wedge of division that is being driven into Llano, we as a community can choose to get along, or not. I would hope that the ties that bind us together are strong enough to endure and outlast such pressures from outside sources. Remember you have more in common with your next-door neighbor than you do with someone from Austin or Washington or anyplace else. Given the current world situation, that is more important than ever. I am writing this early Sunday morning and by the time you read it, the world could have changed radically. I will give you an example. The situation in the middle east is beginning to boil rapidly and you may think that we are well removed from the direct effects of that conflict. That is not the case. I will remind you of our proximity to the border. A number of years ago, Hamas made a coalition with the cartels in Mexico. The cartels have money for weapons, and Hamas has plenty of military weapons and needs money. The cartels also have a well-developed network for smuggling people or products. It was a natural business development. While the latest reports that I have seen show that there is no immediate threat known to the State of Texas, situational awareness is of the utmost importance. I also know of a good number of organizations and institutions that are stepping up their game in being prepared and aware. Larger churches are tightening up their security teams, schools are checking their security measures and briefings are going on in law enforcement agencies. In other words, this is no joke. The US has deployed troops to Northern Gaza, we have a second aircraft carrier headed to the Mediterranean and the world seems to be choosing up sides. We as a community need to get beyond what differences we have and come back together. I am certainly not trying to scare anyone, but I am stating some facts. The world we live in today is very different to the one we inhabited pre-Covid. We as a community need to rise to the occasion rather than sink into the circumstances. The world has become a much more dangerous place, even in just the last couple of weeks. Time to put aside differences and pull together in the harness of our community. I don't want to be preachy or come off sounding sanctimonious, but this is very important and we need to start today. I love Llano, it is without a doubt the best place I have ever lived. Let's not allow outside forces to drive us apart or change us into something we are not. For those who don't know, when you take a piece of Llanite and expose it to the light, there is a beauty and blue sparkle that is almost like a gemstone. I want to you see yourselves as Llanites, special people who are unique, tough but caring, resourceful, and resolute, with a beauty and sparkle that is like that of the Llanite stone. Regardless of what the world throws at us we can excel. In the words of Hank Jr. ‚Äúcountry folks can survive.‚Äù",,224,"{'like_count': 57, 'comment_count': 121, 'num_users': 6858}","City of Llano, Texas - City Hall",,2023-10-17 21:03:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242539175_222178129938970_6225794692977112435_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Bu_KSWGXgfgAX98g9et&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAO3wts8K-IyjOgDQiyQiPdepqR140Bb8p3KvvvMOua1g&oe=655B1DF6,https://www.facebook.com/100064403545300/posts/713500817473363,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391597857_713500750806703_4298456953608102666_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=40uP4kfwIZMAX8bPDxM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAhPvdk2y3BjvmUr226nLQ_1fpz08tLXodaYqvfQrwn4Q&oe=6557FD01

Dakota County is four times larger than Gaza and home to 755 people per square mile. The Gaza Strip is nearly 20 times as dense, with a whopping 14,628 residents per square mile. Similarly, Minnesota has 10 times the land as Israel, yet Israel possesses twice the population. This means there are 60 people per square mile living in Minnesota, compared with over 1,000 people per square mile in Israel.

The award-winning Green & Blue explores the painful and humorous realities faced by the individuals who patrolled the border during the height of the conflict. An officer from the Royal Ulster Constabulary in his green uniform and Eddie from An Garda S√≠och√°na, resplendent in blue, communicate via crackly radios until an explosive incident forces them to meet across a field only farmers know the location of. Focusing on what it‚Äôs like to be hunted when you‚Äôre protecting a man-made line on the ground, the play looks at the societal and human cost of borders. ‚ÄòGreen & Blue‚Äô is based on real-life interviews with former serving officers.

We decree God's peace and blessing rests upon Israel and Jerusalem. We declare peace to her borders and that all enemy fire shall cease. We ask for angelic reinforcements to bring protection to the walls of Israel and that its places of government shall remain safe. We break the power of all dread, fear, and terror among the people. We say they shall not fear attacks, bombings, missiles, and foreign invasion. We prophesy that their homes, streets, businesses, and historical sites shall be protected. We declare that Israel's land shall remain secure, and no politicians or governments of the earth shall be able to enact agreements or accords that take their land away. We say that Jerusalem belongs to God. We speak strength to the state of Israel. We prophesy that a prosperity from the Lord rests upon it and the Jewish people. Israel belongs to God and Israel is forever. We declare that the Gospel of Jesus Christ shall shine in Israel and many shall come to the way of salvation. May the United States of America never break its alliance with Israel. We bind every effort by the government to detach from Israel, and we declare that America shall always defend Israel and seek its good. We pray for the defeat and destruction of Islamist terrorist invaders. We pray for the physical rescue of Israelis under siege, those who are kidnapped, those who are wounded. We pray for divine wisdom and decisive strategy to be given to Israel's leaders in every area. We pray that God will break the arrows and bow of the enemy, and for supernatural protection for Israel against all rockets and missile attacks from God and his angels. We pray that Israel‚Äôs enemies will be confused and will turn and flee. We pray for salvation and revival to break out in Israel. We pray that they would come to know Jesus as their true Messiah. We pray that their eyes would be opened to see the love and light of Jesus in the middle of their darkest hour. God we declare that this conflict will not escalate into World War 3. We declare that it will end quickly and every attempt of the enemy to turn it into something more is cancelled in Jesus‚Äô name. We pray for peace in Israel and worldwide.

facebook,"How to strengthen your loving relationship...‚úç Everyone‚Äôs relationship is unique, and people come together for many different reasons. But there are some things that good relationships have in common. Knowing the basic principles of healthy relationships helps keep them meaningful, fulfilling and exciting in both happy times and sad: So what makes a healthy love relationship? 1. Staying involved with each other... Some relationships get stuck in peaceful coexistence, but without truly relating to each other and working together. While it may seem stable on the surface, lack of involvement and communication increases distance. When you need to talk about something important, the connection and understanding may no longer be there. 2. Getting through conflict... Some couples talk things out quietly, while others may raise their voices and passionately disagree. The key in a strong relationship, though, is not to be fearful of conflict. You need to be safe to express things that bother you without fear of retaliation, and be able to resolve conflict without humiliation, degradation or insisting on being right. 3. Keeping outside relationships and interests alive... No one person can meet all of our needs, and expecting too much from someone can put a lot of unhealthy pressure on a relationship. Having friends and outside interests not only strengthens your social network, but brings new insights and stimulation to the relationship, too. 4. Communicating... Honest, direct communication is a key part of any relationship. When both people feel comfortable expressing their needs, fears, and desires, trust and bonds are strengthened. Nonverbal cues‚Äîbody language like eye contact, leaning forward or away, or touching someone‚Äôs arm‚Äîare critical to communication.",,200,"{'like_count': 149, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 194935}",Onyinye obilor,,2023-10-17 10:43:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/379130974_649682403935060_3654720421016917344_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=kBU53luotx8AX_7Ujoz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBaYOmXeUvUBFMG0VLx6Nq407Kv-aYy33wqnW16GO9Ysg&oe=655B36EA,https://www.facebook.com/100066799194370/posts/666869275549706,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393407510_666869252216375_8080473990580867243_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=dYXsh2hUFicAX9fS33L&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDGAHbzSn6j0d6TYGr53D8h18FPB97T5EQj6zaM5qloIA&oe=65332484

Here‚Äôs a short acrostic using the word REAL that you can use as a checklist to make sure your conflicts are actually being resolved: R - Do you completely RECEIVE your spouse despite the conflict? Receiving each other is the foundation of REAL resolution. Although unresolved conflict causes at least some division, receiving your spouse before, during, and after the conflict minimizes the gap. Receiving your spouse despite a conflict tells them that they are more important than the resolution. E - Did both of you EXPRESS yourselves authentically? Conflict requires mutual understanding of each other‚Äôs perspective. Mutual understanding requires both of you to speak the truth in love about how you feel about the topic. If there‚Äôs something less than truth being spoken on one or both sides, the conflict is likely not resolved and will probably come up again. A - Did both of you ADMIT your fault? Talking through a conflict or issue will typically reveal areas that need to be confessed by both of you. REAL Resolution isn‚Äôt just being willing to confess, but searching for opportunities to confess to each other for how you contributed towards the issue‚Ä¶regardless of who is more at fault. L - Can you both express what you LEARNED about yourselves and each other in response to the conflict? When you experience REAL resolution, you should walk away knowing yourself and each other better so you can respond differently to similar situations moving forward. . . . #realresolution #conflict #conflictresolution #marriage #marriagerevolution #resolution #fightfair",,196,"{'like_count': 98, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 36502}",Marriage Revolution,,2023-10-17 20:40:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312483289_542904561179974_2669711524998037364_n.jpg?stp=c155.155.770.770a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4BfV8eHKpDMAX-F3hLk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBDtBIM8PLdUied7s6KodDUnF6l1sjEPCtMVlaDFbnnEw&oe=655B6237,https://www.facebook.com/100063813043316/posts/805282698275491,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393590896_805282674942160_281432514995922830_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=5jkuWQxDGJoAX91DVQK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC1g5tXq-fF6wISlkyY2BwWiLmxLqporrYtPZkYBpKwzg&oe=65597EA4
facebook,"Here are some of the photos taken during the Orthros and Divine Liturgy, which was celebrated at the Church of St. Porphyrios in Gaza on Sunday (15/10/23). As we prepare to go to sleep tonight, please pray to the Lord for those without shelter, food, water or suffering unimaginable grief. That through our united prayers, together with the intercessions of the Theotokos and all the saints, the Lord may protect the reported hundreds of Christians and Muslims who are sheltering at the Holy Monastery of Saint Porphyrios in the Gaza Strip. In great tragedy we often see the greatest of courage. We must never forget that in all armed conflict it is often the innocent civilians and the most vulnerable who are impacted. We are witnessing a tragedy where Christians, Muslims and Jews are all suffering, with children experiencing horrors that is taking away all innocence. Let us keep our humanity and stay strong in prayer for all innocent victims. Prayer is so important right now. _____________________ Please see the following posts: > Quote by His Eminence Archbishop Tiberiados Alexios of Gaza stating that he will not leave his flock: https://rb.gy/i9ko4:=:https://www.facebook.com/orthodoxchristianity.religion/posts/if-i-die-i-will-have-a-dignified-deathas-long-as-there-is-at-least-one-christian/631278482539645/ > A call to prayer by His Beatitude Patriarch Theophillos III: https://rb.gy/279l8:=:https://www.facebook.com/orthodoxchristianity.religion/posts/there-is-yet-time-to-stop-the-hatred-%EF%B8%8F-day-of-prayer-fastingan-urgent-request-by/630144972652996/ [Credit images: Saint Porphyrios Orthodox Church - Gaza (https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064762893735)]",,195,"{'like_count': 74, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 44436}",Greek Orthodox Daily Posts for Inspiration,,2023-10-17 10:17:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/326471904_2316098795256741_4547930279919517524_n.jpg?stp=c2.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bdmAMzSSYmMAX9yOoHM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAvI1nc7q-HS5UevO-eBVunlUfuFD_x5gJlpjr7j_fQpA&oe=655B23EE,https://www.facebook.com/100064349006204/posts/718237896997837,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391653821_631505359183624_3202756772735382465_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=_Rk3nS51TqIAX_2Aitf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBk-AnBrcVu79dWWNpuAlr0ZWQQp06IqPt9DdRLnz4xrA&oe=65344E7A

facebook,"THE WORD OF THE LORD FOR THE NATION OF LIBERIA üá±üá∑ As it relates to the peace of our Land, Mama Liberia, there are factors responsible for the peace we want. The Church in times past was silent and a partaker of evil, so God chose to judge our nation. Because the Church failed, our nation failed! But not anymore! Liberia is a resurrected state. 2 Chronicles 7:14 says ‚ÄúIf my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.‚Äù Our nation is healed, therefore we will not sit down and watch crisis return. We must not be silent any longer. As peace-loving and patriotic citizens, we have the right to warn anyone that is beating the drums of war. 1 Tim. 2:2 urges us to pray for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. To our Excellency, President George M. Weah, the Speaker of the House, the Chief Justice, the leaders of the opposition parties, the elections commission, and all in every form of authority, God will hold you responsible for any form of war, conflict, or bloodshed! History will hold you responsible and our generation will hold you responsible! Stop speaking evil and allow the will of God to be done! Liberia is greater than any one of you. We decree and declare by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, there will be peace in Liberia. God will hold you responsible if one bullet of violence is fired in this land. The church of Jesus Christ will not remain silent. Any attempt to tamper with the will of God, you and your generations unborn will receive the full judgment of God. Peace has returned to Liberia, and our peace will not be taken away. We turn over the elections over to the courts of heaven and we decree that heaven shall rule and cast the final judgment. This nation will not be divided no longer. If you do what is right, peace will reign, but if you make the wrong decisions, you will answer the judgment of heaven and the judgment of the people. Let peace reign! Anyone planning evil against this land is hereby Judged by the Almighty in the name of Jesus. The thunder of heaven will strike you. The sun, moon and stars will smite you. If you stand up for evil, the earth will swallow you up. Let Justice be done! ‚ÄúViolence shall no longer be heard in your land, Neither wasting nor destruction within your borders; But you shall call your walls Salvation, And your gates Praise.‚Äù Isaiah 60:18 What must we all do? 1. We must stop tribal sentiments 2. We must allow peace, righteousness and Justice for all. 3. We must allow the rule of law 4. We must play by the rule and allow democracy. Let the will of the people speak. 5. We must be patient and accept any right results in line with the law. 6. We must align ourselves with God‚Äôs agenda and not personal agenda. God bless you.

facebook,"Helen Mitchell (getrouwd met Colin die op het Vrij Zijn Weekend in februari hoopt te spreken) beschrijft een indrukwekkende ervaring op haar blog. Colin en Helen hebben twee Palestijnse kinderen geadopteerd. Colin is nog steeds in Haifa Isra√´l: Toen ons vliegtuig zaterdagavond opsteeg - een gecharterde vlucht georganiseerd door de Britse regering om haar burgers te redden van de oorlog in Isra√´l - brak ik in tranen uit. Voor het eerst sinds het begin van de oorlog gunde ik mezelf de luxe om te huilen - diepe, zware snikken uit de bodem van mijn longen. Ik probeerde de tranen niet langer te bedwingen, zoals ik de hele week had gedaan, voor het geval ze de kinderen zouden waarschuwen voor de ernst van de situatie, of voor het geval de diepte van mijn verdriet me zou verhinderen helder te denken en snel te handelen. Terwijl we hoog boven de flikkerende lichten van wegen, auto's en huizen uitstegen, werd ik overmand door verdriet om het lijden van de mensen in dit prachtige land. Ik huilde om alle ouders, kinderen, ouderen en jongeren die een week eerder wakker waren geworden met de gedachte dat het een gewone Shabbat zou worden, om zich vervolgens binnen een fractie van een seconde in een van de wreedste bloedbaden te bevinden die de wereld ooit heeft gezien. Omdat ik zelf moeder ben, waren het de verhalen van de kinderen die me verscheurden, en hun ouders die stierven terwijl ze hen probeerden te beschermen, zonder succes. Terwijl ik in het vliegtuig zat, merkte ik dat ik steeds maar weer zei: ""Het spijt me, het spijt me"". Ik voelde me zo schuldig dat ik nu mijn mensen in Isra√´l achterliet. Dat ik in het vliegtuig zat op weg naar veiligheid, terwijl zovelen van hen nooit de kans hebben gekregen. Dat zoveel families in Isra√´l zich in een hel bevinden met geliefden die gegijzeld worden in Gaza, met zonen en dochters die vechten en sterven aan het front, met raketten en sirenes en chaos en terreur. ""Het spijt me zo, Isra√´l, dat ik jullie nu verlaat."" Terwijl ik huilde, vroeg mijn zevenjarige dochter die naast me zat niet waarom. Ze begon gewoon stilletjes haar eigen verzonnen liedje te zingen. ""Mama, het is goed, je kleine meisje is nu bij je. Je dochter houdt van je en je hoeft geen pijn te hebben."" Dit was het kleine meisje dat een paar uur eerder nog in paniek had gegild omdat ze zo bang was voor de oorlog, het kleine meisje dat ik niet goed had kunnen vasthouden of troosten omdat ik zo wanhopig was om ons op de vlucht te krijgen. Later, toen we in Engeland aankwamen en ik ontdooid was, bedankte ik mijn dochter voor haar vliegtuigliedje. Ik sloeg mijn armen om haar heen en hield haar stevig vast tot ze zich weer veilig voelde. Maar ik zou ook denken aan die andere moeders in het zuiden van Isra√´l die geen macht hadden om hun kinderen veilig te houden, hoe stevig ze hen ook vasthielden. Vanochtend nog las ik een verslag over de forensische pathologen die bezig waren om de menselijke resten van het bloedbad te identificeren. Ze stuitten op een vorm die zo misvormd was dat ze pas na een CT-scan beseften dat het om twee afzonderlijke lichamen ging: een volwassene en een kind die elkaar stevig omhelsden terwijl ze verbrandden. Geliefd Isra√´l, mijn hart breekt voor jullie. Ik heb een zee van tranen. Maar tegelijkertijd voelen mijn tranen als een luxe waar ik geen recht op heb, want hier ben ik, veilig weg van het conflict, in staat om mijn twee gezonde kinderen te knuffelen en hen te laten weten dat ze veilig zijn. Ik heb geen theologie, geen wijsheid, geen verklaringen voor wat er is gebeurd. Misschien wel nooit. Ik voel geen behoefte of druk om er iets zinnigs over te zeggen. Ik wil God niet vragen waarom. Misschien weet ik dat als ik dat doe, ik alleen maar boos zal worden. Maar zonder te proberen iets te begrijpen, voel ik een diep gevoel van Gods aanwezigheid. Dat Hij op de een of andere manier in de duisternis mijn hand vasthoudt. En dat Hij ook huilt.

He could not be more right; Neymar ended up even worse than Ronaldinho. He did not succeed at PSG, had conflict with their fans, and now finds himself outside of the elite in Saudi Arabia. He earned a lot of money in his career, but zero important individual awards. With his injuries, parties, and other shenanigans, Neymar completely wasted his enormous talent. It was even proven three times this week, where he insulted the Brazilian Federation president, threatened not to play the next match, and had a private party with three women before their last match... in the same week that he became a father again.

facebook,"PPP denounces the ""senseless murder of innocent civilians"" in Palestine and Israel. See below statement by the PPP on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: The People‚Äôs Progressive Party (PPP) has historically stood in support of a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in keeping with UN resolution 242. Events of this last week have catapulted this issue onto the forefront of the global agenda once again, and require more urgent, determined, sustained, and unequivocal efforts by the United Nations (UN) and global leaders to realise this resolution. Hamas‚Äô attack on Israeli territory, and the subsequent Israeli aerial bombardment, as well as the consequential cutting off of all access to fuel, electricity, water, and medicine to the people of Gaza, have brought the status of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to its lowest levels in several decades. Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel has resulted in the loss of over 1,400 lives, including that of women and children. Meanwhile, the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has resulted in the deaths of over 2,600 Palestinians, many of whom are children and women. This violence against innocent civilians, on both sides, is unacceptable and the PPP unequivocally condemns it. Further, the Israeli air raids on Gaza have also resulted in the indiscriminate destruction of essential infrastructure, including UN centers, hospitals, and schools ‚Äì all in flagrant violation of international and humanitarian laws. At this dangerous juncture, there is a real threat that the conflict will escalate and engulf all of Palestine, as well as other parts of the Region. The People‚Äôs Progressive Party lends its unequivocal support to the statement by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ant√≥nio Guterres, on October 13, 2023, in which he called on Israel to stop the evacuation order of over one million people from the Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas in the world ‚Äì ‚Äúa territory already besieged under aerial bombardment without fuel, electricity, water and food.‚Äù The Secretary-General appealed to Israel to reconsider such actions, as it would have devastating humanitarian consequences. Also, the PPP welcomes the swift response by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The October 9, 2023 statement stressed that CARICOM joined ‚Äúresponsible members of the international community in calling for an immediate ceasefire and the end of hostilities by all parties. CARICOM continues to support UNSC Res 242 and the ongoing efforts towards a two-state solution as the best way to achieve comprehensive peace, security and tranquility between Israel and Palestine.‚Äù Additionally, statements by world leaders have urged Israel to withdraw the evacuation order for over a million Palestinians and for it to not reoccupy Gaza as its own. The PPP reiterates that it condemns the senseless killing of innocent civilians, particularly women and children, on both sides and supports the call for: ‚óè The immediate, rapid, and unimpeded humanitarian access throughout Gaza of fuel, food, medicine and water, etc., being allowed to enter; ‚óè An immediate reversal of the evacuation order by Israel of the Palestinians in Gaza; ‚Ä¢ All hostages in Gaza to be released; and ‚óè International humanitarian laws to be respected and upheld, and for civilians on both sides to be protected at all times. The world can no longer continue to turn a blind eye to the unacceptable conditions in which the Palestinians have been living for generations. The Palestinian people deserve a homeland in which they can live in freedom and dignity. The people of Israel also deserve to live in a country free from threats of violence and at peace with their neighbours. We believe that this can only be achieved in the context of a two-state solution.",,178,"{'like_count': 66, 'comment_count': 38, 'num_users': 210874}",Guyana Daily News,,2023-10-17 14:26:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/351136162_586730936902720_7168438177460032145_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=55W6A5SQfxIAX9qMEtp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDkcJ50YSWgYhR8sNHOke1YhIXpNNh4LDWD7Ff507oJxA&oe=655A8BF0,https://www.facebook.com/100083110822288/posts/320256104088081,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392768132_320256154088076_365671631495532984_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=de0UhNp01MwAX9fFbTN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD8ElXQbzE6VqvrQa13TQzMnraTaj7Afwk_DEYxzrjEsA&oe=653329C3

facebook,"AFRICA MARCHES FOR PALESTINE Amid growing international calls for a just and permanent solution to the Palestine-Israeli conflict, millions across the world have marched in solidarity with Palestine. We take a look at what that has looked like across African cities. For a continent that has endured centuries of slavery, colonisation and neocolonisation, it is obvious why many feel deeply about Palestine. From its creation in 1948 by Britain, Israel has subjected Palestinians to unspeakable horrors. From land dispossession, rationing of essentials like water, surveillance, imprisonment of children, destruction of crops and apartheid, the Zionist state has had free reign to abuse Palestinians with the complicity and enablement of the West. Following Palestinian resistance group Hamas' 7 October incursion and subsequent escalation of the struggle, Palestinian sovereignty is back on the front burner.

facebook,"Simple question, who would you prefer to have as neighbours, Jews or Muslims? Why? A small History lesson: 1.Israel became a nation and Jerusalem built in 1312 BC, two thousand years before the birth and growth of Islam. 2. Arab refugees began identifying themselves as Palestinians in 1967, twenty(!) years after the declaration of the modern state of Israel. 3. Since the Jewish capture of Canaan in 1272 B.C., the Jews have ruled the land for more than 1,000 years and have lived there for the last 3,300 years 4. The only time Arabs - since 635 B.C. have ruled this area was for no more than 22 years. 5. Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital for more than 3,000 years, and never the capital of any Arab or Muslim nation. Even when the Jordanians occupied Jerusalem, they never tried to make it the capital, and Arab leaders did not visit it. 6. Jerusalem is mentioned more than 700 times in the Tenach, the Jewish holy book, which Christians call the Old Testament. Jerusalem is not mentioned by name once in the Qur'an. 7. King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Muhammad never went there in his entire life. 8. About Arab and Jewish refugees: in 1948 Arab citizens were encouraged by Arab leaders to leave Israel, who promised them to cleanse the land of Jews. 68% of them left the country without ever seeing a single Israeli soldier. 9. Jewish refugees were forced to flee Arab countries due to threats, persecution and pogroms. 10. The number of Arab refugees who left Israel in 1948 is estimated at 630,000. The number of Jews who were forced to flee the Arab countries is estimated at a similar number. 11. Arab refugees were deliberately not absorbed and integrated into the Arab countries to which they fled, despite the very large Arab area. Of the hundred million refugees there have been since World War II, they are the only refugee group, who were never taken in and integrated by their own people. Jewish refugees, on the other hand, were fully assimilated and integrated into Israel. And that in an area that has only 9/10th of the area of the Netherlands. 12. The Arab - Israeli conflict: the Arabs are represented by 8 different nations, not counting the Palestinians. However, there is only one Jewish nation. The initiative of each of the five wars was with the Arab nations and they lost. Israel defended itself each time and won. 13. The PLO's charter still calls for the destruction of the State of Israel. Israel gave the Palestinians most of the West Bank, which is under the authority of the Palestinian Authority. 14. The UN was silent, however, when 58 synagogues in Jerusalem were destroyed by the Jordanians. 15. The UN was also silent when the Jordanians systematically violated and desecrated the Jewish graves on the Mount of Olives. 16. The UN was silent when the Jordanians enforced a kind of Apartheid policy in which they prevented Jews from visiting the most sacred Jewish sites of all: the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall. 17. Israel says: we are quite willing to recognize a state of Palestine, but there are certain conditions, one of which is that we are allowed to exist safely. Certain things have to happen so they don't keep attacking us. Last week shows (again) that this option is a long way off.",,162,"{'like_count': 93, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 77694}",Exposing islam,,2023-10-17 06:03:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/305997767_465238228978311_362350679659816052_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=iQEgP8VOKUYAX-QyEY3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAnsG8Xnr1AeWTrNtRyy1v95i8SD_qlsOto_2NAZDsYYg&oe=655AA4FA,https://www.facebook.com/100064764126876/posts/729218605913604,

He could not be more right; Neymar ended up even worse than Ronaldinho. He did not succeed at PSG, had conflict with their fans, and now finds himself outside of the elite in Saudi Arabia. He earned a lot of money in his career, but zero important individual awards. With his injuries, parties, and other shenanigans, Neymar completely wasted his enormous talent. It was even proven three times this week, where he insulted the Brazilian Federation president, threatened not to play the next match, and had a private party with three women before their last match... in the same week that he became a father again.

Water supplies only lasted for three hours, and only benefits 14 percent of 2.2 million population in Gaza Strip, the UN said on Monday. The UN recognizes that access to #water as a human right. The lack of clean water is putting lives in danger, raising concerns for #dehydration, and spread of #infections like cholera and dysentery, the UN says. Water supplies in the Gaza Strip rely on neighborhood #desalination facilities and public taps, as the region‚Äôs only aquifer is #contaminated by sewage, chemicals, and seawater. Even before the latest Israel-Hamas conflict, 90 percent of the water was undrinkable, according to the Palestinian Water Authority.

facebook,"Last night my Nigerian-American friend, Lotos Ada sent me a text in Igbo, her native language. ""Ndewo,"" she said. It means greetings, or hello. She's learning Igbo language ""small, small,"" she said, and she's enjoying the journey. And she also said she's been enjoying my social media posts about my family. I promised her I would do more posts about my family. So, here's another one. As I flipped through a folder in my bedroom thinking of what to share, I found this picture of my son, Malcolm, and my grandson Jakari. I love this photo: so much love, so much joy. I took this photograph about 18 years ago when Malcolm was standing outside our home talking to his buddy, Junior, who also had a son in his arms. I think about the power of transformation when I look at this photo. Jakari is now a freshman in college in Oregon. Malcolm is a successful businessman and father of two daughters and two sons. Malcolm was the catalyst for my spiritual transformation that led me to my initiation into Yoruba spiritual tradition of Nigeria many years ago. I said yes to transformation. Malcolm said yes to transformation too. I hope you will also yes to transformation. In this season of so much global conflict, endless wars and cycles of hate and injustice, it's important to focus our attention on what we can do, who we love, who loves us, who we can influence, and what legacy we wish to leave. Our children need us; the earth needs us, and we all need each other. I hope you find something in your day today that can fill your spirit with a bit more joy and love.

facebook,"CASE PROFILE Stella Farrugia was reported missing on Thursday 18 October 1984 by her boyfriend. He told police he last saw her at their home on Seaview Road, Henley Beach, the day before. There has not been a confirmed sighting of Stella since. The 18-year old has been described as outgoing, kind, and generous, but also a little na√Øve and easily led. The teenager had been raised in Sunshine, Victoria, and was the youngest child of Michael and Rose Farrugia who immigrated to Australia from Malta in the late-1950s. Her parents held strong beliefs on family matters arising from their traditional Maltese origins, with these conservative views often in conflict with those of the wider Australian community at the time, which often resulted in conflict within the family, particularly between Stella and her parents. It was against this backdrop that in late 1983 Stella unexpectedly moved to Queensland to stay with her older sister, Christine, who was newly married and living in Cairns. Stella got into a relationship and the young couple moved to Adelaide in 1984. The couple stayed at a number of addresses before moving to Henley Beach. After the relationship became strained, they split up and Stella moved in with another man, Wojciech Kubale, who reported her missing. Mr Kubale, who died in 2010, told police that he had been out for the day and came home to find her dog, bank books and personal possessions all at the flat ‚Äì but no sign of her. Initially police didn‚Äôt consider the matter suspicious ‚Äì they conducted inquiries but thought she had simply taken off. There was a suggested history of domestic violence in connection with both relationships, but there were no reports to police so it is hard to gauge to what extent. During this period she had written to her sister, demanding she make contact by a specific date and saying if she didn‚Äôt she would cut off all ties. That date came and went before her sister got around to replying, but sadly did not receive a response from Stella. It wasn‚Äôt until her boyfriend contacted the family to ask where she was that her disappearance was considered in a more concerning light and some weeks later they also reported her missing to the Sunshine Police. Another mysterious element to the case was that for several years after her disappearance Stella‚Äôs family received irregular phone calls where the caller did not speak when the phone was answered. The number of calls each year tapered off over time, finally stopping five or six years after she disappeared. Police have examined a number of properties, including the one at Mt Torrens where she stayed with her first boyfriend before moving to Henley Beach, but found no sign of her. Police believe there are two possible explanations in this case ‚Äì that Stella deliberately chose to move away and break all ties with her family, possibly with the assistance of someone who had offered to support her, or that she met with foul play. With pleas for information spanning many years, it seems more likely that she is deceased, given that she has not made contact with police or her family. Both of her boyfriends from that time remain persons of interest in the case, albeit one of them is now deceased. A reward of up to $200,000 is on offer to anyone who provides information leading to the recovery of her remains or information leading to a conviction in the case.

We decree God's peace and blessing rests upon Israel and Jerusalem. We declare peace to her borders and that all enemy fire shall cease. We ask for angelic reinforcements to bring protection to the walls of Israel and that its places of government shall remain safe. We break the power of all dread, fear, and terror among the people. We say they shall not fear attacks, bombings, missiles, and foreign invasion. We prophesy that their homes, streets, businesses, and historical sites shall be protected. We declare that Israel's land shall remain secure, and no politicians or governments of the earth shall be able to enact agreements or accords that take their land away. We say that Jerusalem belongs to God. We speak strength to the state of Israel. We prophesy that a prosperity from the Lord rests upon it and the Jewish people. Israel belongs to God and Israel is forever. We declare that the Gospel of Jesus Christ shall shine in Israel and many shall come to the way of salvation. May the United States of America never break its alliance with Israel. We bind every effort by the government to detach from Israel, and we declare that America shall always defend Israel and seek its good. We pray for the defeat and destruction of Islamist terrorist invaders. We pray for the physical rescue of Israelis under siege, those who are kidnapped, those who are wounded. We pray for divine wisdom and decisive strategy to be given to Israel's leaders in every area. We pray that God will break the arrows and bow of the enemy, and for supernatural protection for Israel against all rockets and missile attacks from God and his angels. We pray that Israel‚Äôs enemies will be confused and will turn and flee. We pray for salvation and revival to break out in Israel. We pray that they would come to know Jesus as their true Messiah. We pray that their eyes would be opened to see the love and light of Jesus in the middle of their darkest hour. God we declare that this conflict will not escalate into World War 3. We declare that it will end quickly and every attempt of the enemy to turn it into something more is cancelled in Jesus‚Äô name. We pray for peace in Israel and worldwide. In Jesus‚Äô name we pray‚Ä¶ üôèüèºüôèüèº Amen üôèüèºüôèüèº",,147,"{'like_count': 73, 'comment_count': 32, 'num_users': 2430039}",Believe in Jesus Christ,,2023-10-17 13:57:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/309389716_408228934820986_940117365861230257_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rFQNFbhGn8wAX_KObpK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBT2MvkdSNp40G_YYy0ZQlSQT6vbNyW1dZ1hpJqBb1zJw&oe=655B19DA,https://www.facebook.com/100069016478283/posts/641209314856279,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391621118_641209214856289_6891827473243689957_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=HXZe3MvduaoAX9IJgDD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAzIkyR1EziJHMGnyrVjKQn2LSTz4mMULaViIP5rqN_Lg&oe=654AB877

In the face of ongoing conflict and violence, we are summoned to turn our hearts and minds to God, seeking solace, strength, and a pathway to peace. Cardinal Pizzaballa implores all Catholics to gather in prayer, embracing moments of Eucharistic adoration and the recitation of the rosary. Through our collective appeal, we aim to call upon God the Father to quench our thirst for peace, justice, and reconciliation amidst the turmoil we witness. This solemn day of prayer and fasting seeks to uplift the hearts burdened by sorrow and dismay. We refuse to let despair be our only response to the challenges before us. As children of God, we have the power to unite in prayer, interceding for peace and beseeching divine guidance during these difficult times. Furthermore, we stand in solidarity with our fellow Catholics around the world who have pledged to join in this fast for peace in the Holy Land, demonstrating our global unity and shared commitment to seeking peace and reconciliation. Let us pray for the innocent lives lost and the hostages held captive, beseeching God's mercy and guidance for a resolution that ensures the dignity and freedom of all. May our fasting and prayers contribute to a termination of violence, opening the door to dialogue, understanding, and reconciliation between conflicting parties. May God's peace prevail in the Holy Land.",,144,"{'like_count': 46, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 137895}",Jesuit Communications,,2023-10-17 03:50:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/340962748_906420723961333_4574600404142403030_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3dLaKEzhgRcAX_LI3Mz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB90Oa0XpqDeOSa5-ANohRfB1tb45Qy4XLzs8KrUwenvw&oe=655A10F6,https://www.facebook.com/100064942861742/posts/707379481436808,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392951269_707378884770201_3179897854490554785_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=0tVNPkggER4AX_1E4m_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBa2OwcO4_YLBxqXRZD7geNNL_OsEqEeGVhYriYr2qCFw&oe=653E35F5

facebook,"Hello Biafrans, read this quickly before Facebook shut it down. Hamas is one of the agitating group seeking for the freedom of Palestine. Of course there is nothing wrong in asking for your freedom, but Hamas got it wrong when they invaded Israel and start killing innocent people without provocation. As I said before, there is nothing wrong agitating for your freedom peacefully. The world turned against Hamas when they start killing innocent civilians. IPOB and every Biafra agitating groups should learn from the terrible mistake of Hamas. In no circumstances should we touch or harm innocent unarmed civilians. You see why DOS are very careful, you see why they are guiding and protecting IPOB from government infiltrators. Innocent people should be protected always mostly women and children. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu warned us that we MUST never give our enemy the reason to demonize what we are doing. Hamas gave Isreal the reason to demonize and destroy them. The honest truth is that, the action of hamas against Israel is pure terrorism, you don't invade people's home, murdered them, murdered kids, took women and children hostage and expect the world to support you, only an insane will support that . You cannot blame Israel because they have capitalised in the costly mistake of Hamas to invent their anger. Before the world will succeed in camling and stopping Israel, the damages will be immense. Let us not follow the conflict without learning something that will guide and protect our quest for freedom.-- MEG",,143,"{'like_count': 79, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 98610}",IPOB Community Radio,,2023-10-17 06:51:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/345602963_766240691637292_6217445795280473966_n.jpg?stp=c0.5.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=avFoXidgU3QAX9b4L5N&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAW_FmbZNNRJ-iYKNtz55MbZWeQ4EaGj4DxEPzk6Sxlbg&oe=655B4E63,https://www.facebook.com/groups/389652248926164/permalink/1008269120397804,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392743091_770422024851919_8102817439573292468_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CZO_sXIrBKQAX8_tOWc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAfGMconP5Ge75byxKvRfZkIcz9S79zhkQXhBgwapACcg&oe=65333CB5

instagram,"In her memoir, titled The Woman in Me, Britney Spears writes about something she describes as ‚Äúone of the most agonizing things‚Äù she‚Äôs ever experienced: an abortion.

‚ÄúIt was a surprise, but for me, it wasn‚Äôt a tragedy. I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I‚Äôd anticipated,‚Äù the pop icon shares. But Justin Timberlake was not ready to be a father, and the two ultimately decided it wasn‚Äôt the right time. ‚ÄúBut Justin definitely wasn‚Äôt happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren‚Äôt ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young.""

In the excerpt from her memoir, Britney goes on to express the inner conflict she felt, highlighting that, had the decision been solely up to her, she might not have chosen to undergo the abortion: ""If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn‚Äôt want to be a father.‚Äù The memoir releases in just a week, and stories like this are exactly why a woman telling her story on her own terms is so important. 

Britney Spears' upcoming memoir has been highly anticipated, not only for its insights into her personal life but also because it‚Äôs testament to the importance of individuals being able to tell their stories on their own terms, particularly for someone who has been under the scrutiny of the media and held under a conservatorship for much of her career.

Though she describes and recollects many of the traumatic things she‚Äôs experienced in her life for the memoir, she‚Äôs previously shared that writing it and looking back at her past was ‚Äúhealing and therapeutic‚Äù for her. After learning this story, though, we can only look back at her career and wonder how her personal experiences may have influenced her creative work. It‚Äôs not hard to imagine that the scene in the hospital room in Everytime music video could‚Äôve been about this experience‚Ä¶

instagram,"On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel‚Äôs bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.‚Äù

instagram,"Dear Meta Company
What kind of hate speech or guidelines Violation did i cross?!!
Is this the freedom of opinion that Meta company & the free west world pretends to embrace?!!

My words were just a reminder of some historical facts..
Facts you and your leaders want to ignore..

A truth that you wish to wipe !

Seriously you really want us to remain silent while we are now watching these humane massacres of our brothers ,meanwhile watching you since years enjoy messing with our minds and deforming our future generations and with all the audacity you want to change the historical facts

It is no longer about the conflict between Pale_stine and Isr_ael now
As the fate of this conflict is already settled and known to us historically and religiously

It's now about the CAGE you always want to keep us inside 

About the LIMITS you designed and we are not allowed to cross them

About the constant feeling that we are less valuable, less important, and less human

May be i have crossed some limits from your  pathetic  point of view
But to be honest, I am glad 
I am glad for what you did, it exposed your double standards,

Exposed your fake mask of values and morals..

Your fake mask of democracy and human rights
Fake mask of freedom of speech
Fake mask of anti discrimination & anti racism..

And the lie continues..
That you are the Culprit who always shown as innocent..
And We are the victims who always framed guilty.

instagram,"I am a ""warrior of light"", but don't forget that that title starts with warrior.

This picture was taken after 4 days of fighting Hamas terrorists in the Kfar Aza, one of hardest hit communities on the border of Gaza that was annihilated by the terrorists, moments before our unit‚Äôs arrival. 

In front of me is the Kotz family house, one of the countless families that were executed and who‚Äôs bodies were found lifeless, yet still embracing each other in their last moments.

Their next door neighbors were also a family of 5, where the two parents were shot dead, but two of the daughters were hidden in a closet and later found and saved by IDF special forces. Unfortunately, the third child who‚Äôs a baby is still missing.

Many are trying to deny the savagery and gruesome slaughter that took place in these communities, but I saw it first hand. Hundreds of bodies shot, stabbed, burn, blown up, dragged and cut to pieces are seared in my memory for eternity.

This not only happened, but it‚Äôs worse than you can ever imagine. Woman were raped with objects to death as Hamas lit their babies on fire in front of them.

There was no mercy here. There was no humanity here.

There are still around 200 civilians kidnapped and trapped in Gaza, men, women, elderly and children, and who knows what‚Äôs happening to them.

Am Israel is here to bring light into this world, but it‚Äôs time to clear the storm for the sun to shine bright again. Israelis & Palestinians do not deserve the consequences of evil forces that drive those who make decisions, profit from conflict, and push hateful rhetoric that make people lose their consciousness.

Am Israel is here to be a light onto the nations and I work daily to fulfill this purpose, but if we‚Äôre forced to fight off a virus like Hamas to make sure life and light can exist, then we will.

instagram,"Jewish anti-war groups @ifnotnoworg and @jewishvoiceforpeace held a protest outside the White House on October 16, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict. 49 demonstrators were arrested by the Secret Service during the event: 33 people on 'suspicion of unlawful entry' and 16 for 'allegedly incommoding,' Special Agent Steve Kopek told Axios.

The protests come amid Biden's announcement of a trip to Israel and an expected Israeli ground offensive in Gaza. The groups join a growing list of Jewish activists in New York, Chicago, and other major cities in protesting the war and denouncing any justification of violence in the name of Judaism. More protests from Jewish anti-war groups are planned throughout this week.

instagram,"Popular Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor is the latest celebrity to break the silence on the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel. The war has claimed thousands of innocent lives to date but tension escalated after Hamas launched an unprecedented strike on Israel this month.

Various celebrities across the globe have reacted to the conflict but Sonam Kapoor is the only Bollywood actress after Swara Bhasker who spoke on the issue. Taking to her Instagram story, she said that half of the people in Gaza are children. She also shared an excerpt from the New York Time op-ed which is written by eminent columnist Nicholas Kristof. Tennis star Sania Mirza too shared the same post on her Instagram.

instagram,"World News:
Iran‚Äôs leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has condemned Israel's actions in Gaza, terming it as ""genocide.""

Khamenei stressed the need to immediately cease the ""bombardments"" that killed thousands of civilians. He warned, ""If the crimes continue, Muslims will be impatient, resistance forces will be impatient, and nobody will be able to prevent them,"" he warned.

While Iran openly praised Hamas's recent attacks against Israel, it has refuted claims of direct involvement in the attacks. This sentiment was echoed by French President Emanuel Macron, who said he found no evidence pointing to Iran's assistance to Hamas.

The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in the deaths of over 1,400 Israelis and 2,800 Palestinians, including at least 1,000 Palestinian children (as reported by Al Jazeera). Continuous airstrikes have caused massive displacements, affecting more than a million residents in Gaza City.

Francesca Albanese, a UN Special Rapporteur, expressed deep concern over these developments, highlighting that such actions could verge on ""ethnic cleansing"" of Palestinians.

Another view: 
Despite criticism, Israel maintains that they are doing everything possible to mitigate civilian deaths. They argue that Hamas militants use civilians as human shields and purposely hide weapons and top officials in/near heavily populated civilian infrastructure. In the last 12 hours, the IDF says that Hamas commander Ayman Nofal was killed in an airstrike at the Bureij refugee camp. The Hamas military wing verified his death but did not confirm if he died in a refugee camp.",,12703,"{'like_count': 11719, 'comment_count': 984, 'num_users': 966663}","Real News, Not Bullshit",,2023-10-17 18:48:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/210871732_2297447983890016_8350712253230690398_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nBbjySDBVlQAX87JSho&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBk14T-MaDPBNwPwWX3loRBZR46eror1wY2VFxIvbBxVg&oe=6559C8F0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CygrP0jPCzG/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392899573_715106983992801_4840556274448111745_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=w9RGpkVklbYAX-5uTqr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA3EegSzxBOsPnDthdLOBkcLeKCIWytACHfaTs_2v0xLw&oe=654138D5

Social media has long played a critical role in battles in the area. During the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021, posts of carnage in Gaza rallied the public to the Palestinian cause. Researchers say increased internet access and the spread of smartphones enabled a watershed moment, revealing how tech platforms could show the horror and human toll of such events.

But now, tech platforms, diminished from waves of layoffs, have receded from policing falsehoods, disinformation and hate speech online. And unlike in 2021, Palestinians in Gaza are already losing access to the internet, compromising their ability to tell their story.

‚Äú[There are] body parts and dismembered corpses of children and women, young and old,‚Äù Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Wael Al-Dahdouh said in the aftermath of the attack targeting al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

At the time of the strike, the hospital was giving treatment and shelter to hundreds of Palestinians wounded and displaced by Israel‚Äôs ongoing bombardment campaign since 7 October.

The ministry said 200 people have been killed but the number is likely higher as 500 casualties were reported. The civil defence said at least 300 have been killed.

Mahmoud Bassal, the civil defence spokesperson in Gaza, said the ‚Äúmassacre‚Äù left the hospital‚Äôs floor ‚Äúcovered in dead bodies‚Äù with first responders struggling to pick them up.

‚ÄúIt is a pogrom. It is unprecedented throughout the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,‚Äù Bassal said. ‚ÄúGaza is now a big cemetery, what is happening is madness, what happened in Deir Yassin is happening now but worse. Children‚Äôs limbs are scattered on the ground.

‚ÄúWhen will the world stand up for Gaza?‚Äù

Ashraf al-Qudra, the spokesperson of the health ministry, said hundreds of wounded people remain scattered across the floor.

instagram,"What happened: During the FIFA Qualifier match between Pakistan and Cambodia at Jinnah Stadium in Islamabad, an unexpected controversy unfolded. As the world watches the Is.rael -Pales.tine conflict with intense interest, sentiments of support for Pales.tine were raised in the stadium through the display of Pale.stinian flags by numerous spectators.

However, authorities, including ICT police, FIFA officials, and the Pakistan Football Federation, intervened by asking the flag bearers to remove and fold the flags. This request was met with limited compliance due to the high number of people involved. 

Some individuals have questioned this incident, considering it peculiar, given Pakistan's historical support for Pales.tine in the ongoing conflict.

Opinion: The incident raised questions about the authorities' action. While maintaining a neutral standpoint, it's important to recognize that the specific reasons for this action remain unclear. It could be related to stadium regulations, concerns about potential disturbances, or an attempt to ensure the focus remained on the sporting event rather than politics.

instagram,"SERIOUSLY THOUGH: In a groundbreaking declaration that has sent shockwaves throughout the diplomatic community, a stoned uni kid watching tiktok videos of violence in the middle east has suggested the solution to end the generational conflict raging overseas, is to simply chill out.

Will Chester (22), A man that isn‚Äôt really into the news and is more of a ‚Äòback of the newspaper kind of guy‚Äô, as he says, has recently noticed some things going on in the Middle East.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know anything about what‚Äôs going on but it‚Äôs hectic hey?‚Äù Will proclaimed.

With an unprecedented escalation to the violence in Israel and Palestine not seen since the 90s and saber rattling coming from regional powers on both sides of the conflict, it seems like peace in the region is further away than it has ever been in our lifetime, but Will sees things differently.

‚ÄúLike, I really just think everyone needs to chill out a bit‚Äù he says.

Although Will has zero knowledge in the conflict and repeatedly referenced the South Asian nation of Afghanistan as though it is somehow in the same region as this conflict, he remains committed to his peace deal.

‚ÄúLike seriously‚Äù he says.

While Will‚Äôs answer to solving this highly complicated ethno-religious tug of war that has been unfolding over several decades has left reporters baffled, one thing is certain, there‚Äôs not going to be any less conflict until at least someone chills out.

Kurilla told Reuters that ‚ÄúI'm here to ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself, particularly focused on avoiding other parties expanding the conflict.‚Äù

He also stated that he is meeting IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.

Meanwhile, two carrier strike groups are positioning themselves off the coast in the Mediterranean, which US defense officials have described as a deterrent against Hezboll@h and #Iran.

The UN agency warned about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, saying it could be a long-term humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave.

Confirming obstruction of aid into Gaza by the Israeli government, the WHO informed that over 115 attacks took place on healthcare sectors in Gaza, with a majority of hospitals unfunctional because of the unavailability of resources.

WHO representative in the occupied Palestine region Dr. Richard Peeperkon informed since October 7, the war has claimed thousands of innocent lives. In Gaza alone, the war has killed 2,800 people and wounded 11,000 people. Of which, about half are women and children, he said.

instagram,"My heart has been heavy and my thoughts have been with the people of Palestine. A land rich in history, steeped in faith, and resilient in the face of adversity. A land that has endured the winds of conflict and the storms of occupation for far too long. This isn't about politics or religion, but about humanity. Regardless of where we come from or what we believe in, we must all stand for justice, for peace, and for the sanctity of human life. 

The people of Palestine are more than just headlines or statistics. They are mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, dreamers and doers, who deserve to live in dignity, freedom, and peace. They deserve a future where fear does not shadow their every step, where the night brings dreams, not dread, and where their rights as a human are respected and protected.

It's time for us to use our voices to shine a light on the ongoing plight of Palestinians. To speak out against the injustices they face daily. To advocate for their right to self-determination. To pray for an end to their suffering.

As we scroll through our feeds from the comfort of our homes, let's remember those who are living amidst the rubble, those whose lives hang in the balance, and those whose stories of courage and perseverance inspire us.

May we never lose sight of our shared humanity. May we stand in solidarity with the oppressed, no matter where they are.

In Plainfield Township, Will County, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Chicago, their landlord attacked them on Saturday.

instagram,"New Delhi: A delegation of 16 opposition leaders from the INDIA alliance met the Palestinian Ambassador in New Delhi on Monday and expressed solidarity with Palestinians during the ongoing conflict. They also passed a resolution emphasising the international community‚Äôs role in ensuring the rights and dignity of Palestinian people.

‚ÄúThe international community must exert pressure on Israel to abide by international laws and respect the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people,‚Äù the delegation‚Äôs resolution stated, according to The Indian Express. ‚ÄúWe strongly condemn the indiscriminate bombing of Palestinians in Gaza by Israel, which we believe amounts to an attempt to genocide. We urge an immediate cessation of all hostilities to prevent further loss of innocent lives and the destruction of homes and infrastructure.‚Äù

The opposition leaders said that the international community should recognise the state of Palestine along the 1967 borders in accordance with the UN resolution. ‚ÄúSuch recognition is a crucial step towards ensuring a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestine conflict,‚Äù the resolution stated.

‚ÄúThe Government of India doesn‚Äôt want the voice of people to be known and that is very, very problematic. So, we thought that we should let the Palestinian ambassador know that there is also a different voice in India‚Äîthe general voice of the people is for peace, for the Palestinian people‚Äôs right to their homeland,‚Äù Dipankar Bhattacharya, CPI (ML) general secretary, said, according to Hindustan Times.

‚ÄúThe government is almost keeping quiet now and this amounts to endorsing Israel‚Äôs project of genocide‚Äîwhich is a huge departure in terms of foreign policy,‚Äù he continued.

instagram,"Dear Friends,

Today, I speak to you with a heart heavy as lead, struggling to hold back tears. In Palestine, a human tragedy is unfolding that defies comprehension.

In just the past week, over 6,000 bombs have shattered the fragile peace of this region, more than what the entire United States dropped on Afghanistan in a year. Families have been torn from their homes, and now, two million souls are huddled together in an overcrowded corner of Gaza. The one route of escape, the Egyptian border, has been cruelly reduced to rubble.

Palestine, already stripped of electricity and water, now faces the insufferable agony of white phosphorus contamination. Hospitals overflow with the wounded and the deceased, and they've even asked to evacuate the hospitals. But how can they evacuate with casualties, including tiny babies? The very places meant to provide healing have become targets themselves.

Ambulance vans, once symbols of salvation, have become targets as well. The roads are lined with lifeless bodies, and there's no space left to provide them a dignified resting place.
Even a warehouse of the International Aid Campaign(IAC), a beacon of hope in the darkest of times, has not been spared the wrath of violence.

What cuts deepest is the knowledge that we seem to have learned nothing from our shared history. The world stands by, silent witnesses to this suffering. It's not about religion; it's about our shared humanity.

This, dear friends, is not just a conflict; it is a desperate cry for empathy and compassion. We must stand together, across all borders and beliefs, to demand an immediate end to this devastating crisis.

With a heart heavy, 
Fitfazil

Hamas killed around 1200 innocent Israelis, some of them children, and took many hostages which is an atrocity that I condemn. All hostages should be returned. Israeli children are currently living in fear. But in response, the Israeli government decided to cut off food, water and electricity to 2 million Palestinians, half of which are children, and are carpet bombing their land with thousands of bombs. While the target might be Hamas, the civilian population is suffering though a living hell.

Israel should absolutely defend its people from Hamas, but indiscriminately bombing and starving an entire population is not proportionate. 

The UN has called this a crime against humanity and a violation of international law. 

The long-term solution is to see all of humanity as one people. Until we genuinely feel this in our hearts, there will be no love because minds will continue to divide and fight.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, people were using the hospital both for medical treatment and as a shelter when the missile struck. Hamas has been known to use these hospitals as headquarters, and a place to also store weapons.

Who did it? Israel says the explosion was due to a failed Palestinian Islamic Jihad missile launch. This is backed up by Arab news outlets and journalists who note the blast happened right after Islamic Jihad said it was firing missiles. 

Context: This wouldn't be the first time a missile mishap from Palestinian extremists led to fatalities in Gaza. Failed launches have previously hit within the territory, killing Palestinians.

from @mohammedelkurd:

On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel‚Äôs bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.‚Äù

instagram,"Too often we're reactive because we're hurt while also using our anger to control others.

I am of the belief the anger is also showing you where you're being disrespected. 

And because I believe in allowing people to have ""bad days"", we can give them grace and see how they move as we go forward.

Letting them cook allows you to take a moment, breathe and watch how they handle situations where they think you're not paying attention or they have the upper hand because you're not being reactive.

After all, they're used to women/partners who ""go off"" and now you're showing them how easy you are to control.

They want to dip out and spend time with another love interest? 

They know to start an argument, because you'll get reactive and curse them out - they disappear for days to punish you as they get the time to spend with someone else. 

This explains the random, dumb arguments that seemingly pop up out of the blue.

The disappearing for days and ignoring your calls is your ""let them cook"" moment.

Now you're seeing how they handle conflict.

But when you're being reactive, angry, controlling, demanding and giving ultimatums - you're not paying attention to what they'd rather do.

And this is where acceptance slides in. 

In doing this you learn to accept people for who they are without personalizing it.

Detach with love, because we're not doing this anymore.

Because there's a life where you wake up completely at peace, anxiety free, not hung up on someone's inability to call you back in a respectable time period, using your pain against you or tolerating head games that leave you angry and confused.

That's where my Inner Circle comes in.

üåü This is your invitation to join a sisterhood of healing women who are rewriting their narratives, while giving you the tools to transform your relationships, most importantly the one with yourself.

Imagine no longer falling into these nasty cycles of painful relationships while having a tribe of resilient women by your side who are on the same journey as you are.

instagram,"A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military said the hospital was hit by a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants.

In protest over the purported airstrike, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas canceled his participation in a meeting with Biden, Jordan‚Äôs King Abdullah II and Egypt‚Äôs president set for Wednesday in Amman, Jordan to discuss the war. 

Later, Jordan‚Äôs foreign minister told state-run television that Jordan had canceled the summit, saying that the war between Israel and Hamas was ‚Äúpushing the region to the brink.‚Äù He said the meeting would be postponed.

The comments emerged as Biden boarded the plane for his Mideast trip, which in part aims to prevent the war from sparking a broader regional conflict.

instagram,"I was always wishy-washy in my relationships. I was ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù to my partner but subconsciously had one foot out the door in case it didn‚Äôt work out. In a sense, this was helpful because I always had savings, kept my individuality, and maintained my independence. On the other hand, I wasn‚Äôt fully invested in the future of our relationship, was self-absorbed in my needs, and anything that went ‚Äúwrong‚Äù made me question the entirety of our love. We were always on thin ice.

When I learned about my attachment style years ago, it made sense why I was so protective of myself. My belief that love would abandon or betray me caused much of the ambivalence I was experiencing.

Though I thought I was doing myself a favor by taking this protective approach, I realized it was causing so much of the anxiety, disconnection, and conflict we were experiencing.

Though I still have doubts that surface occasionally, I make the conscious choice (daily) to commit to my relationship values (i.e., growth, commitment, partnership, support, individuality, respect, communication, honesty, to name a few).

This doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm now susceptible to being mistreated or taken advantage of. It just means I can be fully committed while knowing my boundaries.

Understanding what‚Äôs most important to us can help redirect our attention when we feel lost, uncertain, or in doubt.

instagram,"Cognitive dissonance can contribute to the development of a trauma bond, especially in relationships with narcissists. A trauma bond is a strong emotional connection that forms between a person and someone who is harmful or abusive. In the context of narcissistic relationships, the inconsistency between the narcissist's charming facade and their hurtful behavior creates cognitive dissonance. This internal conflict, combined with intermittent reinforcement of positive attention, can deepen emotional ties and make it difficult for the person to break away from the relationship, despite the harm caused. The trauma bond often involves a cycle of idealization, devaluation, and intermittent reinforcement that keeps the person emotionally attached, even in the face of negative experiences.",,3759,"{'like_count': 3688, 'comment_count': 71, 'num_users': 342039}",narcissistrecovery,,2023-10-17 13:24:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/14032828_680097195471104_1898315166_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=DoJkc_iuJTQAX8_3QgN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBdBFmyGCnhEmUo6Zi9lvXiRGOBep_lDVxo0WBL3ezi9w&oe=655A7CD2,https://www.instagram.com/p/CygGIiHuI1L/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392888241_1912883589108864_8646388375441250127_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EVw_yZMmIDsAX-q3IXk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDoY7rSg6Z2tcUsMqM6z5Mf-wa4IbGpJXa0zfGw0bYrRQ&oe=655A2CB9
instagram,"Do you feel like your desire for your partner disappeared after you had a baby? 
 
Many new moms experience fluctuation in desire. This makes sense‚Äìwe‚Äôre navigating hormone shifts, sleep deprivation, and a vulnerable time for our mental health. 
 
But research shows that there‚Äôs another big factor at play in low sex drive for moms‚Äìthe division of labor. 
 
A recent study suggests that when women carry an unfair proportion of household labor, they often have a significantly lower sexual desire for their partner.* 
 
When moms are carrying more than their fair share of the invisible load, they might come to view their partner as a dependent and build resentment over the distribution of labor. (Which doesn‚Äôt exactly set the mood for desire or arousal!) 
 
The good news is that if you find yourself in that situation, it isn‚Äôt hopeless! 
 
When we become aware of what is leading to resentment and conflict, it becomes easier to address it productively. 
 
If you‚Äôre not sure where to start, working with a mom therapist can help!

instagram,"Whether you realize it or not, you‚Äôre always in a growth process.

This process is defined by the relationship between your self-awareness right now, and a new, more expanded version of yourself trying to emerge.

Sometimes, the meeting of these two processes leads to an easy, liberating transformation; you sense a needed change and are able to do it. 

But more often, your current consciousness blocks the required change. This creates conflict, tension, and pain.

If your mind can‚Äôt accept, is afraid of, isn‚Äôt ready yet, or is simply unaware of how you need to grow, it forces the basic emotion driving your growth to mutate.

Instead of experiencing power or creativity or playfulness or whatever is trying to emerge into your consciousness, the raw emotion behind the new process manifests as a disturbance, a problem, a ‚Äúsymptom.‚Äù

The fundamental emotion driving your issue is right, but it manifests in a negative way. 

Conventional mental health practice misses the mark by just trying to suppress your pain‚Äîthe disturbing manifestation of your process. Doing so, throws out the baby with the bathwater.

Instead, you must learn how to reverse the mutation, uncover the hidden emotion driving your feelings, thoughts, and actions. This leads to liberation and expansion‚Äîthe true purpose of your problems. Just trying to get rid of your issue may reduce discomfort but it kills your growth.

Your problem is your process!

Behind your nasty inner critic, impossible relationship, depression, anxiety, attention deficit, delusions, mood swings, health issues, or boredom is an unseen emotion, a felt sense, a creative power, a new understanding and self-awareness pushing forth, trying with all its blind might to become a conscious awareness in your psyche.

No matter how bad your problem is, don‚Äôt dismiss it as a meaningless error in your life, an ‚Äúillness,‚Äù a pathology to ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù and ‚Äútreat""; always keep faith and belief in that fact that it has a meaningful message, and keep working to connect with its potent, hidden emotion.

instagram,"U.S. President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit Israel on Wednesday to express support for its efforts in the conflict with Hamas. This visit follows an agreement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow humanitarian aid to reach the besieged Gaza Strip. 

Vital supplies for Gaza, carried by around 160 trucks, arrived at the Rafah crossing in Egypt, the only access point to Gaza outside of Israel's control. Israel's military actions in response to Hamas attacks have resulted in the deaths of over 2,800 Palestinians and forced half of Gaza's 2.3 million population from their homes. 

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after discussions with Netanyahu, confirmed Biden's visit and highlighted the importance of providing humanitarian assistance to Gazan civilians while minimizing civilian casualties.

instagram,"Days before Hamas launched its assault on Israel and brutally massacred hundreds of civilians, I half-joked to a friend that ‚Äúno one cares about the Middle East anymore.‚Äù I said this as a lament. I spoke too soon. About a week before Hamas‚Äôs attack, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan boasted to an audience that under the Biden administration‚Äôs watch, ‚Äúthe Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.‚Äù He also spoke too soon.

The Middle East never stays quiet. If the deeper sources of violent conflict in the region are left to fester, any peace and quiet will pass as quickly as it came. A dose of humility is in order.

By chance, as Israel intensified its bombardment of Gaza, I found myself at a summit on ‚Äúintellectual humility‚Äù hosted by the John Templeton Foundation. It felt self-indulgent to discuss a philosophical concept with seemingly little relevance to the conflict. When it came to life and death, did any of this really matter? But what I found was that it did.

Intellectual humility is a trait and a practice that allows one to accept their own limitations. Even if we think we are right, it entails holding open the possibility that we might be wrong. But on a deeper level, humility involves the recognition that the truth itself is more complicated than it might first appear.

The search for truth, even if one finds it, should not involve rigidity. We are all a product of our environments. When it comes to Israel and Palestine in particular, we bring our own preconceptions to any debate ‚Äî our own selective read of history and our own developed sense of injustice. This is not about a disagreement over facts; it‚Äôs about how to interpret them. My hope is that more Americans will understand this, considering how much we disagree with one another over our own founding as a nation.

My heart aches when I remember visiting al-Ahli hospital in 2018 during Holy Week to meet the medical teams and all the people of that remarkable ministry. They were passionately committed to anyone who had need.

I know personally how faithful Episcopalians are in praying. During my surgery and recovery, you have prayed for me and for my healing, and I am more grateful and thankful than words can say. 

Right now, I ask you to pray fervently for the birthplace of the Abrahamic faiths and for all its people. Pray for those who have been hurt, harmed, or killed‚Äîregardless of who they are or who did it.

Pray also for the leaders and people of the entire region, that they will remember God‚Äôs mercy, and that they will find the way to a just peace where all may live in safety and security as God intends. 

Pray this week for President Biden, that he may be an advocate for immediate humanitarian access for those who desperately need food, water, and medicine‚Äîand for comfort and consolation for those who have been displaced and those who are grieving loved ones.

Please join me in praying:

Eternal God, in whose perfect kingdom no sword is drawn
but the sword of righteousness, no strength known but the
strength of love: So mightily spread abroad your Spirit, that
all peoples may be gathered under the banner of the Prince of
Peace, as children of one Father; to whom be dominion and
glory, now and forever. Amen.

instagram,"For those who might not be aware, Dua has been a strong supporter of the people in Palestine for a long time. She doesn't just express her thoughts on social media, but also through her newsletter, where she shares resources to help. Dua stays well-informed about global injustices and promptly condemns any form of misconduct.

In her latest post about the Palestine-Israel conflict, she faced a lot of negative comments, even from some of her own ""fans"" who might not fully understand the situation or have misinterpreted Dua's message. The suffering of the Palestinian people isn't a recent problem; it's been years of innocent lives lost at the hands of the Israeli government without compassion. It's a daily nightmare for Palestinian individuals, including children.

Just to be clear, this isn't endorsing any acts of terrorism by Hamas against innocent Israelis. Not at all. But it's essential to realize that the actions of one group shouldn't define the whole Palestinian population, who shouldn't bear the consequences. The number of innocent lives lost due to Israeli government actions is heartbreaking. Can we not see this?

Supporting the Palestinian people doesn't mean you have to hate Israelis. It's crucial for all of us to stay informed and support those who are suffering.

instagram,"A 6-year-old boy is dead, and his mother seriously wounded after they were both stabbed more than a dozen times due to their Muslim faith Saturday in a Chicago suburb.

Around 11:38 a.m., deputies with the Will County Sheriff's Office responded to a home located near the intersection of S. Lincoln Highway and Lily Cache Road in Plainfield for a report of a stabbing.

A 32-year-old woman had called 9-1-1 and stated her landlord had attacked her with a knife, and that she ran into the bathroom and continued to fight off her attacker as she dialed 9-1-1.

When officers arrived at the scene, they located the suspect ‚Äì identified as 71-year-old Joseph M. Czuba ‚Äì sitting on the ground outside the home with a laceration to his forehead. He was transported to an area hospital for treatment.

Inside the home, in a bedroom, police say they located two victims who had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso, and upper extremities. The 32-year-old woman was hospitalized in serious condition with over a dozen stab wounds to her body. A 6-year-old boy had also suffered 26 stab wounds throughout his body and was pronounced dead at the hospital.

The knife used in the attack was seven inches long and serrated.

Czuba was treated and released from the hospital, and taken by police for questioning. He was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

""Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,"" according to the Will County Sheriff's Office.

The weapon used in this ""heinous crime"" was recovered, police said.

South African #PresidentCyrilRamaphosa expressed solidarity with Palestinians on Saturday in a video posted on X.

‚ÄúThe main way to address the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is to implement the two-state solution and establish an independent Palestinian state,‚Äù Ramaphosa said in the clip, wearing the Palestinian Kufiyah -- an icon of Palestinian resistance.

""We extend our condolences to the families of the civilian victims during the recent clashes on both sides (#Gaza Strip and Israel),"" he said.

‚ÄúThe #Israeli order to evacuate more than a million people from northern Gaza to its south would make the matter worse,"" he said.

He affirmed ""South Africa's solidarity with the Palestinian people and its support for a peaceful solution,‚Äù and stressed that ""a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine will reflect positively on the entire Middle East.""

The Gaza Strip, which has been besieged since 2006, has been subjected to intense Israeli air strikes that destroyed entire neighborhoods, as the Israeli army launched its Iron Swords military operation last week.

At dawn Oct. 7, the Hamas movement and other Palestinian factions in Gaza, launched Operation Al-Aqsa Flood in response to ‚Äúthe continuing attacks by Israeli forces and settlers against the Palestinian people, their property, and their sanctities, especially Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem.",,2612,"{'like_count': 2433, 'comment_count': 179, 'num_users': 56443}",Kish B,,2023-10-17 12:01:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/47586256_311470799481464_4811078951726219264_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nYL33v0hlycAX947ilD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC8ZJTSvlC2_yqD4jcfzsCDf2ROJvXBBEDXX6V8AJ5vGw&oe=655A65E2,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyf8qT8O3GH/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.36329-15/393181859_213259345107730_2342569658805777479_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=mE-2UATIlw0AX-W00Rx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBFrUQXf3sdcLx_5cPUPhO1NH9mciOIE1Ihn-IGsIDGCQ&oe=655962E6

instagram,"‚ÄúMany around the D.C. region are grieving after recent attacks on Israel by Hamas has led to days of violence in Israel and Gaza.

On Tuesday night, over 100 people gathered at Meridian Hill Park in Columbia Heights to publicly recite the Kaddish ‚Äì a Jewish prayer for the dead ‚Äî for both Israelis and Palestinians killed in the conflict. The event was organized by the group IfNotNow, a Jewish organization that says its mission is to organize ‚Äúfor equality, justice, and a thriving future for Palestinians and Israelis,‚Äù to create a space for local people to come together.

‚ÄúWe learn from Jewish tradition that we‚Äôre not meant to mourn alone,‚Äù says Rabbi Jenna Shaw, who led the prayer.

One of the core teachings of Judaism is b‚Äôtzelem Elohim ‚Äî meaning that every living human is created in the image of God ‚Äî says Shaw. That‚Äôs why they call for an end to the years of fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas militants, which has led to hundreds of civilian casualties.

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going to mourn for Israelis, we also have to mourn for Palestinians,‚Äù continues Shaw.

Shoshana Rosenbaum, who lives in D.C. with her husband and their two teenage boys, says she wanted to attend the prayer to mourn the loss of all lives.

‚ÄúI believe in the effort toward peace, even in the darkest days,‚Äù says Rosenbaum. ‚ÄúThere has to be an acknowledgment of the pain of both peoples in order to make any progress, so that‚Äôs why I wanted to be here.‚Äù‚Äù

instagram,"In Mike Flanagan‚Äôs The Fall of the House of Usher, color is a centerpiece‚Äînot unlike the works of Edgar Allan Poe that inspired the series. The show tells the story of the eponymous Usher family, led by patriarch Roderick (Bruce Greenwood) and his twin sister Madeline (Mary McDonnell), and their dynasty that is under threat.

Each episode of House of Usher is based on a Poe short story and ends with the death of a member of the family. And each death scene‚Äîelaborate and memorable‚Äîboasts a distinct color associated with the character in conflict.

instagram,"Last week I posted here reflecting on why the atrocities committed by Hammas on innocent Israeli men, women and children were similar to 9/11, arguing that the terrorists were seeking to provoke Israel into anger as a means of scuppering the relationships that Netanyahu had been building  between Isreal and Sunni Arab nations in the region. Today I want to talk about the ways that the Black Saturday attack was not like 9/11.

In September 2001, America was targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists as a proxy for western imperialism. The evidence is found in the ‚ÄòLetter to America‚Äô that Osama Bin Laden posted after the event to justify ordering such a horrific attack. That he included ‚Äòenvironmental destruction‚Äô in the list reasons why America deserved to be attacked was a sign that he was desperate to convince people that he was right to order such an atrocity.

Hammas felt no need to offer an explanation for why they attacked Israel, and it was not because no words could justify the terrible acts of violence that they committed that day. Israel is not a proxy target to Hammas. It is a state which has been in conflict with the Palestinian people for the past 70 years. Sometimes that war has been one of low level attrition, sometimes it has been all-out combat. The fact that Israel has been forced to become a highly militarised society is a product of this reality.

I stress again that this does not mean that the Hammas attacks were justified. Directly targeting civilians, in terror or war, cannot be justified. The point that I am seeking to make is that, horrific though it may be, Black Saturday didn‚Äôt just appear out of a blue sky like the planes that hit the Twin Towers. The world has watched this uneven conflict play out on our tv screens over the past decades. We have witnessed the cycle of terrorism and retribution over and over again. We know what is coming next. The humanity that causes us to weep for the victims of Black Saturday also makes us fear for the people of Gaza.

instagram,"üá∫üá∏ üáÆüá± üáµüá∏ U.S. President Biden to travel to Israel on Wednesday to discuss the war with officials. IDF will also reportedly, at that time, discuss plans for offensive actions and disclose how they plan to reduce civilian casualties from their strikes on Gaza.

Biden also warned Israel in an interview aired on Sunday not to reoccupy Gaza, while discussing the conflict. 

U.S Sec of State Blinken also announced that Biden will discuss with Netanyahu, as he has just done, a plan to allow aid into Gaza. This meeting also may possibly involve Egyptian officials regarding aid shipments and border crossings of that aid.

Biden has offered staunch support for Israel since the Oct. 7 attack and refused to criticize Israel for its retaliatory siege of Gaza, the coastal enclave controlled by ƒ§*m*·π£, even as U.N. officials have warned of a humanitarian crisis there. But in the new interview, he cautioned against a full-scale occupation of Gaza.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôd be a big mistake,‚Äù Mr. Biden told ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù on CBS in a conversation taped on Thursday and aired on Sunday night. ‚ÄúLook, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is ƒ§*m*·π£ and the extreme elements of ƒ§*m*·π£ don‚Äôt represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again.‚Äù But ‚Äútaking out the extremists‚Äù there, he added, ‚Äúis a necessary requirement.‚Äù

In the ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù interview, Mr. Biden did not explicitly say whether Israel should send ground forces into Gaza temporarily. But he endorsed the goal of destroying ƒ§*m*·π£, an organization whose founding covenant embraces ‚Äúkilling the Jews‚Äù and wiping out Israel.

instagram,"üá∫üá∏ üáÆüá± üáµüá∏ U.S. President Biden to travel to Israel on Wednesday to discuss the war with officials. IDF will also reportedly, at that time, discuss plans for offensive actions and disclose how they plan to reduce civilian casualties from their strikes on Gaza.

Biden also warned Israel in an interview aired on Sunday not to reoccupy Gaza, while discussing the conflict. 

U.S Sec of State Blinken also announced that Biden will discuss with Netanyahu, as he has just done, a plan to allow aid into Gaza. This meeting also may possibly involve Egyptian officials regarding aid shipments and border crossings of that aid.

Biden has offered staunch support for Israel since the Oct. 7 attack and refused to criticize Israel for its retaliatory siege of Gaza, the coastal enclave controlled by ƒ§*m*·π£, even as U.N. officials have warned of a humanitarian crisis there. But in the new interview, he cautioned against a full-scale occupation of Gaza.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôd be a big mistake,‚Äù Mr. Biden told ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù on CBS in a conversation taped on Thursday and aired on Sunday night. ‚ÄúLook, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is ƒ§*m*·π£ and the extreme elements of ƒ§*m*·π£ don‚Äôt represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again.‚Äù But ‚Äútaking out the extremists‚Äù there, he added, ‚Äúis a necessary requirement.‚Äù

In the ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù interview, Mr. Biden did not explicitly say whether Israel should send ground forces into Gaza temporarily. But he endorsed the goal of destroying ƒ§*m*·π£, an organization whose founding covenant embraces ‚Äúkilling the Jews‚Äù and wiping out Israel. The United States and European Union have designated ƒ§*m*·π£ a terr@r!st group.

instagram,"Can you ever really lose yourself? These last few weeks have been really difficult for me. I landed up at a terrible retreat centre, which threw me into severe malnutrition and totally dulled my energy. More on cautions with new age spirituality which is disconnected from the real traditions very soon. It‚Äôs been astrologically heavy, we have world conflict, I always aim to show up and serve my best but the events of the past few weeks - for the first time in my whole adult life, have made me feel like maybe I lost myself. 

It took some time, but my energy started to get better. My memory started coming  back, yet when you go through something destructive - it takes time to heal. And there are times in life where you really feel like, you lost your spirit. And nothing can feel worse. 

Comfortably numb - as Pink Floyd said. 

But amidst all the duality, there are lessons and a shedding of the old. A shedding of the paradigms we once related to. The acknowledge of what doesn‚Äôt suit our spirit and soul, and the spaces where we feel most at home. 

That, despite how much something or an experience brings you down, there is always and ALWAYS simultaneously a much higher good being birthed too. There is always light, and eternal light of the heart, the beautiful connection with life, nature, our dharma and deities. 

Intrinsically, you can never lose yourself. People may come and go but you can never lose what‚Äôs real. So no matter how much reality seems to be warping - the words, ‚Äòthere‚Äôs no such thing as a bad trip‚Äô truly make sense. 

Moving through the karmic cycles, surrendering trust in our divine origin and opening, opening even further to embrace the overwhelming love of the universe that we call life.

Antifascist Demonstration I Saturday, 21.10. I 16.00 I Christian Broda Platz

For years, the same sad spectacle repeats itself in regular intervals: as soon as the so-called ""Middle East conflict"" escalates, so does antisemitism on the streets of Vienna. Led by associations whose sole purpose is to wipe out the only Jewish state, an alliance of ""left-wing"" anti-imperialists, Islamist fundamentalists, neo-Nazis and Turkish right-wing extremists is formed, who see that an opportune moment has come to finally deal the death blow to the hated ""Zionist entity"". The anti-zionist agitation against Israel is not just a criticism of the state and the nation. Quite the contrary. Not coincidentally, does it project all the atrocities of modern statehood only on the one single Jewish state, which serves as an anti-semitic object of projection to distinguish good from evil rule, instead of wanting to abolish all oppression.

Those who claim ""Palestine solidarity"" are not concerned with the liberation of Palestinian civilians from the conditions in which humans are degraded, enslaved and abandoned. Rather, they replicate this bondage in the name of ""national liberation"" or trivialize Islamist terror as anti-colonial resistance. The supposed commitment against the suffering and for the rights of the Palestinians is only put forward as long as it can be used as an accusation against Israel. And thus, in these circles, people like to keep silent about the inhumane practices of Hamas or the Palestinian Authority against their own population. Silence is kept about the suffering of those who are held in tent cities for generations as refugees without rights and as bargaining chips against Israel. Silence is kept about the other Nakba, the expulsion of 450,000 Palestinians from Kuwait in 1991, in revenge for the PLO's commitment to the mass murderer Saddam Hussein. Silence is kept about the situation of the Palestinians in Jordan or Lebanon, /1",,1770,"{'like_count': 1617, 'comment_count': 153, 'num_users': 26540}",autonome antifa [w],,2023-10-17 15:45:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/353619119_261907866434941_3570359961072475357_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=aLD7qqFWLJYAX8fhsda&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBUZvlfirEmmvuV_JuxUm8-Ho-yc9ikGtBQfzeKoh4D9w&oe=655AE9C1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CygWQoTosAD/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393069567_706382438023727_145273927961425521_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=y0Ep8y8HWlkAX-hUaNv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB6WtcaCLeSWIC54ITXQ1qSn8JV3aYx_vDWyylkHqQfWg&oe=6551C9BF

On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel's bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ali hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world's most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb.

Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

""As scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

This is a picture of my children and a picture of another woman‚Äôs children. 

The last few days have been full of turmoil for me. The images I have seen circulated have given me the most vivid nightmares. I have consistently woken up panicked and sweating having seen my own children coming to the same fate as those involved in the war. It is so indescribably painful. We live our lives cushioned and comforted by the roof above our head the food we eat and the stability a life without conflict gifts us. I visited the region in my twenties and understand the complexity of the politics. 
My heart bleeds for all those suffering, a pain that is beyond the pain that I can even begin to conceive.  I keep asking myself ‚ÄòWhat if?‚Äô What if that child was mine, what if I was living a life where there was no guarantee of tomorrow?

instagram,"Today Pope Francis has called for a worldwide day of prayer and fasting for peace. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúI invite all believers to unite with the Church in the Holy Land, dedicating themselves today to prayer and fasting for peace, so that the hostages be freed, civilians not be made victims of the conflict, humanitarian law be respected, and innocent blood not be shed.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
Prayer for Peace‚Å†
‚Å†
Lord God of peace, hear our prayer!‚Å†
We have tried so many times and over so many years to resolve our conflicts by our own powers and by the force of our arms. How many moments of hostility and darkness have we experienced; how much blood has been shed; how many lives have been shattered; how many hopes have been buried‚Ä¶ But our efforts have been in vain.‚Å†
‚Å†
Now, Lord, come to our aid! Grant us peace, teach us peace; guide our steps in the way of peace. Open our eyes and our hearts, and give us the courage to say: ""Never again war!""; ""With war everything is lost"". Instill in our hearts the courage to take concrete steps to achieve peace.‚Å†
‚Å†
Lord, God of Abraham, God of the Prophets, God of Love, you created us and you call us to live as brothers and sisters. Give us the strength daily to be instruments of peace; enable us to see everyone who crosses our path as our brother or sister. Make us sensitive to the plea of our citizens who entreat us to turn our weapons of war into implements of peace, our trepidation into confident trust, and our quarreling into forgiveness.‚Å†
‚Å†
Keep alive within us the flame of hope, so that with patience and perseverance we may opt for dialogue and reconciliation. In this way may peace triumph at last, and may the words ""division"", ""hatred"" and ""war"" be banished from the heart of every man and woman. Lord, defuse the violence of our tongues and our hands. Renew our hearts and minds, so that the word which always brings us together will be ""brother"", and our way of life will always be that of: Shalom, Peace, Salaam!‚Å†

It goes something like ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok now, they‚Äôre more than enough to make up for my flaws. If I do a good job as a mum I‚Äôll finally be enough. I‚Äôll finally have done enough‚Äù

But actually the way we feel about and talk about and treat ourselves, forms the basis for how we love other people. Including our children. 

Even if the two things seem separate, sooner or later the parts of yourself that you don‚Äôt own, don‚Äôt love, wish didn‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶will spill over. 

Either directly towards your children in those moments when exhaustion meets overwhelm and a lack of self compassion. Or if not, it‚Äôll be directed towards your partner (which they will see and internalise), or towards other people in your life.

Your relationship with yourself dictates the quality of your relationships with everyone else.

instagram,"In a speech delivered before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan expressed deep regret over the failure of the international community to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh by Azerbaijan. Pashinyan's speech shed light on the dire situation in the region, stating that over 100,000 Armenians were forced to flee their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh within a single week, amidst the inaction of Russian peacekeepers and the indifference of global powers.
Pashinyan lamented the lack of effective action despite numerous warnings, international rulings, and resolutions passed by bodies such as the International Court of Justice, the European Parliament, and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. He highlighted the blatant disregard for these warnings, resulting in the mass exodus of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh. The Prime Minister emphasized that Azerbaijan's intentions to make life impossible for Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh were crystal clear, leading to the tragic displacement of thousands of families.
Armenia's leader criticized the international community's surprise at the depopulation of Nagorno-Karabakh in September, asserting that his country had consistently warned about Azerbaijan‚Äôs intentions since December 2022. He expressed his disappointment at the lack of support from Armenia's security allies during the crisis, revealing that instead of assistance, calls for a coup against his democratically elected government were made. Pashinyan condemned these actions as attacks on Armenia‚Äôs sovereignty and democracy, orchestrated through foreign aggression and hybrid technologies.
The Armenian Prime Minister thanked the European Parliament for acknowledging the dire situation faced by the forcibly displaced Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. He called for future efforts to protect the rights of these individuals and ensure their safety, despite the challenges posed by the ongoing conflict.",,1493,"{'like_count': 1356, 'comment_count': 137, 'num_users': 53210}",THE ARMENIAN REPORT,,2023-10-17 15:59:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/324592287_188950260390020_6056012698243655574_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EqMHXAcy72sAX-IXX8f&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA-muakr8pzJjpJFFjhvYTWanWCIog8dIcHLAUsnT7Qwg&oe=655A868E,https://www.instagram.com/p/CygX4J8KsUd/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392742650_994740268422240_1756993875722111198_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=GVRDnFpSnTcAX-fLxCh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfACoMEI7a4h5yphazKcUstxT4SQy4Cvc5BNgF6sSTMtlA&oe=654388A8
instagram,"Regardless of one's religious or cultural background, it is imperative as humans that we cannot turn a blind eye to the dire situation unfolding in Palestine. We cannot, and must not, stay silent; we must talk about it openly. This is not a 'complicated conflict,' nor is it a situation that necessitates excessive nuance. It's not a 'geopolitical event' that requires us to make vague condemnations of 'bad actors' on 'both sides.'

What we are witnessing is nothing short of a genocide. The Israeli state's actions against the Palestinian people are unequivocally a genocide, and it is occurring right before our eyes. There is no room for ambiguity; it is a genocide, carried out by the Israeli state against the Palestinian population. You don't need to read between the lines: Israel has openly, with little resistance from so-called liberal democracies, severed Gaza's access to essential resources such as water, food, and electricity. This has left more than two million Palestinians, including a million children, deprived of even the most basic necessities for life.

Consider this staggering fact: in just six days, Israel has dropped 6,000 bombs on the besieged coastal enclave, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, half of whom are innocent children. Israel's use of internationally banned white phosphorus, the heartbreaking deaths of babies as young as seven days old, and their orders for 1.1 million people to evacuate their homes within 24 hours, followed by bombings that injure and kill those attempting to flee, are all reprehensible acts.

What we are witnessing is nothing less than ethnic cleansing in full view of the world. We cannot, in good conscience, look away from these unspeakable horrors. It is our moral duty to discuss this crisis openly and take decisive action to bring it to an end. Humanity demands nothing less.

Furthermore, it is crucial to be aware that Instagram is actively restricting accounts that post about the situation in Palestine. Therefore, we urge you to share and talk about it as much as possible to ensure that the truth is not silenced. Via:¬†@theafghan

instagram,"Do you have a queer memory? You can immortalise it by dropping a pin on a digital map of the world via @queeringthemap ... but for the residents of war-torn Gaza, the platform has become a heartbreaking testament of their pain.

Queering the Map is a digital space that allows LGBTQ+ people to tag a place anywhere on the planet and writing anonymous messaging describing what a location means to them. So far, there are over half a million memories pinned all over the globe, affirming that queer history is everywhere.

With Gaza under bloody siege, recent memories of queer people caught in the conflict have emerged, and they are gut-wrenching.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always imagined you and me sitting in the sun, hand in hand, free at last,"" one message read, from Jabalia, a few kilometers north of Gaza city. ""We spoke of all the places we would go if we could. Yet you are gone now.""

‚ÄúIf I had known that bombs raining down on us would take you from me, I would have gladly told the world how I adored you more than anything. I‚Äôm sorry I was a coward.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how long I will live so just want this to be my memory here before I die,"" another from North Gaza, which is currently being evacuated, read. ""I am not going to leave my home, come what may. My biggest regret is not kissing this one guy. He died two days back. We had told each other how much we like each other and I was too shy to kiss last time. He died in the bombing. I think a big part of me died too. And soon I will be dead. To younus, I will kiss you in heaven.‚Äù

‚ÄúA place were I kissed my first crush,"" another yet reads. ""Being gay in Gaza is hard but somehow it was fun. I made out with a lot of boys in my neighborhood thought everyone is gay to some level.‚Äù

The platform has also attracted a flooding of support from other nations and religions, with one self-described ""gay Jew"" leaving a simple message of ""Free Palestine"" pinned in the heart of the conflict zone.

The website has sadly also been subject to cyberattacks, and has been down for several weeks according to Twitter/X users. Still, these messages remind us that civilians should never (but often are) caught in the crossfires of war.",,1427,"{'like_count': 1376, 'comment_count': 51, 'num_users': 179230}",Lovin Malta,,2023-10-17 18:30:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/382940755_1181681996122251_884547678922196631_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=j9dNjtCX9NsAX_butpK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCpDkLl2y9XkLL6O0KUKVuH514sQq8sSXvf3QAbaZHmxg&oe=655B7A38,https://www.instagram.com/p/CygpGyfv8UI/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/393398506_718181130350408_7936239844528328716_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=da-AJTUg4xsAX8VoaQK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC_gDpyfDsWykqxosdN8OO4bChlknoqEtO5dCVQnjk1VQ&oe=653EBCA2
instagram,"A gruesome video of a man beheading a child went viral on social media last week ‚Äî initially shared by a premium or verified Twitter account as evidence of Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel. The video was viewed by millions online, and shared with hashtags ‚ÄòIslamIsTheProblem‚Äô and ‚ÄòIsraelUnderAttack‚Äô.

But was it a video of the escalated Israel-Palestine conflict? Fact-checkers found that the clip was unrelated to Israel or Palestinian militant group Hamas, and was instead shot in Syria in 2016. The false claims were quickly debunked by fact-checkers using multiple technological tools ‚Äî but the damage had already been done.

Credible information has been collateral damage in the Israel-Palestine conflict, in which at least 2,670 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed so far. 

Within days of the escalation that began on October 8, fact-checkers reported being faced with a huge volume of misinformation and disinformation. 

The fact-checkers who spoke to Newslaundry called the barrage of misinformation ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù with many pointing to the role of X, formerly known as Twitter, in fuelling it.

I come from a country where the words ‚Äúceasefire‚Äù, ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù and ‚Äúpeace process‚Äù were as much a part of my childhood as words like ‚Äúcartoon‚Äù and ‚Äúplayground‚Äù. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have thoughts. 

It‚Äôs that I‚Äôm keenly aware of how easy it is to misspeak. To be misinformed. To contribute to the spread of a harmful and false narrative. 

I lived for 26 years immersed in a situation with some significant parallels to the current conflict‚Ä¶and I managed to misunderstand it completely. Only now do I realise that I failed to grasp important nuances. 

Trust me when I say that most of us should probably close our mouths. We might regret our vocal support of causes we don‚Äôt fully comprehend. I know that‚Äôs my experience in the N. Ireland conflict. 

Worth also saying you can silently be active. Today I supported @humanite.peace.collective . I‚Äôm never going to regret trying to provide shelter, food and water to non-combatants.

instagram,"Scoop: The White House has been discussing the possibility of using military force if Hezbollah joins the war in Gaza and attacks Israel with its huge arsenal of rockets, three U.S. officials and one Israeli official with knowledge of the situation tell Axios.

Why it matters: Lebanon-based Hezbollah joining the war would dramatically escalate the Middle East's worst conflict in decades ‚Äî raising the likelihood of mass civilian casualties in Israel and Lebanon and possibly drawing in the U.S.

‚Ä¢ The Israeli military ‚Äî now focused mostly on Gaza ‚Äî would have a significantly more difficult time fighting on two fronts simultaneously while missiles rain down on its bases and Israel's population centers.

State of play: Since the Gaza war began Oct. 7, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been increasing, with daily skirmishes between the parties along the Israel-Lebanon border.

‚Ä¢ Iran-backed Hezbollah has fired rockets and anti-tank missiles at Israeli outposts and forces on the border in recent days, while Israeli airstrikes have hit Hezbollah positions. Several Hezbollah operatives and several IDF soldiers have been killed.

‚Ä¢ At the same time, both sides have managed to keep the exchange of fire on a relatively low level, avoiding all-out fighting.

‚Ä¢ Hezbollah so far has refrained from sending its operatives for a ground assault or from firing its long-range, accurate missiles at Israeli targets.

instagram,"Visual Riff: Expressions of Grief

These posts were prepared before the recent Hamas terror rampage into Israel and the resulting ferocious Israeli attacks on Gaza. I've seen this film way too many times, but this episode has taken the hostilities to another level. 

Since I first started photographic reporting in Palestine and Israel in 1992, I've watched as both sides have become more coarse, hateful, and dehumanizing towards each other. When I began my project on messianic Jewish Settlers in the West Bank in 1994, I was told how Palestinian families in nearby villages would bring their newborn sons to the rabbi in the adjacent settlement to get circumcised. That sort of cooperation and coexistence would be unthinkable now.

We need an end to war, violence, and the other atrocities we've witnessed over the past days. I'm holding my breath that Israel finds the strength and humanity to resist the complete destruction of northern Gaza. Exacting retribution will only continue this cycle of violence.

instagram,"The Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) will cease to exist next year. The mountainous region in the South Caucasus, with a majority of the Armenian population, has been a focal point of ethnic conflicts and intermittent wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan for over three decades. 

Armenia and Azerbaijan were former members of the Soviet Union. In the late 1980s, the ethnic Armenians in the Karabakh region of Azerbaijan initiated a demand to be governed by Armenia; however, it was rejected by both Azerbaijan and Soviet Union. Authored by Swati Kakarwad for the Geostrata.

Global Appeal: End the Tragic Loss of Innocent Palestinian Lives

Dear World,

We urgently call for an immediate halt to the heartbreaking loss of innocent Palestinian children's lives. The time has come to put an end to this cycle of violence and devastation.

Enough is enough.

Innocent lives are being lost, and it is our collective responsibility to act. We implore the international community to unite and take a stand against these senseless killings. Every child's life is precious and deserving of protection, regardless of their nationality or background.

The ongoing violence in Palestine demands our immediate attention. We cannot remain silent as families suffer, communities crumble, and hope fades away. We must come together and demand an end to this tragedy.

Peace is not achieved through violence but through dialogue, empathy, and understanding. We urge all parties involved to exercise restraint, engage in meaningful negotiations, and find a peaceful resolution to this long-standing conflict. The lives of innocent children hang in the balance.

To the people of Israel, we plead with you to recognize the sanctity of children's lives and work towards reconciliation. Let us build a future where both nations can coexist peacefully, free from violence and fear.

To world leaders and decision-makers, we urge you to use your influence and diplomatic channels to mediate a just and lasting resolution. The international community must unite and take decisive action to protect the lives of innocent children.

Let us remember that our shared humanity far outweighs any differences. The pain of a grieving Palestinian or Israeli family is universal. Together, we can make a difference. Stand in solidarity with the innocent children of Palestine and send a powerful message that their lives matter.

Now is the time for peace, justice, and compassion.

instagram,"While the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens, and Israel prepares to launch an all-out ground incursion into the Gaza Strip following Hamas' staged surprise attacks that killed over 1,400 people in Israel on October 7th, the risk that the conflict widens to other parts of the region, grows by the day.

As a precaution, the Israeli military started to deploy tens of thousands of additional troops near the border with Lebanon. Israel also started evacuating 28 Israeli communities near the northern border with Lebanon because of escalating hostilities with Hezbollah militants. 

And Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian stating on Iran's state TV last night, that a ""preemptive action"" could be expected in the coming hours, further fuels the fear that the conflict will expand to other parts of the region.  Such a preemptive action as referred to by Iran's top envoy, will most likely include attacks carried out by Iran's Lebanon-based proxy Hezbollah.

Hezbollah is Lebanon's most powerful military force and has long-range rockets at its disposal that could strike deep into Israeli territory. It fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006 that left Israel's public opinion demoralized. Analysts note that the Israeli military‚Äôs impending ground invasion of Gaza could push Hezbollah to launch a major attack on Israel, which would come at a tremendous human cost given that the group possesses greater military capabilities than Hamas. But how far Hezbollah will go remains unclear. 

As a major player in this conflict (weather it decides to join the Israel - Hamas War, or not), this is what you need to know about Hezbollah, considered by many experts to be the world's most heavily armed and experienced non-state fighting force.",,1200,"{'like_count': 1188, 'comment_count': 12, 'num_users': 89733}",Military Engineering & Technology,,2023-10-17 00:07:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/106792740_622450195032535_5640660217098662249_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0dw5J0oDtw8AX-XXFii&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCbDHzt4_KJ7W2mJUrft61hSIkMdEDkX13ehm2npfz2mA&oe=655A65B5,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyeq8eRI1HF/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/358174309_774574867691477_2190925640854480836_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Ddh70C416SAAX_uiFcA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDZutlfRl_nMXzun59AnLETws6_4WtA-V1nEdNkTpoOJA&oe=655A3244

instagram,"Images by Tomas van Houtryve @tomasvh // Photography does not automatically lend itself to narrative. Building a story arc with individual pictures requires a sense of time, place, character, and causality. This is a photo essay that I did in 2005 for the New York Times Magazine about a road being built in impoverished rural Nepal by Maoist guerrillas using conscripted labour. In this case, I used black-and-white film and a classic linear story arc. The images attempt to distill a complex series of events during a long-running conflict into a tight narrative. I will be discussing the relationship between photography and narrative at my upcoming workshop at @domainecazenac in #Dordogne, France in mid-November.

instagram,"Israeli law enforcement authorities have ordered a freeze on hundreds of cryptocurrency accounts and seized millions of dollars' worth of crypto in order to block the flow of funds to Hamas, Financial Times reported. 

The crackdown primarily targets cryptocurrency accounts on Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Since the onset of Hamas's assault on October 7, more than 100 accounts on Binance have been closed, and authorities have sought information on approximately 200 additional crypto accounts, the majority of which are held on Binance.

Tom Alexandrovich, the executive director at the Israel National Cyber Directorate, emphasized on the increasing significance of cryptocurrencies in financing terror during wartime. 

The amount of crypto funds involved has surged significantly since the conflict began earlier this month.

instagram,"'Go to Gaza': Himanta Biswa Sarma slams Asaduddin Owaisi in response to comments on Israel-Palestine war

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has criticized All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi for his comments regarding Israel and the recent Hamas attack

The Assam CM's response came after a reporter asked him about Owaisi's statements supporting Gaza during a visit to Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi, where he also performed the Rudrabhishek at the Vishwanath temple.

Owaisi, speaking during a public rally, claimed that nearly ten lakh people had become homeless and forcibly displaced due to the conflict. He also referred to Israel as an occupier of Palestinian territory. He criticized the global community for remaining silent on the atrocities and media's one-sided reporting.

Himanta Biswa Sarma countered Owaisi's stance, suggesting that Owaisi should travel to Gaza immediately to fight for the rights of the Palestinian people against Israel. The Assam Chief Minister remarked that Owaisi should not merely voice support in Hyderabad by chanting ""Palestine Zindabad."" Instead, he should assume a more significant role by directly advocating for Hamas in Gaza.

Sarma declared Hamas a terrorist organization and argued that those supporting the group are also terrorists. He emphasized the need for strict action against individuals who endorse Hamas, stating that their actions support terrorism. He concluded by affirming India's policy of condemning terrorism, emphasizing the nation's own history of being a victim of terrorism.

This exchange between Himanta Biswa Sarma and Asaduddin Owaisi reflects a broader discussion of international affairs and geopolitical issues, particularly concerning the Israel-Palestine conflict.",,1099,"{'like_count': 1050, 'comment_count': 49, 'num_users': 61502}",The Express News Hyderabad,,2023-10-17 13:10:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/299654400_734560460972759_7642973483431267142_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qkVqSvILvDIAX99iHcb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAsEK4QpGddcFt7Ey_C8qWUtua_5Dyc72Cc_ZbwqmijYg&oe=655AA49F,https://www.instagram.com/p/CygEiikrioa/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.36329-15/391469432_345467958041782_1936044081160524801_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=_b_ddSsaSFwAX9u0cxj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBcOf8fKvBzZxSNHZZBkn-kB4y1f3s00kMF39oO_h7uMQ&oe=65457648

An explosion occurred at the Baptist Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday evening, resulting in reports of hundreds of casualties, as stated by the Gaza Health Ministry, which is under Hamas control. The Health Ministry has accused Israel of targeting the hospital.

As of now, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not issued a statement regarding the incident. It‚Äôs worth noting that the explosion was reported concurrently with a significant barrage of rockets being launched from Gaza towards central Israel.

In previous conflicts, rockets fired by Hamas and other Palestinian factions have occasionally fallen short of their intended targets, striking buildings in Gaza.

Doctors, nurses and patients at the Anglican hospital, a Christian hospital in Gaza City were all killed by the IDF.  I'm hearing that the death toll from this bomb is closer to 1000.

Shame on @potus @vp @secblinken for providing the weapons to Israel the country responsible for this atrocity.

This is a war crime! 

This is surely going to anger the surrounding nations and drag America into another global conflict. This doesn't make anyone safer.

On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel‚Äôs bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.‚Äù

instagram,"Opinion | Anti-Arab and Islamaphobic rhetoric has become more prevalent around campus, and Penn‚Äôs community and administration must stand against it.‚Å†
‚Å†
Since the Palestine Writes Literature Festival and vandalism of Hillel took place last month, Penn students have been increasingly engaged in discourse regarding Palestine and Israel. Discourse surrounding a political topic as polarizing as Israel and Palestine is ‚Äî or at least should be ‚Äî welcomed in a university, especially one that offers courses dedicated to the region and to the conflict itself. This discourse, however, should never come at the expense of the safety of Jewish, Muslim, and Arab individuals.‚Å†
‚Å†
I am not here to say that the Jewish community is not oppressed. I am not here to say that the Jewish community is not allowed to grieve. That would be obscenely ignorant and antisemitic. The Jewish community deserved more protection after the vandalism of Hillel, and they deserved a near-immediate response from Magill regarding the vandalism of a cultural religious center on campus. At the same time, I cannot help but find it appalling that the president of the University can issue a statement in which the Arab victims are never mentioned and Palestinians are only allowed to exist within the context of a controversial festival.‚Å†

instagram,"Babes. This is why I‚Äôm so damn obsessed with ya‚Äôll becoming relational mastery badasses. 

It‚Äôs simple. 

The relationships you choose set the tone for your entire LIFE. 

An aligned relationship will have you waking up inspired, taking aligned action, moving and grooving in the direction of what makes your soul sing, taking care of your mind, body and spirit. Making money. Vibin high. Feeling fully. Overcoming challenges like a boss. It will nourish all parts of you. The passion, the spice, the electric aliveness of intimacy. The tenderness, the connection the sweetness of soul intimacy. 

It will be the safe place for you to land, but it will also light a fire under your ass so you continue growing, evolving and stepping into your brilliance. 

In other words it will add to your life not take you out of it. 

Alignment is a core nutrient we NEED in order to thrive in any area. Relationships are no different. 

When core alignment is at the foundation there is nothing you can‚Äôt navigate together but also in your own life. 

Also let‚Äôs drop the nonsense belief that aligned relationships never have conflict or it‚Äôs some sparkle-fest-everything is perfect-24/7-fairytale. Lols. No. 

Alignment means there is a mutual commitment to navigating conflict relationally, in a way that actually deepens intimacy, keeps those passion fires lit and strengthens the bond. 

This takes a solid amount of self and relational awareness to do. It also requires specific skill sets and ways of being. 

It means you have to be hella selective right from the start so you can set yourself up to win in love (which means winning in life too). 

It means you have to consciously create your relationship from the start and be committed to re-creating your relationship again and again to avoid stagnation and energetic flatlining. 

This Sunday I‚Äôm teaching a workshop on this exact topic. Love By Design- How to consciously create the love you desire.

instagram,"A former security guard who served during Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has returned to Israel to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reserves amid the conflict with Hamas. Israeli journalist Eran Swisa shared the news, commending the guard for leaving his American life to defend his homeland.

Could not remain indifferent to violence

Born in an Israeli Kibbutz, the guard stated that he couldn't remain indifferent to the violence against Jewish families. He strongly condemned Hamas, emphasizing the protection of civilians by one side and accusing the other of using them as human shields.

The guard's hiring details, whether directly by Swift or the tour's venue, remain undisclosed. Swift, currently on her Eras Tour, faces questions about her former guard's decision as she approaches the international leg of her tour. The Independent has sought comment from Swift's representative.

What the guard said
In an interaction with Variety, the guard said, ‚ÄúI got a pretty great life back in the US,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI got an amazing dream job that I love, great friends that I call family and a very comfortable home. I didn‚Äôt HAVE to come here‚Ä¶ But I could not stand on the sidelines while families are being slaughtered and burned alive in their homes!!! Just for being Jewish or for being Israelis.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile one side is protecting babies, kids and the elderly, the other side is using those as human shields!!! It‚Äôll be an insult to animals worldwide to call them ‚Äòanimals‚Äô but those are not human beings,‚Äù the guard as quoted as saying of Hamas.
""Families were killed alongside their pets in their beds, and their houses were burned down! Imagine such horrors in your own neighborhood or happening to someone you know.""

It remains unclear if the individual was directly employed by Swift or by the tour venue.

After six months of conflict in Sudan, the human consequences are there for all to see.

Hana experienced this first-hand as a South Sudanese refugee who lost both her babies due to health complications when she was forced to flee again because of the conflict.

In Sudan's White Nile state, 1,200 refugee children under the age of 5 tragically died due to a deadly combination of a measles outbreak and severe malnutrition. New arrivals in South Sudan are also affected. UNHCR and partners are scaling up their response to address the deteriorating health situation, but more support is urgently needed.

instagram,"I‚Äôm not a historian. I barely even read historical fiction. But I am a writer, and I‚Äôm still struggling to find any words to speak coherently about the horror that‚Äôs going on in the Middle East. I don‚Äôt really understand the complex history and I don‚Äôt want to say something that will make anyone suffering right now feel worse.

But not saying anything feels like a worse option than saying the wrong thing. My heart breaks for all the suffering on both sides of the conflict. My heart breaks for all the innocent lives lost, including children. My heart breaks for the violence that‚Äôs spilled over into the U.S. and anywhere else it‚Äôs flowing. I don‚Äôt understand how the reaction to terrorist violence is to ramp up antisemitic incidents here (after 2022 already saw the highest rate of recorded antisemitic incidents in the U.S.). That should terrify us as a nation. I don‚Äôt understand how a landlord in Illinois, the state where I live, could have stabbed and killed a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy because of the conflict. That should also terrify us as a nation. I don‚Äôt understand why as a country we‚Äôre finding more and more ways to hate.

This is a flatlay of books by Jewish authors. It‚Äôs a small gesture to say that I stand with the Jewish community against hate and with my Jewish friends. It doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt also stand with the innocent Palestinians, because I do. I wish we could find a way to react to this horror with compassion and care for the victims and people affected instead of lashing out at them because of their religion or nationality and making everything so much worse. Not only do we as a people not seem to be learning anything from history‚Äîwhich maybe isn‚Äôt as surprising as it should be since we‚Äôre censoring our history books‚Äîbut we seem to be losing our humanity.

I realized when gathering books for this, that I don‚Äôt know if I have any books by Palestinian authors. Do you have a favorite to recommend or a favorite book by a Jewish author I should add to my list?",,911,"{'like_count': 811, 'comment_count': 100, 'num_users': 12444}",Mary Chase,,2023-10-17 21:58:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/60327299_880959635578532_8434512232502525952_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=xG-RW64O7RMAX_STV32&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA6M94NiLDI9az5WmQv0BP2uLoTP4i4HHOaHrYZWA_dRA&oe=655B76C9,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyhA-1sraGR/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392959812_833068738459554_8060330611156477235_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qPwkGZILnpQAX9aFYla&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBpPge9-x376_sXwNh-FD4XxqPP4bpOo9X-VNTpbSXpGw&oe=654908DF

instagram,"Legacies are always a huge burden to carry. Those left behind get crushed under its weight. Smita ""Smi"" Patil left us with crushed by the weight of her memories, overwhelmed by her standout performances and a feeling of  an unbearable ache. 
The same ache returns when you see her character of Kavita Sanyal begging Pooja(Shabana Azmi) to leave Inder(Kulbushan) in that heart-breaking scene in #Arth. Kavita Sanyal's descent into hell was a close glimpse into relationships in showbiz as much as an understanding of a fractured mind.
The adaptation of Hansa Wadkar‚Äôs life was again as much an exploration of the whimsical ways of showbiz as much as it was a voyage into a woman's troubled journey. Barely 22 years of age, her portrayal mirrored the acute insecurities of women taking a stance without being unnecessary judgemental.
Empowerment was Smi's thing. She was affected by the world she inhabited. You see that concern In Sulabha Mahajan in Jabbar Patel's Umbartha. Sulabha‚Äôs need for self expression makes her leave the comfort of home and take up a job as warden in a rehabilitation home for women. This film could have been Smi's alter-ego speaking. 
Her role as Najma in Sagar Sarhadi's Bazaar also reflected that search for meaning.. It's only after her brother's fianc√©e commits suicide, she has a wake up call. Smi employed her eyes to dramatic effect and despite the somewhat awry Hyderabadi accent, her Najma in Bazaar is as solid as its heart-rending. 
Barely 29, how she entered the skin of 50 plus Hanumi in #Giddh is her triumph as a performer. You see that conflict in Rabindra Dharmaraj's Chakra. As Amma who tries to grapple a combative son and her various paramours, Smi's body language and sadness is compelling to watch.
Art for her indeed was a revelation of the truth. It was a quest. But as in the movies, the plot line changed.

instagram,"When you‚Äôre at odds with your kid, do things tend to escalate?

When it comes to diffusing conflicts with kids, using the right phrases can make a big difference. 

Remember, the goal is not just to resolve the immediate conflict, but also to teach children important skills like empathy, problem-solving, and effective communication.

Using phrases like these can help create an environment where conflicts are seen as opportunities for growth and learning rather than sources of frustration or anger.

Please note: It is important to tailor your approach based on each child's age, temperament, and individual needs.

But here are some helpful phrases that you can use to de-escalate tense situations and promote open communication! 

Phrases that keep the lines of communication open generally:
üëâüèΩ Validate the other person‚Äôs emotions
üëâüèΩ Acknowledge steps in the right direction
üëâüèΩ Show accountability for your part in the conflict
üëâüèΩ Demonstrate that you‚Äôre listening and you care
üëâüèΩ Seek to clear up misunderstandings
üëâüèΩ Avoid placing blame

Most are concerned about the whereabouts and wellbeing of family members, but continue to cling to hope that they are safe.

An Israeli blockade and complete blackout imposed on the Gaza Strip, including bans on electricity, admission of food and fuel, has left Gazans unable to communicate with their family members abroad.

War crimes are war crimes, regardless of who is the perpetrator and who is the victim.

The EU and its member states must call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to violence and adherence to international law. Humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza must continue and humanitarian corridors must be opened. We call on the EU and its member states to activate the temporary protection directive for refugees from Gaza, while ensuring Palestinians‚Äô right to return. 

Racism, antisemitism and islamophobia, are a scourge on our societies and must be stamped out. Our right to protest these and other injustices must be defended.

Some people wake up looking to ‚Äúfight.‚Äù To start drama or conflict. It‚Äôs often an unconscious behaviour with deeper roots. But it will do you no good engaging with that type of energy. You‚Äôll only deplete yourself feeding your energy to someone who feeds off your reactions. It empowers them. They get something from it. Hence the pattern you often see and why it‚Äôs a constant in their life. ‚Å£
‚Å£
But they don‚Äôt see that. Because it‚Äôs always everyone else. ‚Å£
‚Å£
So, stay grounded. Protect your own energy and don‚Äôt invest it into something that won‚Äôt give you a return or add any value to your day. To your life.‚Å£
‚Å£
If you want to experience happiness. Peace. Then be mindful not to willfully give away your greatest source of power. Your energy. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Å£

Thank you for all the comments on my last post.

I expected that there would be some negative comments against my decision. I am learning the history of the Tarot, which includes the historical facts such as the bible banned ‚Äúdivination‚Äù due to the reason they are demonic. Poland is a Catholic country, so I understand that some of you would feel unpleasant or tell me not to do that from your kindness.

However, I will keep going my way.

What I really want you to understand is that I don‚Äôt have any intensions to offend those who have made negative comments, nor to laugh at their beliefs. I do not need to offend or deny others in order to justify my belief. Denying others just leads to conflict. That‚Äôs not what I want.

Every person has the freedom of thought, belief and religion. So please keep what you believe in. That is the most important thing in life.

I suppose that some of you have experience like this. I mean, others oppose against you when you start something new with a positive motivation. Yeah, this often happens. You may be disappointed or sad in a such situation. But please do not give up your decision because of others‚Äô opinions.

You are free to follow your own path. You understand yourself, even though people don't understand you. And you are the only one who can take responsibility for your life.

Sending love to all of you üíì

People rally in support of Palestinians in front of the White House in Washington, DC on Monday. Israel warned of a long but ultimately victorious war against Hamas as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made his second visit within days to promise full support after a major attack. Israel is preparing a ground invasion of Hamas-ruled Gaza after the militants' October 7 attack and has been bombarding the blockaded territory for days, with civilians accounting for most victims on both sides.

instagram,"Official Statement on the Vote for Speaker of the House

This week, when members of the House of Representatives reconvene to vote for a speaker, they will have the opportunity to demonstrate their enduring commitment to our Constitutional system of government. While a handful of extremists have precipitated a crisis of leadership, an equally small number of courageous and reasonable actors have the opportunity to exhibit bipartisanship and restore faith in ethical governance. As leaders and members of Mormon Women for Ethical Government, we ask all members of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, to find a pathway to the election of a speaker who has proven they will support the peaceful transfer of power.

We are once again faced with a conflict within our governing bodies that would have previously seemed unthinkable. As citizens, we are asked to accept an impossible compromise ‚Äî tolerate congressional leaders who have worked to undermine a legitimate election, or risk having no functioning government at all. It is important for our elected representatives to see this compromise for what it is ‚Äî an extortionate lie.

Installing a speaker who previously voted against the certification of the 2020 election will compromise the security and stability of our nation. Those who worked to undermine the last election should not be trusted to oversee the next one. In the election for House leadership, it falls to members of the majority party to control their extreme factions. Key Republican members of the House must stand fast and work to elect a speaker who has demonstrated respect both for their colleagues and for legislative norms and processes. 

In addition, we earnestly plead with members of the Democratic caucus to work across the aisle with Republicans who are committed to upholding the rule of law. Any Democrat who votes to elect competent and ethical House leadership could reasonably claim to be a principled defender of good government, national security, fiscal responsibility, and respect for the individual citizens of this nation. These things must matter more than party politics.

instagram,"As home to both the largest Jewish and Muslim communities in Europe, France is feeling the strain of the Israel-Hamas war like no other country on the continent.

Tensions are embroiling everyone from school children to football players in a country with a complicated colonial history in the Middle East and North Africa, one that is suffering the unmistakable reverberations of a conflict that‚Äôs pitting Jews against their Muslim neighbors.

On Saturday the Louvre Museum and the Palace of Versailles, two of the capital‚Äôs top tourist destinations, were evacuated and shut down. Pro-Palestinian protests have been banned. The country‚Äôs been moved to the highest level of terror alert, with 7,000 soldiers deployed to supplement a heavy police presence on the streets. In the northern town of Arras, a teacher on Friday was fatally stabbed by a Muslim perpetrator.

A conflict playing out thousands of kilometers away has resonated in France, despite ‚Äî or perhaps because of ‚Äî the country‚Äôs long-standing secularism, which relegates the religious convictions of its citizens to the private sphere. Tap the link in bio for more.

instagram,"AMERICANS BEWARE: Government officials are warning of a rising threat of terror attacks in the United States since Hamas attacked Israel a week ago.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters it's possible that Hamas and other terror groups could call on their supporters to carry out attacks on U.S. soil. 

""The threat is very much ongoing and in fact, the threat picture continues to evolve,"" Wray said. ""Here in the U.S., we cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or other foreign terrorist organizations could exploit the conflict to call on their supporters to conduct attacks on our own soil.""

In a call with reporters, Wray warned there has been an increase in reported threats, and Jews and Muslims alike as well as their institutions and houses of worship have been threatened, CBS News reports.

He said the bureau is ""moving quickly to mitigate"" the threats adding that security officials are also on the lookout for ""lone actors"" who might commit violence on their own.

Terrorism experts have told CBN News Hamas and Hezbollah sleeper cells are operating within the United States.

And a comprehensive study by George Washington University last year found the most Hezbollah activity in Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and California. 

Former FBI Special Agent Eric Caron, now a security and counter-terrorism consultant to governments, told CBN News, ""We have over a thousand joint terrorism task force cases going on here in America today relating to Muslim extremists.""

This year, authorities have caught 151 people on the FBI's Terrorism Watch list trying to illegally enter the U.S. through the southern border, 50 times higher than two years ago. 

""The idea that they don't want to attack us again like a 9-11, but even bigger is foolish. They want to attack us. They want to destroy America,"" Caron said.",,575,"{'like_count': 521, 'comment_count': 54, 'num_users': 146241}",CBNNews,,2023-10-17 14:09:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/395025324_302897682516153_6510826915777999915_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=3BJnmpNSjQEAX_xM8k5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAJTn-CAYJ5ci7niSQI1JZmQWofSO4bzR09-o3diVP2_w&oe=655B3F9A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CygLPpnMYzs/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393236501_296041456708709_8768267003724782325_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AlBs_vYfMOkAX_wmbRQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB-vjcFXnaV90vrdJ2_M7dkyXflPnD60zwbO8iq4WQ-jA&oe=6546D6E9

He also called for the opening of aid channels to allow humanitarian deliveries to the Palestinian enclave, which has been sealed off ahead of an Israeli ground, sea and air offensive.

Support for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees is essential, he added, warning that Gaza requires immediate deliveries of aid.

The king urged the international community to condemn the targeting of civilians by Israel, adding that international law must be followed by every country.

The conflict in Gaza risks spilling over to the West Bank and the wider region, he warned, urging countries to reject collective punishment of Palestinians.

Forced displacement of Gazans could overwhelm neighboring countries, including Jordan and Egypt, he said.

He and Meloni also discussed the political horizon for a two-state solution, with Jordan and Italy ‚Äúmaintaining cooperation‚Äù in working for peace in Gaza.

Following the Hamas terror attack in Israel, Blinken visited numerous US allies in the Middle East last week, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in an effort to rally them around the US position. 
¬†
The trip's main purpose was to encourage the leaders to condemn Hamas' behavior. However, Blinken was reportedly met with hostility in Riyadh, where fundamental disagreements between the US and Saudis were revealed. 
¬†
Blinken had planned to meet Mohammed bin Salman in the evening after landing on Saturday, but was kept waiting for hours, according to the report, with the crown prince eventually showing up the next morning.

During the discussion, the crown prince reportedly demanded that Israel cease military operations ""that claimed the lives of innocent people.‚Äù He also allegedly called for the conflict to be de-escalated.

instagram,"This reflection focuses on the concept of God. Personally, I believe in an intelligent force that is the origin of everything in the universe, which I refer to as God. I perceive God as an energy of love and compassion, the essence of goodness and creation that resides within all living beings. 

This is why I don‚Äôt seek God in confined spaces or extravagant structures. The walls in such structures create physical and spiritual barriers between people and God. To truly experience God, one can connect by walking barefoot in nature, embracing a tree, pet, or another human being for three minutes. These actions can bring us closer to God, as God doesn‚Äôt require our admiration or worship, but rather wants us to embody his/her qualities and act accordingly.

During the distressing conflict between Israel and Palestine, I‚Äôve encountered videos from both sides claiming that God permits killing in his/her  name. I deeply question this notion. I firmly believe in one God. Do we possess different Gods? Is the Middle Eastern God distinct from the Western or East Asian God?

Instead of witnessing fights on my Instagram feed, let‚Äôs engage in discussions about God. Lately, we seem to have forgotten about God, as our hateful arguments render us Godless. 

So, my question is: where is God right now during this conflict? and what do you think God is contemplating when our self-centered minds assert that we are God‚Äôs most precious creation, made in his/her image? Yet, we behave as Godless beings. 

Please engage in a civilized and compassionate dialogue about this, devoid of hate. Perhaps by discussing God, we can remind ourselves that we came into this world to experience Godliness, not to harm and kill one another, as that aligns with the work of the Devil.

We need to connect with our Creator with love and respect let‚Äôs see how we do.

instagram,"Is conflict a major problem in your marriage? This week over in my free Facebook group (link in bio to join) I'll be going live to continue the conversation on conflict. Specifically what to do when defensiveness shows up in your marriage. What do you do instead of defending yourself? What do you do if your partner is defensive? 

I takes two people to create a conflict, but it only takes one person to end it. 

A lot gets said about the importance of defending yourself. But consider the difference between defending yourself and standing up for yourself. 

Defence is part of a game. It is a you vs. me tactic and it has no place in a healthy marriage. 

If I have to defend myself against you, that means you are just that, against me.

If you are against me in that moment, and I am now defending myself, we are not working towards anything positive for the relationship. We are not creating connection, we are creating disconnection. 

When you learn to truly not engage in creating that disconnection in your marriage, the spiral downward stops. 

It is likely the number one thing you can do to turn the tides on conflict.

instagram,"Coming back for its second season on Oct. 29 on HBO and Max is its critically acclaimed series The Gilded Age,¬†created and written by¬†Julian Fellowes.

Den√©e Benton, Audra McDonald, John Douglas Thompson return as Peggy, Dorothy and Arthur Scott respectively. Sullivan Jones was promoted to regular status for Season 2 as¬†T. Thomas Fortune¬†¬†

Among the creative team are writer/executive producer Sonja Warfield and executive producer Salli Richardson-Whitfield

Erica Armstrong Dunbar serves as a co-executive producer/ historical consultant on the series.

The American Gilded Age was a period of immense economic change, of great conflict between the old ways and brand new systems, and of huge fortunes made and lost. Season two of THE GILDED AGE begins on Easter morning 1883, with the news that Bertha Russell's bid for a box at the Academy of Music has been rejected. Through the eight episodes of the season, we watch as Bertha challenges Mrs. Astor and the old system and works to not only gain a foothold in Society, but to potentially take a leading role in it. George Russell takes on his own battle with a growing union at his steel plant in Pittsburgh. In the Brook House, Marian continues her journey to find her way in the world secretly teaching at a girls school while much to everyone‚Äôs surprise Ada begins a new courtship. Of course, Agnes approves of none of it. In Brooklyn, the Scott family begins to heal from a shocking discovery, and Peggy taps into her activist spirit through her work with T.

instagram,"What are you holding onto that‚Äôs setting you back?

The infantilization of our culture, coupled with the stamping out of any sense of a rite of passage, has engineered an almost unanimous stagnation among our young adults. 

There are common complaints of being unable to choose a life path, as if postponing their decision isn't a choice in itself.

Fundamentally, when you boil down the man who struggles with his own evolution, you are left with one thing.

An unresolved past.

A man who still identifies with the timid child shoved to the ground during a gym class.

A man whose heart remains shattered by the first woman who gave him attention.

A man who shies away from conflict, haunted by memories of his parents' contentious arguments.

These men may not consciously ruminate on these past pains, but they are fundamentally marked by them.

Preventing them from making decisions, fearing they could be put in harm's way again. 

Most men who navigate adulthood are stuck in these sands of their past.

Neurotically aware how a wrong choice could lead to catastrophe. 

Yet, they remain ignorant to the fact that their own inaction and ruminating is the very source of their suffering.

As the snake which cannot cast its skin is doomed to die.

The man who cannot evolve from his past, is doomed to regret it.

instagram,"Coexisting with wolves offers benefits far beyond just humans and wolves.

Coexistence = healthy ecosystems, biodiversity enhancement, natural population regulation, cultural enrichment, sustainable ecotourism opportunities, and ethical, long-term conflict resolution. An increasing body of scientific research shows us that lethal methods are often less effective than non-lethal solutions in reducing conflict and, in some cases, can actually increase conflict. üê∫üåé

Wolves, by nature, generally maintain a cautious distance from humans. Their inherent fear of people serves as a vital function in keeping wolves safe and subsequently reduces potential conflicts between wolves and people. There are rare instances when wolves may lose this fear, typically due to habituation or associating humans with a food source, which is an important reminder to keep wildlife wild.

Project Coyote advocates for collaboration among stakeholders with a shared objective of fostering coexistence between people, farm animals, and wildlife. Resources, such as our Ranching With Wildlife Program, now exist to educate and support ranchers and farmers in adopting evolving techniques that ensure animal safety through the utilization of predator-friendly management tools. While domestic animal losses are an unfortunate aspect of ranching, most stem from disease, adverse weather conditions, or birthing complications. The combination of sound animal husbandry practices and strategic non-lethal predator control methods can significantly reduce wildlife conflicts. üê∫üå±üêÑ

Maintaining a balance between the needs of wolf populations and human communities is crucial for successful coexistence. The key lies in the management of human-wolf conflicts through education and responsible practices. #WolfAwarenessWeek

instagram,"BOGOTA, Colombia
A day after Colombian President Gustavo Petro threatened to suspend relations with Israel due to their decision to halt security material exports to Colombia in response to his Middle East crisis stance, Foreign Minister Alvaro Leyva asked Israeli Ambassador Gali Dagan to ""apologize and leave"".

Using his X account, Leyva demanded respect for the president and accused Dagan of being ""rude.""
‚ÄúThe history of universal diplomacy will record as a milestone the senseless rudeness of Israel's ambassador in Colombia towards President Gustavo,‚Äù Leyva published on X. ‚ÄúShame on him. He should at least apologize and leave. Intelligence is confronted with intelligence. There are States at stake.‚Äù

This statement from Leyva intensifies an already elevated state of diplomatic tension between Colombia and Israel.
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously summoned Colombia's ambassador and reprimanded her for ""hostile and anti-Semitic"" comments by President Petro, who has refused to condemn the recent attack by Hamas on Israel, despite pleas from the Israeli government and the United States to do so.

Dagan has been responding to Petro's posts since the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Petro declared his refusal to ‚Äúsupport genocides‚Äù and pledged humanitarian aid to Gaza, where thousands have lost their lives in retaliatory airstrikes by Israel.
Israel confirmed the decision to stop sending arms ammunition to Colombia even though a good part of the weapons used by the Colombian Armed Forces including rifles, Kfir planes, anti-aircraft batteries, tanks and radars, drones, Spike type missiles used in harpy helicopters, armored vehicles, ammunition, mortars and maritime systems, come from Israel.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

instagram,"Which one are you? ü§´ Perhaps you know what it‚Äôs like to be taken advantage of, or to have your #kindness seen as an invitation for future exploitation.

It‚Äôs not your fault‚ùï

You were simply unable to manage your need to be liked, which is embedded as deeply in your software as your need for food and water.

Another cause might be your¬†personality.
Some of us rank high on¬†‚ÄòAGREEABLENESS‚Äô,¬†which means¬†you hate and avoid #conflict. 

Whatever the reason, ask yourself:
Are your sacrifices inspired by¬†pure kindness?¬†Or are they tainted by an¬†element of fear?

I‚Äôm not suggesting for us to be #selfish, but instead, that we keep a close check on our REAL motivations behind our behaviour. When we are truly being ‚Äònice‚Äô we should be operating from a place of #compassion and kindness, not from a place of fear and #weakness.

Of course, this is real life and there are going to be times when we bite our tongue, times when we keep quiet for the sake of keeping the peace, times when we choose to let it go rather than make a point of it.

But the next time you find yourself in a situation where you feel uncomfortable about defining your #boundaries, saying no, or to #speakup ‚Äì ask yourself honestly:
""Is this about being kind and compassionate or is this about me being scared to voice my own truth? And what ‚Äì if any ‚Äì are the bigger ramifications of me not doing so?""

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts? Do let me know in the comments belowüåª

instagram,"Israel has bombarded The Baptist Hospital (Al Ahli Arab Hospital) in Al Zaitoon neighborhood in central Gaza reportedly killing and injuring hundreds

The hospital is run by the Christian Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem. Richard Sewell, the Dean of St George‚Äôs College, Jerusalem called it a ""disaster"".

He said: ""Early reports say hundreds of women and children killed... The bombs must stop now. There can be no possible justification for this.""

The hospital appears to have already come under fire in the conflict, when four staff members were injured in a strike on Saturday.

The hospital was founded in 1882 and is the oldest in Gaza. It treats more than 45,000 patients every year.

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said after the first strike: ""Hospitals and patients in Gaza are in grave danger.

‚ÄúThe seriously ill and injured patients at the Anglican-run Ahli Hospital ‚Äì and other healthcare facilities in northern Gaza ‚Äì  cannot be safely evacuated. They are running low on medical supplies.""

He added: ""I appeal for the evacuation order on hospitals in northern Gaza to be reversed ‚Äì and for health facilities, health workers, patients and civilians to be protected. The evil and barbaric terror attacks on Israelis by Hamas were a blasphemous outrage. But the civilians of Gaza are not responsible for the crimes of Hamas.""

Israel has been bombarding Gaza since Hamas launched an attack on the south of the country on October 7.

Thousands have died on both sides in the ensuing conflict.

Earlier on Tuesday it was reported that six people had died at a United Nations school in a Gaza refugee camp when it was hit by an air strike.

instagram,"I have so many words and none feel worthy of the moment, but something is vibrating madly in the unknowable core of my chest right now.

I don‚Äôt have a fresh take on war, conflict, religion, or right vs wrong that feels relevant, at the moment. Maybe I will, maybe I won‚Äôt. There are countless opinions thoughtful and otherwise circulating. At the moment I have nothing to add to that conversation.

I‚Äôve been watching in horror as you have. In the hideously beautiful midst of my own grief work after helplessly watching our beautiful son die to some unseen and unknown condition, I exist now each day with a partially cracked-open heart.

When I watched this particular clip, that crack burst open, tens of thousands of years wide.

I simply cannot imagine the feeling of being in this position, my kid on a ventilator, certain to die if moved, and worrying simultaneously about a bomb falling on the hospital because of religious extremist hate. Because of the insidious cycle of revenge. Because of blind fear of some god‚Äôs petty retribution. Because of whatever the justification of the day is.

I can‚Äôt do anything to help these innocent children, just as I couldn‚Äôt ultimately help ours. And no, our situations are not at all the same. I am aware and understand my privilege to be able to post this.

My words won‚Äôt change their lives, or their fate, or probably anything at all in their situation.

I simply want to say to you, and anyone this reaches that is in pain, or the throes of existential, acute grief, or in some dangerous and impossible position right now:

I see you. I feel with you. I love you. My heart breaks with you. I will not stand silently, idly by.

I don‚Äôt want a comment section here, but you are welcome to message me if you feel called.

I encourage you to express and act your own love and goodness into the spaces available to you, just as I encourage safe and healthy and mindful places to express the opposite.

This is the shortest I could go with the context, without it losing meaning. The circumstances involved in getting to this conclusion was mind boggling. There are so many instances that need mentioning but I have skipped to make it simple to understand. 

This is just part one of the series on Israel Palestine conflict, I'll post more in the coming days.

instagram,"Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim strongly advocates for the immediate cessation of bombardment and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor in Rafah.

Anwar, in his Facebook post, said it is also imperative for Israel to abandon its adherence to the politics of dispossession, immediately implement a ceasefire with Hamas, and genuinely pursue a peaceful resolution to end the ongoing conflict.

‚ÄúI had a phone conversation with Hamas head of political bureau Ismail Haniyeh yesterday to express Malaysia‚Äôs unwavering support for the Palestinian people.

‚ÄúIt is crucial and paramount to prioritise the well-being and safety of all individuals affected by this crisis,‚Äù he said.

The prime minister also said Malaysia is committed to delivering humanitarian aid, particularly in the form of food and medicine, to alleviate the suffering of those in need.

Last Friday, Anwar said that the government would provide RM10 million in aid to the Palestinians and expressed the hope that government-linked companies, government-linked investment companies, and the private sector would contribute to raising the aid amount to RM100 million.

In 2008, Meirelles also noted how the uncontacted tribes of the region were in danger from illegal loggers in Peru which could result in conflict.

‚ÄúWhat is happening in this region [of Peru] is a monumental crime against the natural world, the tribes, the fauna and is further testimony to the complete irrationality with which we, the ‚Äòcivilized‚Äô ones, treat the world,‚Äù he said.

instagram,"At least 49 Palestinians were killed in an overnight Israeli strike that hit homes in Khan Younis and Rafah, Gaza‚Äôs interior ministry said on Tuesday.

It comes as Israel prepares to escalate an offensive in the enclave of 2.3 million people that has set off a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and raised fears of a broader conflict with Iran.

Gaza authorities say more than 2,800 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since Oct 7, around a quarter of them children, and more than 10,000 wounded are in hospitals desperately short of supplies.

instagram,"The ""window of tolerance"" is a psychological concept that describes the optimal zone within which we can effectively process and manage our emotional and psychological experiences. It's like a comfort zone for our emotional responses, where we can cope and adapt to various situations.

In the context of what we are witnessing in Palestine at the moment, those who are directly affected by the conflict have been pushed outside of their window of tolerance. Their experiences go far beyond what any human should have to endure, pushing them into states of extreme distress, fear, and pain. They are essentially in ""fight or flight"" mode, which means their bodies and minds are in a heightened state of stress, ready to either confront the danger or flee from it.

The intense grief and violence they endure overwhelm their coping mechanisms, making it difficult to find a sense of stability and emotional safety amid the chaos and bloodshed.

For those of us who are watching the events unfold from a distance, we may also find ourselves pushed outside of our window of tolerance, but perhaps in a different way. The constant stream of distressing news, images and stories can be emotionally overwhelming, leading to feelings of helplessness, anger and despair. 

Witnessing such widespread suffering and injustice can make us feel helpless or powerless, pushing us into a ""freeze"" mode. In this state, we may become emotionally and physically depleted, finding it challenging to motivate ourselves or continue with daily life.

The challenge, then, is to find a way to stay within our window of tolerance, even in the face of such traumatic events. This involves caring for our mental and physical health, finding solace in prayer and duaa, staying connected with our local communities, and taking positive actions such as raising funds and awareness where we can. 

It's crucial to acknowledge that everyone has a different level of tolerance, and what one person can endure, another may not. Be mindful of the emotional toll that witnessing such trauma is taking on you and invest in coping strategies to stay within your healthy emotional zone.

instagram,"Opinion | As I sit here on Penn‚Äôs campus, thousands of miles from any real danger or conflict, even deeper questions of what our role in the conflict should be arise.‚Å†
‚Å†
Murdering Jews, or anyone for that matter, is not standing for civil rights. Supporting an organization founded on the destruction of other people is not activism. The anger implicit in this piece does not come from a simmering hate for Gaza, but a fear for the safety of all the kids our age who are gearing up with helmets, bulletproof vests, and machine guns to drop into tanks in a hope of protecting Israeli citizens.‚Å†
‚Å†
What does it mean to helpfully support a cause from the sidelines? Does it not ring hollow to simply write an opinion column or paste words of support to my Instagram as hundreds of thousands of Israelis, many of them my age, friends, family, and classmates are putting their lives on the line? What small difference, if any, can we make in repairing the devastating attacks pointed at Israel?‚Å†
‚Å†
The answer to these questions is not nothing, it never is. The response for me instead is threefold: prayer, financial support, and most relevant, a recommitment to educating myself, and whoever will listen, on what is happening.‚Å†

And a week after the unprecedented attack on Israel, which responded with a continual raid on Gaza Strip throughout the week, experts say African countries may not suffer deaths yet, but the burden could come in the form of heightened security risks, bigger costs of importation and a geopolitical pressure on their stands.

""In the past few years, social studies teachers have found it especially challenging to find unbiased, educational, and harm-free ways to cover myriad news events ‚Äî from the COVID pandemic to George Floyd‚Äôs murder to the January 6 insurrection. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Such events often inspire passionate reactions depending on where they stand politically and ideologically. Add to the mix social media ‚Äî with its real-time images, flashy infographics, and endless hot takes ‚Äî and it is hard for almost anyone to process what is going on in a knowledgeable, thoughtful, and trauma-informed way. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Already finding it difficult to discuss these topics in the classroom, especially in states with curriculum and book bans, teachers now have a new current event with which to contend: the Israel-Hamas War. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has spanned more than three-quarters of a century, but the recent viciously violent flare-up has refocused attention on the region. ‚Å†
‚Å†
When the Hamas terrorist organization attacked Israel ‚Äî murdering some 1,300 people and kidnapping hundreds of others ‚Äî and when Israel declared war on Hamas, striking with incessant and deadly force in Gaza, home to 2 million Palestinians, about half of them children, I found myself grappling with how to discuss these tragic events with my students.

instagram,"Saleh Nikbakht, the lawyer representing the family of Mahsa Jina Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was killed in Iranian state custody last year, has been handed a one-year prison sentence. 

This unjust sentencing comes as part of a broader trend affecting several prominent human rights lawyers in Iran who have found themselves being prosecuted by kangaroo courts for taking on politically sensitive cases and diligently fulfilling their roles as legal advocates.

Saleh Nikbakht received this sentence at a time when the world's attention was largely diverted by the Israel-Palestine conflict. 

This sentence should be loudly condemned by lawyers' rights groups and anyone who supports human rights lawyers.

Life Framer comment ‚Äì There is an effortless, soft palette used throughout this scene, enabling shadow and geometry to mix seamlessly within the warm sunlight. The concrete archway appears almost organic as it frames the sea and horizon line without conflict, allowing the viewer a glimpse of the ocean as they contemplate the scene. An exceptional composition elevated by a balanced use of color and tone, not to mention the small pigeon bringing some levity as it goes about its morning business.

instagram,"Police in Brussels on Tuesday morning shot a man suspected of carrying out the fatal shooting of two Swedish nationals in the city center on Monday night. Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden later confirmed that the suspect was killed after police encountered him in a cafe in the Belgian capital's Schaerbeek neighborhood. ""The perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died,"" Verlinden wrote on social media. Belgium had raised the security alert status of Brussels to the highest level in the wake of the attack, ramping up police presence. Officers tracked down the suspect after an intensive manhunt. 
The automatic rifle found close to the person who was shot was the same weapon as the one used during the Monday evening attack, Interior Minister Verlinden told broadcaster VRT. Two Swedish nationals were shot dead in the attack and a third one was wounded. The suspect fled the scene in central Brussels after the shooting, as a football match between Belgium and Sweden was about to start. The match was subsequently called off. The suspect, who had identified himself as a member of the so-called ""Islamic State"" terror group, claimed responsibility in a video posted online. Earlier, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said the suspect was a man of Tunisian origin who was living in Belgium illegally. The attacker was known to police in connection with people smuggling. He had unsuccessfully sought asylum in Belgium in November 2019.

Assessment
There is a realistic possibility that the conflict in Israel influenced this attack and that the increase in pro-islamic protests emboldened this attacker. Following this logic, it is also likely that other lone wolf style terrorists may attempt to conduct similar attacks in the short and medium term.

instagram,"Residents in the Gaza Strip are still facing severe water shortages after Israel turned water supplies back on in parts of southern #Gaza on Sunday, Oct. 15. Water supplies only lasted for three hours, and only benefits 14 percent of 2.2 million population in Gaza Strip, the UN said on Monday.

The UN recognizes that access to #water as a human right. The lack of clean water is putting lives in danger, raising concerns for #dehydration, and spread of #infections like cholera and dysentery, the UN says.

Water supplies in the Gaza Strip rely on neighborhood #desalination facilities and public taps, as the region‚Äôs only aquifer is #contaminated by sewage, chemicals, and seawater.

instagram,"Oftentimes, the way we interact with the world stems from our upbringing, and whether it's direct or indirect, it ends up impacting us greatly in our daily lives.

We may have found ourselves in situations where we're unnecessarily mean to others and end up guilt-tripping and gaslighting them, among many other red flags, when we're faced with conflict. Sometimes, we're the perpetrators, and other times, the victims.

It doesn't matter if you're a parent, a child, or a friend looking for ways to grow into becoming better human beings for the people in our lives. There is no time better to start embarking on the journey to healing than now.

For as long as the stock market has existed (hundreds of years) it‚Äôs always been a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs along the way. But the overall trajectory over the long term has always been up! üìà

There‚Äôs always a new financial story or global conflict that causes stocks to crash down. But don‚Äôt let fear and uncertainty keep you from investing! As Warren Buffett once famously said; ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when they‚Äôre fearful.‚Äù

The stock market is one of the most resilient and proven wealth building mechanisms in the world. It‚Äôs made it through every war, economic crisis, natural disaster, and everything else ever thrown at it.

The trick is to stay consistent and hold long term, compounding will do the rest üìàüíØ

instagram,"A better filter‚Ä¶

Too many of us give lip service to excellence and doing work that matters but then walk the path of least resistance.

We filter our days through a series of micro-decisions to avoid conflict and confrontation, effort and struggle, pain and failure.

Then we wonder why we‚Äôre in the same anxious, dissatisfied place we were a week ago, a month ago, a year ago‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs a simple filter to fix this problem:

* Is it easy?

If the answer is ‚Äúyes,‚Äù it‚Äôs the wrong project, activity, path, etc. 

If you want to grow as a leader, salesperson, parent, lover, etc. ‚Äúeasy‚Äù should be a negative filter. 

Nothing worth doing is easy, not over the long term‚Ä¶

Purpose. Happiness. Satisfaction. These are the result of struggle, of working through pain despite fear and anxiety. 

Easy is a trigger warning that you‚Äôre on the wrong path‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶or that you‚Äôre not working hard enough, not committed, or living someone else‚Äôs life. 

Easy is for the ordinary. 

Ordinary people want easy. They seek it out. Everything they do is to make life easy‚Ä¶ 

Are you ordinary?

That is an honest question. 

Because for some people, ordinary is completely acceptable, and that‚Äôs fine.

These people would rather not deal with the pain and struggle of a meaningful life‚Ä¶a life spent, much like Sisyphus, pushing rocks uphill in the effort of work that matters.

These ordinary people seek refuge in Netflix, drugs, porn, excuse-making, and any number of other instant gratification distractions meant to dull the pain the regret buried deep down in their souls.

I just didn‚Äôt think that was you. 

Wait‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not you? You don‚Äôt accept ordinary? You feel called to make a dent in the world?

Then why the f*ck would want anything to be easy?!

Find what‚Äôs hard in your life, and then take Ryan Holiday‚Äôs advice, ‚ÄúThe obstacle is the way.‚Äù

That hard conversation with your lover; have it today

Writing that book you can‚Äôt get out of your head; start typing today

Building muscle and taking control of your health; push some f*cking iron around today.

If it‚Äôs not hard, it‚Äôs most likely meaningless.

‚Ä¶and why waste your life on meaningless stuff?

Seek out hard things.

This is the way.

instagram,"Police in Brussels on Tuesday morning shot a man suspected of carrying out the fatal shooting of two Swedish nationals in the city center on Monday night. Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden later confirmed that the suspect was killed after police encountered him in a cafe in the Belgian capital's Schaerbeek neighborhood. ""The perpetrator of the terrorist attack in Brussels has been identified and has died,"" Verlinden wrote on social media. Belgium had raised the security alert status of Brussels to the highest level in the wake of the attack, ramping up police presence. Officers tracked down the suspect after an intensive manhunt. 
The automatic rifle found close to the person who was shot was the same weapon as the one used during the Monday evening attack, Interior Minister Verlinden told broadcaster VRT. Two Swedish nationals were shot dead in the attack and a third one was wounded. The suspect fled the scene in central Brussels after the shooting, as a football match between Belgium and Sweden was about to start. The match was subsequently called off. The suspect, who had identified himself as a member of the so-called ""Islamic State"" terror group, claimed responsibility in a video posted online. Earlier, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said the suspect was a man of Tunisian origin who was living in Belgium illegally. The attacker was known to police in connection with people smuggling. He had unsuccessfully sought asylum in Belgium in November 2019. 
Source: AFP, Reuters

Assessment
There is a realistic possibility that the conflict in Israel influenced this attack and that the increase in pro-islamic protests emboldened this attacker. Following this logic, it is also likely that other lone wolf style terrorists may attempt to conduct similar attacks in the short and medium term.

Pinter, P.I #1

By Lisa Boyle @lisaboylewrites 

For @suzyapprovedbooktours

Out Oct. 24, 2023

I‚Äôve read Lisa‚Äôs historical fiction Paddy series so I was excited to see how she does with a genre switch into mystery. I can tell you she did AMAZING.

This is a multilayered and atmospheric mystery set in 1979 New Mexico.  It‚Äôs told in multiple points of view (like about 7) which I really enjoyed. It mixes some true life events with a fictional mystery and fictional characters.

The two main characters are James and Molly, a father and his fourteen year old daughter. James is an ex Army investigator who is now a truck driver. Molly comes to start living with James after her mother dies. I enjoy the way that Lisa writes about this very new father/daughter relationship.

The book takes place on and near a Navajo reservation so the reader gets a behind the scenes look at the politics that goes on there.

The Vietnam War plays a role in the story which is very interesting for me because I was a child during the later years of that conflict.

The mystery itself which is about a woman who is found dead by suspected overdose outside the reservation is great and all the characters add to the telling of the plot.

I look forward to reading the next installment of Pinter, P.I.

instagram,"üì¢ New pamphlet from Firebrand, our national organization

üáµüá∏ Palestinian liberation by any means necessary

üáµüá∏ Stop the Genocide
Israel‚Äôs settler-colonial project has again shown its true nature. In retaliation for the new military phase of the Palestinian liberation movement that started on October 7th, the Zionist entity is committing open genocide against Gaza. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu absurdly and cynically tells the residents of Gaza to leave or face death. The whole world knows the residents of Gaza are in the largest open-air prison in the world. They cannot leave.

üáµüá∏ Smash apartheid
Apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and bombing civilians are all fundamental to the Zionist project. There can be no Israel without them. Talk of a two-state solution only provides cover for the continued oppression and dispossession of Palestinians. Even Palestinians within the pre-1967 borders are citizens in name only. We support the long-standing Palestinian demand for a single democratic, secular Palestine open to all.

üáµüá∏ Watchdog state for the US
The Zionist entity serves US imperialism as a military outpost, economic partner, and police agent in the region. US imperialism is a bipartisan project. Since Palestine was colonized in 1948, both Democrats and Republicans have backed the Zionist expulsion, dispossession, and oppression of the Palestinian people. The US often pretends to be a mediator between Israel and Palestine. It never is. It always backs Israel.

üáµüá∏ Zionist socialists?!
US government officials who claim to be socialists, including Bernie Sanders and DSA members, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman, have disgustingly climbed on the Zionist bandwagon and denounced Hamas‚Äô ‚Äúterrorism.‚Äù Biden has gone so far as to call the Palestinian offensive antisemitic, when it is really anti-colonial. The target is not a religion, but a state based on stealing Palestinian land. This is not an ancient conflict, but a modern one created by imperialism and the settler-colonial project.

instagram,"Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has stressed today that Israel must immediately call for a ceasefire in Gaza, amid the bloody retaliation against the surprise attack by the Islamist militant group Hamas.

Anwar also said that he had extended Malaysia's ‚Äúunwavering‚Äù support for the Palestinians in a phone call to Hamas' head of political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh.

‚ÄúGiven the dire situation in Gaza, I strongly advocate for the immediate cessation of bombardment and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor in Rafah,‚Äù he said in a statement here.

‚ÄúIt is also imperative for Israel to abandon their adherence to the politics of dispossession, immediately ceasefire with Hamas and genuinely pursue a peaceful resolution to end the ongoing conflict.""

‚ÄúPolitics of dispossession‚Äù is a term popularised by Palestinian-American academic and political activist Edward Said, which refers to how groups of people are systematically deprived of their land, resources, rights, and identities, which in this case means the forced displacement of Palestinians started by the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.

Anwar said that it is crucial and paramount to prioritise the well-being and safety of all individuals affected by this crisis.

instagram,"Our client F was taught from a young age that rest and play is laziness, and that productivity and good grades are what make her parents approve of her.

Her mother would frantically storm into her room when she was playing with her toys and demand that she do something ""useful"" around the house.

F learned that not being productive was bad.

Fast forward to a Saturday morning, when her husband is playing video games.

F feels her blood start to boil.
How could he be so lazy?
Doesn't he see that I'm running around the house cleaning up?
Did I marry the wrong person?

Since F has learned to reject the part of herself that desires rest and play, she can only see her husband's video game playing as a major flaw.

She believes that he is the problem and if he would just be more productive, she wouldn't feel so triggered...

This caused so much anxiety and conflict in her relationship.
She didn't want to be critical toward him, but she felt like she didn't have another option.

Through our work, F learned in her BODY that it was safe to rest and play.
She embraced the part of herself that she believed was ""bad.""

This completely shifted her approach toward her husband and his enjoyment of Saturday morning video games. She could now see her husband's light, playful demeanor as a reminder to not be so productive and serious all the time.

She even picked up a playful hobby of her own!

Some 2.3 million residents of Gaza are without electricity amid Israel‚Äôs siege of the territory, jeopardizing water and health services there, Reuters reported on Monday morning. The U.S. has shipped firepower to the area to discourage Iran from joining in and to prevent a broader regional war.

Now, as some observers fear that the conflict could spawn an all-out world war, certain Texas leaders are airing their stances on the matter.

On Sunday, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson wrote on his Medium account that the city is backing Israel. The city clearly spelled out its support for Israel by turning its skyline blue, WFAA reported last Wednesday night. 

Meanwhile, a peaceful protest in support of Palestine took place in Dallas on Sunday, attracting an estimated 1,000-plus attendees. Demonstrators carried Palestinian flags and conducted a march.

instagram,"The escalation in violence between Israeli and Hamas forces over the past week has seen a deluge of misinformation from official and unofficial sources on both sides of the conflict.

Some of this misinformation takes the form of false videos or unconfirmed narratives intended to demonstrate either the prowess of the military on one side or the brutality and violence perpetrated by fighters on the other.

The rapidly evolving conflict makes it particularly easy for misinformation to spread and, with tech firms struggling to contain and verify falsehoods, some of these narratives have reached Malta‚Äôs shores and come to be repeated and shared in local debates on social media.

We examine some of the false or unverified claims that have emerged over the past days.

instagram,"Taking to social media, Labour MP Omar Farrugia issued his position, and a response to that of Roberta Metsola and Ursula von Der Leyen, when it comes to the conflict in Israel and Gaza. 

Farrugia, whilst condemning the Hamas attack, also highlighted how the blood being spilt in Gaza should acquire the same condemnation. 

‚ÄòPeople forced to leave their homes, parents and children dying, families separated - in a place that has been under siege for years now and is currently being bombarded. 

‚ÄòThe European Union had its chance to be the voice of peace and compromise. Instead, we sought photos and poses. We looked to side only with one side, even when we knew that retaliation meant more death and destruction.‚Äô 

Addressing Metsola, Farrugia said that the EU has no power or mandate, from Malta or elsewhere, to give their support to Israel‚Äôs offensive. The EU, he said, should be attempting to bring the two sides to the table and stop the fighting immediately. 

‚ÄòNot trying to paint a pretty picture of revenge by Israel on innocent people. Nothing good comes out of a war. No violence on innocent lives is justifiable. This is what our representatives in the EU should be saying and working for.‚Äô 

This comes after EP President Metsola, along with Commission president von der Leyen visited Israel to show their support following the attacks.

In a speech addressed to the plenary, Metsola condemned the mass murder, kidnappings, rapes, torture and mutilations carried out by Hamas. 

‚ÄòEven in the darkest of times, our Parliament has always and will always push for a fair two-state solution that is equitable and just. We will always push for a sustainable and lasting peace. Sadly, the vile actions of Hamas terrorists have pushed this prospect further away.' 

‚ÄòOur focus must remain on ensuring that the hostages kidnapped are released unconditionally, that humanitarian aid reaches those in need, that civilians are not targeted, that safe corridors are maintained', said Metsola.

instagram,"this week was hard. heavy. intense. 

but it was even harder for my Jewish friends, Muslim friends, Palestinian friends, and Israeli friends. i‚Äôve done my best to check in with them, but it doesn‚Äôt seem enough. 

i know this post isn‚Äôt going to make everyone happy, but it isn‚Äôt supposed to, and it‚Äôs where i‚Äôm at without waver. 

if you haven‚Äôt taken the time to learn about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the video by @voxdotcom i mentioned in Inclusive Strategies workbook is in my bio. 

as mentioned in my stories, this video was created in 2016. So much more has happened since then, obviously. Please do your own research and be vigilant of information going through your feeds right now.

if you have the workbook, you can scan the QR code or click the link in the interactive pdf on page 43. 

if you don‚Äôt have it, i will not be selling it for the sake of this conflict, simply because there‚Äôs so many more people you could learn from on this topic better than me. my one page in my workbook does not do the 75 years this conflict has unfolded into justice. 

my friends over at @jewishvoiceforpeace is one of the groups with so many resources and connections to work from. please give them a follow. 

i am leaving my comments on, but please know that if you showcase any anti-semitism, islamophobia, or any level of discrimination on this post, you will be blocked and your comment will be removed. 

there is no room for hate here. there is no room for the justification of genocide.
there is only space to learn, myself included.

to everyone who is hurting because of this, i am so deeply sorry, and please know i hold so much love and space for you.",,259,"{'like_count': 224, 'comment_count': 35, 'num_users': 7302}",vp wright | life curator,,2023-10-17 03:22:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/377950666_679347937412717_316219385202588759_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Gicd2jcdBdcAX9rlIq1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBKo3Ge6IDJ23FuLBoCo-_PdqmWas7EZZWVnwZRb07DeQ&oe=6559C306,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyfBSfQuUTh/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392760184_593390969511374_730956659850142597_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nZeMM7PZrogAX_vf4g8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAkE8h1EvLVts29RSV86lWkTaBBhbP6WpsBid5V6mhADg&oe=6558B40F

instagram,"Repost from @takeonhate: ""The heinous hate crime against a Muslim Palestinian American family in Illinois yesterday is a direct result of the sickening rhetoric coming from the White House, elected officials, and mainstream media. Their unconditional support for Israel during a conflict that has killed thousands of innocent civilians only fuels hate of Arab and/or Muslim Americans and reinforces the dehumanization of an entire population. The killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a child stabbed 26 times, and the stabbing of his mother shows the devastating impact of systemic Islamophobia.

We call on the President, our elected officials, and mainstream media to stand on the right side of history, to be just and equitable and denounce the ethnic cleansing of innocent Palestinian civilians.

instagram,"Enneagram Type Nines, the Peacemakers, embody a parenting style marked by warmth, acceptance, and a steady presence. Their homes often become a safe haven where each family member feels unconditionally loved and accepted just as they are. Nurturing by nature, Type 9 parents foster a harmonious environment where their children are encouraged to grow without judgment.

Yet, every strength comes with its flip side. Their aversion to conflict might mean that Nines sometimes avoid tough conversations, and their accommodating nature could potentially morph into neglect of their own needs and desires. The peace they so cherish might at times deter them from addressing necessary disputes and from asserting their own boundaries. At times, their desire to maintain harmony may also lead them to reluctantly say 'yes' when a 'no' might be more beneficial.

It feels ridiculous to promote a book release when such horrors and inhumane acts are occuring in the world, but I truly believe that books can help us survive reality, provide escapism, and help us process the pain going on all around us.

What I love about teaching the psychodynamics of conflict mediation studies, Art Therapy and Sex Therapy, is that it gives me an opportunity to zoom out and translate the nuances of this complex field to other enthusiasts.

Thanks for having me for so long Mumbai, it was wonderful to be nurtured by your all-embracing spirit especially during #navratri in #India‚ù§Ô∏è 

üôèüèæüåå Swami Samartha - visiting you was absolutely awe-inspiring!

instagram,"My mother is Pahari, from the hills in India, and #Dussehra is a significant celebration in that area. We would go to the local mandir, where I fondly remember seeing the Ravana Dahan, the effigy burning, symbolizing the victory of good over evil. This story and the triumph of Sri Rama over Ravana greatly influenced how I view conflict and the concept of conquering evil.
.
Our family's celebrations have evolved, particularly with my Gujarati wife. We now participate in garba and dandiya events, and watching my daughters join in, including the Arati and devotional aspects, is a wonderful experience. Passing down the tradition to my children, especially during Navaratri, with its focus on the Feminine Divine, is very meaningful to me.
.
In America, the challenge lies in synchronizing our celebrations with the regular calendar due to work and school obligations. The @HinduAmerican has been instrumental in supporting those who need to take time off by providing resources and templates for communicating with schools and employers. Their educational resources have been invaluable for celebrating these festivals in schools and sharing our traditions.
.
I hope for greater awareness and understanding of these traditions in the future. While Diwali is more recognized, #Navaratri and Dussehra deserve similar recognition. It's important that we're understood not only as a community that celebrates with dances but also as one that reveres the Divine.
.
Being part of the HAF community and witnessing its growth has been a truly amazing experience, and I'm excited for the future and the impact we can make.

instagram,"If you feel like you are losing your mind right now, do not panic. Take a deep breath. Losing your mind feels terrifying at first because you are losing/letting go of ideas and concepts that you‚Äôve held your whole life. 
Awakenings of the soul don‚Äôt always look pretty. It was quite the opposite for me. I fought everything. I felt like I was going crazy, dying, suffocating, screaming on the inside, and I was so uncomfortable in my own being. 
I was realizing how infinite the soul was, but the ideas in my head all held limitations so my true nature was met with resistance. There was a major internal conflict causing so much tension. I was trying to use my mind to escape my mind. Only adding to it all. 
But losing my mind would be the beginning of my spiritual journey. Allowing me to connect to a deeper place within my being that is beyond the mind. I still forget and get lost in the thinking mind, but I am much quicker to become aware of that now and bring my attention back to the present moment. 
So if you feel lost, scared, trapped or going crazy do not panic. I truly believe this is all a part of the spiritual journey. Finding out who we are not, so that we may know who we are. Be kind to yourself. You are right where you are supposed to be.

instagram,"Small acts are sometimes a balm for devastating loss and anger. As the Israeli military continues to plan its retaliation for the attacks of 7/10, some people have been voicing their feelings through graffiti. As I‚Äôve been moving around the region, messages of defiance have become an increasingly regular sight.

In Tel Aviv, the family of Mia Shem held a press conference following her appearance in a video released by Hamas overnight. Taken hostage while attending the Nova Peace Festival, Mia is seen being bandaged and pleading to be allowed to return home. The New York Times reported that at least some of the video was filmed six days ago.

Later in the day, Shiraz Tamam was buried in Holon cemetery. Also in attendance at the same festival as Mia, Shiraz was one of 260 killed during the attack.

instagram,"In a bombshell, an image worth a thousand words... But the timing of it adds a thousand more.

In the context of war, bombings and death are often seen as necessary evils, with the hope that they will ultimately lead to a swift end to the conflict. However, the stories of those who have experienced the devastating effects of bombings serve as a reminder of the human cost of war and the need to work towards peaceful solutions to conflicts.

Over a week in, the ongoing escalation of hostilities in Israel and Gaza is having a deep physical and mental impact on children and their families in the region. 

UNICEF is scaling up its response in Gaza and calls for an immediate ceasefire and a humanitarian corridor to ensure the safe delivery of life-saving supplies. UNICEF staff have continued to respond to the critical needs of children across the Gaza Strip, but access is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous, and nearly all our prepositioned supplies in the region are distributed. We have now prepositioned additional supplies in Egypt for deployment as soon as humanitarian access is established.

instagram,"From Beni to Oicha, Butembo to Rutshuru and Fataki. In the towns of East Congo, peace activists support their communities in the midst of relentless conflict, 2022. They speak with local garrisons, bring supplies and find shelter for those displaced by fighting. They track which towns may be safe for civilians to return to, sharing scarce information from remote red zones.
They form groups to source cash and bring assistance for widows of dead troops, also keeping an eye on their sons and brothers to prevent recruitment by rebel groups. Some of this work is dangerous, almost all of it is unsung.

The cause of the conflict was still sketchy as of press time. However, The PUNCH was reliably informed of the clash by a titled Chief in the community.

The source said a group of herdsmen had invaded a farm in the community with their cattle and grazed on it,  a situation which led to the demise of the owner of the farm during the argument.

Small scale businesses or established entrepreneurs even, not a single business house that hasn‚Äôt been affected. The income has been either too low or non generating, leaving many businesses on the verge of shutting down or getting bankrupt.

ETENG, which translates to self-help in Manipuri is an initiative by MW in collaboration with 20+ businesses- altogether for each other. We‚Äôll be coming together to create a community support system where we shout out for each other‚Äôs business houses as we do for ours as well.

On asked how each business has been individually affected, this is what our collaborating team shared with us:

When you have witnessed the worst form of violence and have lost everything to the conflict, finding a way forward is almost impossible. Fighting against vengeance and all odds, striving for a livelihood is how everyone is trying to find their way forward.

instagram,"#ArtFairPH/Projects 2023: ""Delusions of Grandeur Woke Farm"" by Pow Martinez (@_powmartinez_)

Known for paintings that are once grotesque yet described as ‚Äúindelibly beautiful,‚Äù #PowMartinez continues the ‚Äúbad art‚Äù tradition in Philippine contemporary art popularized by such notables as Manuel Ocampo and Jason Oliveira. Characterized by lurid colors, bold strokes, and elements of the uncanny, his surreal scenes constitute a critique of modern life, in which figures‚Äîusually freaks, monsters, and outsiders of society‚Äîperform seemingly banal tasks against a mishmash of elements, seeming to extract normalcy from the disarray. Martinez challenges the viewer to consider their relationship with his works, particularly the imposition of meaning onto something that resists such an attempt. His every work may be seen as an invitation to be at ease with the disorder, especially in such a socio-political climate where even ‚Äúrealities‚Äù can be manufactured.

While Martinez paints otherworldly scenarios, he draws inspiration from recent events, watching YouTube documentaries on conflict zones and the climate crisis. The news of the day is then refracted through the artist‚Äôs untamed imagination, which then churns out complex forms, shapes, and textures. His subjects, in relation to their surroundings, give off hyper-focused expressions that evoke a sense of detachment. Such an attitude may be the condition‚Äîor the predicament‚Äîof living in the moment, when the only certainty seems to be the annihilation of the human species.

instagram,"A Century of Bloodshed

As Israel continues to pound besieged Gaza at a huge human cost ‚Äì nearly 3,000 killed, in retaliation to an embarrassing Hamas raid into the mainland, Muhammad Nadeem offers a precise chronology of the conflict that has eluded a solution for a long timeBefore World War I (1914-18), Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. Zionist immigration and settlement started increasing through land purchases that often displaced the majority of Arab peasants. In 1917 Balfour Declaration pledged British support for a Jewish national home in Palestine despite Arabs comprising more than 90 per cent of the population. It amounted to a declaration of war against the Palestinians.In the interwar period, the British governed Palestine under a League of Nations Mandate drafted to facilitate the Zionist project. Jewish immigration expanded rapidly, the Jewish population tripled, and the Zionist para-state controlled large tracts of strategic land. Palestinians resisted through protests, riots, and strikes, but the conservative leadership‚Äôs appeals to Britain were futile.

Frustration led to the 1936-39 Arab Revolt. Though violently suppressed by Britain, the revolt obliged a policy shift. The 1939 White Paper proposed limits on Jewish land purchases and immigration, but its provisions were not implemented before the war erupted. By 1939, the British-supported Zionist movement had the population base and military capacity to establish control over Palestine.

Palestinians were politically divided, socially conservative, and disadvantaged by the single-minded Organization of the Zionist movement compared to their own ineffective leadership. The British practice of divide-and-rule aggravated these problems.

Britain provided force, which violently crushed the Arab Revolt. By the end of the Mandate, the Zionist para-state apparatus was in place to assert control. Palestinian demands for self-determination and independence were denied, and the country fatefully transformed against the will of its indigenous Arab majority.

instagram,"Israeli Indiscriminate and relentless air strikes on Gaza continued today defying ceasefire calls, as the death toll in the Palestinian enclave rose past 3,000, about one-third of them children.

At least six people were killed when a school was hit during air strikes in the al-Maghazi refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, said the United Nations.

Dozens of others were injured, and it's thought the numbers will increase, according to the statement from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

""This is outrageous, and it again shows a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians,"" the statement adds. ""No place is safe in Gaza anymore, not even UNRWA facilities.""

UNRWA says the hit took place during Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.

It adds: ""At least 4,000 people have taken refuge in this UNRWA school turned shelter. They had and still have nowhere else to go.""

Israel has bombarded the Gaza Strip with air strikes displacing around half of the 2.3 million Gazans from their homes. It has imposed a total blockade on the enclave, halting food, fuel and medical supplies, which are rapidly running out.

US President Joe Biden will visit Israel today to show support for its war on Hamas amid fears that escalating war may spiral into a wider Middle East conflict.

On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel‚Äôs bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.‚Äù

Thanks to your support and daily donations to our targeted fundraisers, we can continue to feed animals from the conflict zones. In the photos, you can see just a few of them. We're delighted to have helped so many lives together üôå

Yesterday, we sent pet food supplies:
‚ñ∂Ô∏è 200 kg to 150 animals in Dnipro. Tetiana Kalvasinska takes care of animals that were rescued from the streets and are now residents of the ""Meow Woof"" shelter;
‚ñ∂Ô∏è 110 kg to 30 cats and 16 dogs in Mykolaiv. Vladlena Hamenytsia cares for her own animals and looks after strays. Despite her disability, she continues to make every effort to help animals;
‚ñ∂Ô∏è 50 kg to 10 dogs in Donetsk, under Tetiana Shumakova‚Äôs care. She feeds the animals that live near her workplace. They were rescued and raised by the military, and now Tetiana takes care of them;
‚ñ∂Ô∏è 40 kg to 20 cats in Kharkiv, cared for by Olena Artakova. She feeds, treats, and tries to find families for homeless animals.

üíâ Per day, we sterilized 188 animals for UAH 167 050 ($ 4523).

I needed to get this out, because I feel like it might help me step away from social media again for a while. 
On one hand I feel it is so important to be on here, educating and sharing information to fight disinformation (I appreciate everyone who‚Äôs reached out thanking me for doing so and helping them understand the conflict)
On the other hand, I am way to distracted by all this, and emotionally/mentally drained at a time when my wife, daughter and clients need me the most. So at some point soon I will probably be signing off for a bit to be available to them, and to myself.

I wish you all the strength to follow the light and the truth and take care of yourselves as best as possible. Love you

instagram,"Enlightenment, in its simplest form, is about accepting reality as it is, without resistance. It‚Äôs about letting go of our preconceived notions, our judgments, our desires for how things should be. It‚Äôs about embracing the present moment, in all its beauty and imperfection.
Resistance creates conflict, tension, and suffering. It‚Äôs a barrier that keeps us from experiencing life fully, from seeing the truth clearly. When we resist what is, we create a divide between ourselves and reality. We become entangled in our thoughts, our fears, our illusions.
On the other hand, the absence of resistance brings peace, clarity, and freedom. It allows us to flow with life, rather than against it. It opens our eyes to the wonder of the present moment, to the wisdom inherent in each experience.
So, let‚Äôs strive for enlightenment. Let‚Äôs strive to let go of resistance, to accept what is. Let‚Äôs strive to live in the present, to embrace reality as it is. Because in the end, enlightenment is nothing more than the complete absence of resistance to what is.
Remember, the journey to enlightenment is not a destination, but a journey. It‚Äôs not about reaching a certain point, but about continuously growing, learning, and evolving. It‚Äôs about embracing humility, fostering empathy, and recognizing our interconnectedness. So, let‚Äôs embark on this journey, one step at a time, one breath at a time. Because in the end, we are not just individuals on separate paths, but parts of a larger whole, moving together towards enlightenment.

instagram,"The international community has been divided over the past week with its support for Israel and Palestine in the ongoing conflict.

Tensions escalated in the region following Hamas‚Äô surprise attack on Israel more than a week ago. Following this, Israel declared war and has carried out brutal air attacks on the besieged enclave as casualties continue to mount. There have been multiple attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank as well.

Greenpeace condemns all forms of violence, captures, massacres, human rights violations and grave international crimes.

In shock by the events that continue to unfold, Greenpeace stands in solidarity with everyone affected. We hope that all parties involved in the violent conflict will immediately stop fighting so that innocent lives can be saved.

Greenpeace supports calls for an immediate ceasefire and for urgent humanitarian aid to be delivered. We support calls for the immediate return of all hostages.

The cycle of violence will continue to perpetuate itself, if this is allowed to go on, many more will suffer.

The chant of ‚ÄúFrom the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free‚Äù, a rallying cry long used by Hamas, is completely reprehensible.

The chant is calling for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory which encompasses the State of Israel.

In other words, these protesters are calling for a Palestinian state instead of - not in addition to - Israel.

instagram,"The West was understandably shocked and appalled by Hamas's massacre in Israel. Nothing can justify or rationalize such a display of cruelty. 

Neither the continuing occupation of the West Bank since 1967, with its attendant violence, nor the rise of Jewish Supremacism, once relegated to the fringes of Israeli society before being whitewashed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, nor the abandonment of Palestine by the Arab countries, the United States and Europe.

On the other hand, these three factors cannot be ignored as Israel's ground operation creeps ever closer; they determine Israel's response.

Israeli society is reeling from the horror of the terrorist operation. Discredited for failing to prevent the attack, the government and army are under immense pressure. It must react. Punish. It must strike. 

Israel faces a precipice. The Hamas attack is also a trap. It destroys the deterrence at the heart of Israel's security doctrine, forcing it to radically review its traditional militarized management of the enclave. 

The premeditation of this attack is a disproportionate and indiscriminate response, in disregard of the two million civilians living in Gaza. The price Israel could pay for a large-scale operation goes beyond the human toll. Its alliances, regional security and very soul are at stake.

That Israel has the right to defend itself does not answer the question of the purpose of a ground invasion. The law of retaliation cannot take the place of military strategy.

Without even mentioning the phenomenal cost in civilian lives that lies ahead, no one on the Israeli side has the time or desire to consider what will come next. What will emerge from the ashes, if not more fire?

instagram,"A PRAYER FOR PEACE

Today the world is praying for peace in the Holy Land. Add your voice:

God of all nations, 
we pray today for Israel and Gaza.

We pray for those grieving the sudden loss of loved ones, captives, and those whose homes have been destroyed.

We pray for a miraculous de-escalation of this conflict, asking for reason to overcome rage and revenge. We also ask that other nations will be restrained from escalating this situation further.

We pray for effective international peacemaking, seeking diplomacy over warmongering on all sides. Blessed are the merciful and the peacemakers. (Matthew 5:7, 9)

Amen.

instagram,"In a ‚Äútech-first‚Äù society, it is increasingly difficult to differentiate between authentic information and false claims or deliberately misleading video content. It is clear that numerous videos, social media posts and images purportedly about the Israel‚ÄìHamas conflict are deliberately misleading.

This problem highlights why the verification efforts of journalists reporting on conflicts are vital. And understanding how they work is important for ensuring the public can have confidence in what they read and see from media publishers.

instagram,"I‚Äôm packing up to ship to Oakland. I‚Äôve been desperately trying to shoot everything to get a good record of it all and to have images for other projects. This is Omega S 380649 a piece I am still in love with. I don‚Äôt say that in some romantic artwank way. There is something about this piece that has captured me from the start. I saw this mannequin head in a flea market a few years back and stopped in my tracks. I get final pieces, complete 3D images in my head when I find a core element (it varies from each piece). That plastic head, for me, was always going to be this piece. It took a few years to get to it. Even as I worked on it, in the rough stages, I went to bed each night with some deep attachment for me. If she does not find a home at this show, I will retire this piece and keep it hidden for me alone. I‚Äôve never done that before, but I honestly will never tire, never be bored, never stop finding awe in Omega S. ¬†

I hope that anyone making art of any kind has at least one piece that they grow more fond of with time.¬†

Her story is on my site if you‚Äôre interested. She was one of the few successful consciousness transfers from the Omega Group. A secret cabal of scientists who saw the eminent end to the Conflict and knew that humans would lose out in the end. They began, in desperation, to save themselves with the limited resources they had by transferring their consciousnesses to long term vessels.¬†

Okay, the main conflict got mentioned again, finally? Some ideas were finally connected? Is this plot development? Is this a step in the right direction? I can't tell. Fujimoto has spewed so many ideas and concepts onto the pages of this part without developing them that I might need to reread it to assess it fairly. Regardless, pacing has been horrible until now, but at least it looks like ideas are coming together in a semi sensible way.

Additionally, I'm sure we're going to see someone complain about whether Asa gets killed off being left as a cliffhanger for another chapter (going into a 2 week hiatus).

‚Å£
Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. The Israeli occupation has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.‚Å£
‚Å£
On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli occupation forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli (occupation) forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

instagram,"I have family and friends in Israel. I know no one has been untouched by Hamas‚Äô violent acts. There is never an excuse for terrorism. 

And, what about the terror, systematic dehumanization that the IDF and Israeli government has imposed on Palestinians for decades? 

I do not, cannot stand with the right-wing, authoritarian government of Israel just as I could not, would not stand with the U.S. government in 2003 during the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. My activism did not make me any less American. Why does my activism against the inhumane policies of Israel continue to call my Judaism into question? 

We are a generous, thoughtful, values-rich people. But I am now questioning this community‚Äôs ability to hold nuance and act on our values. 

I am questioning its ability to hold people like me, desperately in search of solace and a community where we can say no to Israeli death but we can also question and even object to the actions of the Israeli government, which commits acts of violence in the name of the Jewish people. 

We are staring down the barrel of an ethnic cleansing in Gaza as vengeful Israeli tanks get into position. Where are our voices now? Do our Jewish values not tell us that violence should not beget violence, that flattening Gaza won‚Äôt bring back the dead nor defeat Hamas nor bring peace? 

The only thing that will bring peace is centering each other‚Äôs humanity, and while the conflict is complicated, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs actually quite simple. We would be in a different place today if we had built systems that recognized rather than denigrated Palestinian humanity.

On his second deployment, Chief Warrant Officer Rivera had the opportunity to serve as an advisor to the South Vietnamese Army. In addition to his two tours in Vietnam, he also deployed to Korea as well as South and Central America. 

In his 32-year-long career, he served at duty stations throughout Panama, Washington, D.C., Germany, Maryland, and California before retiring from the U.S. Army in 1984. Following his retirement, he worked for the U.S. Army at the Defense Language Institute at Presidio of Monterey. There, he continued to support his fellow Service Members to teach them the languages necessary for the current conflicts of the world. Chief Warrant Officer Rivera instilled in his family a great honor for Military Service and the values he learned during his career in the U.S. Army. To this day, his son Ron Rivera (@riverboatronhc), head coach of the Washington @commanders , continues to honor his service by proudly wearing CW4 on his hat during salute to service weeks. Ron also serves as an advocate for his players and team members to continue to give back to Service Members and Veterans. 

It is with great pride that we name #WCCsChief in honor of United States Army Chief Warrant Officer Eugenio Rivera

instagram,"Anger and bloodshed have surged since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, sparking a war that has claimed thousands of lives, with most of the dead on both sides civilians. Social media has been used to document the bloody conflict -- but it has also been a hotbed of misinformation. Swipe to see some of the claims we have debunked.

UPDATE October 20, 2023 The Hamas-controlled interior ministry said several displaced people sheltering at the compound of the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church in Gaza City were killed and injured after an Israeli strike late Thursday.

Witnesses told AFP the strike appeared to have been aimed at a target close to the place of worship where many Gaza residents had taken refuge as the war raged in the Palestinian enclave.

Contacted by AFP, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets had hit a command and control centre involved in launching rockets and mortars toward Israel.

""As a result of the IDF strike, a wall of a church in the area was damaged,"" it said, adding ""we are aware of reports on casualties. The incident is under review"". 

Witnesses said the strike damaged the facade of the church and caused an adjacent building to collapse, adding that many injured people were evacuated to hospital.

Among the casualties is Reuters video journalist Issam Abdallah who was killed Friday while reporting live near the border in southern Lebanon. ‚Å†

Six other journalists were injured in the same strike including two each from Reuters, Al Jazeera and Agence France-Presse, or AFP. ‚Å†

A United Nations spokesperson said, ‚ÄúIf the situation continues to escalate, we will most likely see more such tragedies.‚Äù ‚Å†

More than 4,000 people on both sides have been killed since Hamas militants launched an October 7 attack in Israel. Twelve of those, including Abdallah, were journalists covering the attack and counter-offensive, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Of the cases the CPJ has documented so far, 10 journalists were Palestinian, one was Israeli and one Lebanese. The New York-based organization says at least two other reporters are missing. ‚Å†

instagram,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Monday that the day-long trip to the region will reaffirm America's support for one of its closest allies.

""He's coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region, and for the world, "" Blinken said, adding that ""the president will reaffirm the United States solidarity with Israel and our ironclad commitment to its security.""

White House National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that Biden will ""reaffirm our solidarity with Israel, and he will look forward to getting an update from Israeli officials about their strategy and the pace of their military operations. He'll certainly expert to hear from Israel what they believe they need to continue to defend their people, and so that we can continue to work with Congress to try to meet those needs.""

Biden is scheduled to talk with Israeli officials about the nearly 200 hostages that Hamas is believed to be holding in the Gaza Strip, and learn additional information about the situation and coordinate efforts to secure their release, Kirby said.

The president will also travel to Amman, Jordan, where he'll meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Jordan's King Abdullah, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. There, they'll discuss the humanitarian needs of Gaza's civilians.

""Innocent civilians are innocent civilians,"" Kirby said. ""And none of them, no matter what side of the line they live on, or how they call themselves or how they worship deserve to be victims of armed conflict. As I've said before, the number of appropriate civilian casualties is zero. And we have been nothing but consistent about that.""

The trip will be just one day long, but ""there's an awful lot on the agenda,"" Kirby said. ""Again, reiterating that Israel has the right to defend itself and to go after these Hamas terrorists, and that the United States will continue to support them.""

""I would remind that Hamas is deliberately putting innocent civilians at greater risk by setting up road blocks, not letting them move, putting up commanding control headquarters in tunnels underneath their homes and schools and hospitals.""",,121,"{'like_count': 115, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-17 07:44:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyffLMxgmYB/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391437498_217306304563255_7670919963043955348_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pEChPRU-vsIAX_Gx_vQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAEcDdxHKzhysq9PEiw6SmCXYZl5RWXToiaShd1XOAfBw&oe=6532FEED

Investigators said that 39-year-old #CarlMintz threatened violence in the city of #Dearborn, which has one of the highest populations of #Arab #Americans in the U.S.

The Dearborn Police Department stated in a press release that Mintz is facing one felony count of threat of terrorism and a misdemeanor count of malicious use of a telecommunications device.

Last Wednesday, investigators said they received an anonymous tip about a post that Mintz allegedly made on his Facebook page, threatening violence against Palestinian Americans.

The post allegedly made by Mintz read, ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Anyone in Metro Detroit area want to go to Dearborn & hunt Palestinians?‚Äù

Mintz was arrested on Thursday at his home near #FarmingtonHills. A magistrate judge ordered that Mintz be assigned a GPS tether device and be banned from possessing weapons and using the internet as part of his bond conditions.

Dearborn has one of the largest Arab American populations in the United States, making up approximately 42% of the city‚Äôs population.

instagram,"There are plenty of jobs that are dangerous, and journalism can be one of them.

We've already seen that during the horrific conflict between Hamas and Israel where journalists have been seriously injured and one killed.

But it's also happened closer to home.
The killing of five Australian newsmen in Balibo, East Timor on October 16th, 1975 was horrific. 

Two television teams, from Channels Seven and Nine were assigned to investigate what would ultimately be an invasion into East Timor by Indonesian soldiers, only to die before they could get their stories out.

The truth of what happened to them has taken years to uncover, because both Indonesian and Australian governments have kept much of what they know underwraps.

It is a shameful history that still today is mired in secrets and sins.

Tonight on @underinvestigationau we'll reveal the confidential files and peel back the layers that have covered the truth of what happened to five newsmen, murdered because they were doing their job.

instagram,"On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel's bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world's most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

""As scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.""

What is Peace and Conflict studies (PACS)? üìöüí≠

PACS is an interdisciplinary program that focuses on systemic, as well as grassroots, perspectives on organized violence, conflict resolution and the concept of peace. The programme covers questions such as: how does organized violence arise, how can violence be countered, what role do international organizations and civil society play in the work for peace both locally and globally?

These questions are not only interesting to discuss, but also extremely relevant in today's society. Both internationally and locally.

On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that officials in the EU are demanding that X respond to a formal probe under its Digital Services Act concerning the social media platform‚Äôs commitment to censoring certain types of content amid the war.

According to the report, the probe follows hard on the heels of a Tuesday letter from EU commissioner Thierry Breton to Musk in which he raised the alarm about ‚Äúmanifestly false or misleading information‚Äù allegedly being spread on X.

‚ÄúWe have, from qualified sources, reports about potentially illegal content circulating on your service despite flags from relevant authorities,‚Äù Breton wrote, calling for Musk to implement ‚Äúmitigation measures‚Äù to curb the content.

instagram,"It is easy to think that if you simply avoid the conflict in your relationship, it does not exist. This is actually a coping mechanism, typically stemming from earlier experiences of conflict that didn‚Äôt go well, avoidant attachment style, or childhood trauma, etc. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Some reasons we may avoid conflict may include: people-pleasing, fear of abandonment , personal insecurities, fear of the relationship ending, not knowing how to communicate when someone is upset with you, etc. Because we enter new relationships carrying the wounds of our past, it is always a good idea to consider individual therapy to heal these wounds so we show up as our best selves to our partner. The goal is not to be perfect, but to understand why we may have stronger reactions to certain situations and how to cope with these reactions. ‚Å†
‚Å†
If you are someone who experienced trauma and find that it negatively affects your relationship, do not feel like you are doomed. Sometimes our deepest need in our romantic relationship is what we didn‚Äôt get as children. So our romantic relationships can be a portal into healing traumas. üíö‚Å†

instagram,"Anne Michaels is a new discovery for me but I have so enjoyed spending time with this gracious, affecting prose, and these novels of conflict and longing, love and grief, trauma and resilience. In Held, we meet John as he lies wounded on the battlefields of northern France, disorientated and occupying that hazy space between conscience and imagination. As we follow him over many decades, we see how the ghosts of that moment continue to linger, making their presence felt before retreating, and again, and again. This is top-class literary writing, radiant and profound. Thank you @bloomsburypublishing for the proof.

instagram,"""I have tried to give a voice through art to the tragic events involving journalists in the course of armed conflicts. I did it for the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, and since yesterday, I have started doing it for the ongoing conflict. The @committeetoprotectjournalists is investigating all cases of journalists killed, injured, detained, or missing. The situation is particularly critical for journalists in #Gaza, tasked with documenting the conflict despite the high risks posed by Israeli troop incursions, devastating Israeli airstrikes, disrupted communications, and prolonged power outages.

As of October 16, at least 12 journalists have been reported as victims of the conflict, with over 4,000 deaths on both sides since October 7, the start of the conflict. The list includes 10 Palestinian journalists, one Israeli, and one Lebanese. Eight other journalists are reported as injured, while three are reported as missing or detained. CPJ is also investigating reports of threats to journalists and damage to various media offices.

Sherif Mansour, the Coordinator of CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program, emphasizes that journalists are civilians engaged in crucial work during crises and should not be targeted by conflicting factions. Mansour highlights that their work requires significant sacrifices, and all involved parties must take measures to ensure their safety.

The list published by CPJ, based on information from the region and media reports, includes the names of the involved journalists. However, it is not always clear whether they were covering the conflict at the time of their death. CPJ continues to regularly update the list as it investigates the circumstances of individual cases.""",,102,"{'like_count': 101, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 284225}",Gianluca Costantini,,2023-10-17 06:29:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/320840149_536100618230998_5160289622778894386_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=c4ThtioAWywAX-vKzjm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAKyxb0ui9_o3L5xc2yTIDYglmb9xQLxQxzcFAZz9EGow&oe=6559B240,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyfWmhZo-SR/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393277709_1545663682635368_2266625647646322062_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9x-xWrOcmB0AX-Tf-kc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCDPZrmgRMm66qqPo2egieQ4US06uk1vfpNB-mwHM9zvw&oe=65417367
instagram,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) is continuing his effort to become the next speaker of the House of Representatives, with a full vote in the House for speaker expected on Tuesday at 12 p.m. ET.

Key Details: Sources close to Jordan say they are 15 to 19 votes short of the needed 217 after reportedly picking up about 30 to 50 votes over the weekend. Others say the gap is bigger than that for Jordan. 

Key Quote: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get past this stage,‚Äù said Congressman Frank Lucas (R-OK) about the debate over the House speaker. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not enough political oxygen in this place to think about other stuff.‚Äù

For Context: On Friday, House Republicans voted 124-81 to nominate Jordan for speaker but remained divided, with only 152 Republicans saying they would vote for Jordan on the House floor. The House has gone nearly two weeks without a speaker after ousting Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).

How the Media Covered it: Some left-rated sources focused on the fact that Jordan's election as speaker could trigger renewed conflict with House Democrats over the scope and size of government. Some right-rated outlets reported that while some think the vote will be close, others believe that a public vote will put pressure on House Republicans to support Jordan.

The work is about the impacts of intergenerational trauma on me and my family -- something I am continually trying to heal, and that we're now seeing play out again on a large scale -- cycles of violence that continue through the generations, in every conflict. At its core, the show is about trying to prevent trauma from passing down to the next generation.

instagram,"''The reality is that the world has been torn apart by this corrosive, selfish ambition of states couched in nationalistic terms or as patriotism but nonetheless most of the distortions of the last three centuries and even earlier have persisted. It is a throw-back to the selfish nature of man. Netanyahu, Mohammed Deif and all the other leaders involved in the current conflict claim that they are fighting for their own people‚Äôs interests. In doing so, they and their allies are not too keen about the humanity of others...

..the government of the day [NIG] has been busy announcing palliatives and loans, up to about N3. 27 trillion that would be used to alleviate the suffering that has descended heavily on the land: as follows: N200 billion to boost agriculture, N75bn for manufacturers, N125 bn for MSMEs and the informal sector, N185 billion as palliatives for states, N1 trillion as student loans, N315 billion to pay federal workers allowances for six months, N1. 13 trillion to 15 million households at N25, 000 for 3 months, N100 billion to acquire 3, 000 units of 20-seater CNG fuelled buses, N70 billion as palliative for lawmakers, N75 billion loan for market women‚Ä¶ and so on. The way this Nigerian government has been announcing a spending spree of billions since June 2023 is frightening. Wale Edun, the Co-ordinating Minister of the Economy has said the country will no longer rely on Ways and Means. So where is the money to run the economy and fund wastage and leakages coming from? Even the IMF/World Bank, at their recent Annual Summit in Marrakech, Morocco while praising recent reforms in Nigeria have said openly that the Naira is under pressure, with inflation at 26% year on year, and while reviewing Nigeria‚Äôs growth projection downwards, advised that Nigeria has to tighten monetary policy and address its foreign exchange to build trust and confidence. IMF says it is willing to lend Nigeria money if it is approached by Nigerian authorities. May we not end up like Sri Lanka and Venezuela. And Ghana next door.''

Yesterday, while sitting in peaceful Palm Beach, I couldn't help but overhear a group of older men discussing their fears of being unable to return to Europe due to their Jewish heritage. It was heartbreaking to witness their dreams being shattered and their plans being altered. My heart aches for the innocent lives lost in this conflict and the alarming rise of anti-Semitic sentiments and actions worldwide. üíîüåé

Today, I want to extend my love and prayers to all families experiencing pain and danger.

instagram,"Have you ever had an authority figure tell you: ‚ÄúDo as I say, not as I do?‚Äù You lose a bit of respect for them after that, don‚Äôt you? They may even seem like a hypocrite if they aren‚Äôt living by the rules they‚Äôre giving.

For FOCUSED member and now ADHD coach, Natalie, this internal conflict led her to a big life change that you might not expect. She quit recreational marijuana use. But it wasn‚Äôt fellow smoking clients that led her to this decision. 

It was the fact that she was coaching vulnerability and asking people to open up and make bold changes in their lives to move forward and achieve their potential when she herself felt like she wouldn‚Äôt and couldn‚Äôt give up this one thing that she was desperately dependent on to feel good.

This week‚Äôs episode of I Have ADHD takes a unique perspective on cannabis use for adults with ADHD - one of honesty, no judgment, and a straightforward look at the pros and cons that the effects of this plant had on someone many of us can relate to.

I hope you listen in on this one and can walk away with these key messages:
The pain, stress, or tension you may feel is real and valid, and you are deserving of relief. It may even come in the form of cannabis.

For those of us with ADHD, we need to be mindful that we are more susceptible to substance use, abuse, and addiction. And when our mental health struggles are left undiagnosed, untreated, and/or unmedicated, we will inevitably find something to help us feel better as fast as possible. 

Numbing emotions or avoiding feelings is not a healthy way to deal with ADHD, no matter how tempting it may be to turn all the noise down in our heads and feel like our neurotypical friends for a minute.

Tune in to Natalie‚Äôs story, and I welcome your thoughts and personal experiences on this topic as we all strive towards health and wholeness living with ADHD.

Synopsis:

Sometimes unexpected paths lead to the best destinations.‚Ä®‚Ä®Highly sought after conflict photographer, relationship-averse Marley Cunningham thrives on adrenaline and the chaos of her nomadic life. But when the passion for her career starts to wane, she decides a hike far from the noise of life is the best way to shake the doubts from her mind and focus on what she wants. Spraining her ankle and being rescued by a handsome stranger and his pack of dogs is not part of the plan.
Big-hearted, reclusive Bennett Morgan has spent his life with two main goals, play professional football for a few years and then pursue medicine. Shortly after his football career begins, a catastrophic diagnosis shatters both goals in one fell swoop. Feeling lost for the first time, he packs up his life and two dogs and returns to the home he couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. It‚Äôs in the shadow of his past that he finds joy in starting a dog sanctuary.
After a rainstorm washes away the road to Bennett‚Äôs home, he is shocked to find Marley injured and alone on the secluded trail he walks the dogs on daily. From the moment she is hoisted onto his back, Marley is drawn in by Bennett‚Äôs kindness, strength and calm nature. Bennett quickly realizes that a bit more human connection in his life might not be such a bad thing, especially when that human is beautiful, courageous, complicated, Marley.
Through the patience and care of Bennett, Marley begins to explore her feelings for not just her career but to her shock, the man who rescued her. Bennett, on the other hand, must decide if embracing the present with Marley is worth it, even if the future is uncertain.

instagram,"October 17, 2023,

I write with a heavy heart about the latest, deadly escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I share my deepest condolences for those who have lost loved ones and are traumatized by Hamas‚Äôs recent attacks on Israeli civilians, with over 1,400 people killed including children. I am moved by the powerful words of survivors like Noi Katzman whose brother Chaim was killed in the attacks and said: ‚ÄúThe most important thing for me and also for my brother, is that his death will not be used as a justification for killing innocent people.‚Äù (1)

I also grieve alongside those families who have lost loved ones in Palestine, with Israeli aerial bombardment killing to date more than 4,200 people including over 1,000 children and the spiraling humanitarian catastrophe. We must prioritize shared human dignity and empathy for all at risk in this conflict, especially children. I call upon President Biden and Secretary Blinken to listen to Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations and to work with Israel‚Äôs government to ensure the release of hostages and pursuit of those culpable for the Hamas attacks without engaging in collective punishment and the killing of Palestinian civilians. (2) (3)

Constituents throughout the 16th Legislative District and the State of New Jersey are in mourning and we all must join to support one another through these heartbreaking times. Israelis and Palestinians deserve to live in peace and safety as do all the diverse communities in New Jersey. As a mother, I implore all parties to focus on our common humanity to heal and build the peaceful world our children deserve.

Sincerely,

ASSEMBLYWOMAN SADAF F. JAFFER

instagram,"The situation in Gaza right now is as close to Hell as many of us could imagine. The evacuation of hospitals, critical utilities cut off, an enforced exodus to the south of the region and more dead and dying as a result of the most horrendous conflict in one of the most densely populated areas is hard to comprehend. 

The murder and mayhem visited on communities in Gaza and southern Israel must come to an end. The cycle of violence has to stop. The politics of force and violence can never secure a lasting peace. Violence inflicted on civilians, of the kind we‚Äôve seen this last week, is like a virus that affects and infects a society for generations. The only cure is the relentless pursuit of dialogue and peace between people even with the most historic enmity.

What is needed right now, and is deliverable by those involved in this appalling conflict, is an immediate ceasefire to establish humanitarian aid corridors for those trapped in what is effectively an open-air prison. The release of hostages held in more frightening circumstances than any of us could imagine. And a commitment from the international community to work intensively for peace based on a two-state solution.",,88,"{'like_count': 88, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 4165}",Colum Eastwood,,2023-10-17 09:54:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/354518713_281892977734177_8890414899066075877_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0swaj72B5SQAX_AWHy7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfASrNe1HzGQZm_bjR2jYF5HYr4M4lAZ6AW7rktYJ_UMnQ&oe=655A5152,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyfuH5zIGTW/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/358195947_3639192396322398_290772204790669526_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=O0QnrPFZMs0AX-yGTik&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBBY39AQcSKCCPohcP3Xfo7WznoYApiGmCkdUoimRNEaQ&oe=655AD20C
instagram,"What are the chances of being torn to pieces by a crocodile in northern Australia? üêä

Saltwater crocodile expert and @ourANU PhD scholar Yusuke Fukuda says that most years there have been one or two fatal crocodile attacks in Queensland and the Northern Territory combined.

A spooky thing about saltwater crocodiles is that you can‚Äôt trust your senses that you‚Äôll see or hear a croc: they are experts at hiding under the water‚Äôs surface.

‚ÄúWater that is just two feet deep is enough for a four-metre crocodile to hide from you,‚Äù says Yusuke.

‚ÄúEven if he's only two metres away from your feet, you won‚Äôt see him.‚Äù

That‚Äôs why public education is key for human-crocodile conflict management in Australia.

instagram,"Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.
On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.
‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.‚Äù

Everyone is on edge, but we can‚Äôt let that take us out of our humanity.

We can‚Äôt let our anger get the better of us.

instagram,"This past weekend, I was on a panel with @sarahdarerlitt, Jenny Lussier - the @ctcasl president, and Susan Campbell to discuss book banning in CT. We were really pleased with the amount of people who showed up, and it was a great convo. There was one main takeaway we wanted attendees to remember: it‚Äòs vital to attend your local school and library board meetings, especially whenever you hear a book is being challenged in your district, to voice your dissent. Right now the few individuals that want to take books off shelves have the loudest voices in these meetings, so we need to show up and speak up for the freedom to read.üó£Ô∏è

Another easy way to help is to ask your school and library boards what their policies are when a book is challenged. If they do not currently have a policy, push them to create one. With elections coming up, now‚Äôs also a good time to reach out to your local school board and state govt candidates to learn their stance on this issue. Then vote accordingly! üó≥Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre in CT, there‚Äôs an opportunity this Saturday to stand against banning books. Moms for Liberty, the conservative group that‚Äôs been pushing for book banning, is having a symposium in Avon, CT. A rally will take place outside to protest their work‚Äîat the Avon Senior Center at noon this Saturday 10/21. I unfortunately have a conflict but I will be supporting from afar.

instagram,"Cosmic Weather Forecast for Oct 17th
For my witches, conjurers, alchemists and other spiritual practitioners making magick happen, here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs Cosmic Weather Report to discuss how the seasonal and astrological elements can impact your spellwork.
‚Äå
Join me as I pull oracle cards and discuss spellwork for Libra season.
‚Äå
Libra is an Air sign, ruled by Venus, and is represented by the scales; a symbol of justice and balance, Libra is the only sign of the zodiac not depicted by an animal or person.
‚Äå
In Greek mythology Libra is related to the Greek Goddess of Justice, Themis, whose daughter, Astraea went up to heaven and became the constellation of Virgo.
‚Äå
As the goddess of justice, Themis is usually seen as a woman who is blindfolded and holding the scale in her hands, with which she weighed up the rights and wrongs of any dispute.
‚Äå
When her wishes or advice were ignored, Themis called in her fellow goddess, Nemesis, whose name, in Greek, means ‚Äòto give what is due‚Äô, to punish those who dared to disobey the gods, they made a good team; Themis made the laws and Nemesis ensured they were not broken.
‚Äå
As Libra is ruled by Venus, energies around beauty, creativity, harmony, and romance are present.
‚Äå
Energetic themes present during Libra season are:
‚öñÔ∏è Clarity, Conversation, and Communication
‚öñÔ∏è Romance, Relationships, and Social Bonds
‚öñÔ∏è Creativity, Harmony, and Balance
‚öñÔ∏è Legal Work, Justice, and Conflict Resolution
‚Äå
If you are interested in using Libra energies in your spellwork, the featured masterclasses in this month‚Äôs Libra Masterclass drop are:

instagram,"Analysis of the Current Situation:

The U.S. and Israel had foreknowledge of this massacre but didn't intervene to prevent it.

Israel's military (Mossad) actions led to a mass casualty and refugee crisis by targeting densely populated areas.

Despite expressing concern for refugees, Israel voted against a humanitarian ceasefire.

Israel proposed a solution after creating the problem that would concentrate the people they seek to genocide into a small area. 

Where they would control the food water and medical care.

Expressing any opinion other than unwavering support for Israel you get called an antisemite.

Don't Feel Pressured to Choose Sides:

Reject the pressure to take sides in a crisis created by zionists.

The true victims are innocent civilians on both sides and American taxpayers.

Winners and Losers:

The defense industry and certain politicians benefit, while civilians suffer and die.

Suffering of Innocent People: 

The main victims are civilians who have lost their homes and livelihoods.

Opposition to Violence:

Both Hamas and the Cartels are widely recognized as terrorist organizations.

What the fake media forgets to mention that zionists created Hamas to give reason to destroy Palestinian life and create a world war. 

It's essential to focus on supporting the people affected in both situations.

Notably, while the U.S. faces issues like lethal Fentanyl from cartels, it doesn't lead to bombing Mexican cities.

This situation is Zionism.

Call for Accountability:

The individuals behind this crisis, as well as those propagating it, should face international trial and public scrutiny.

Trials should be live for ALL to see. Their crimes shown to the public and punishment should be death penalty for treason sedition crimes against humanity crimes against children. 

Potential Distraction:

This conflict may serve as a distraction from other issues, diverting attention from different matters.

instagram,"T√ºrkiye's foreign minister has put forth a proposal for a guarantor system in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing Ankara's central role in shaping the idea.

Addressing reporters in an exclusive press briefing at the Foreign Ministry in the capital, Hakan Fidan emphasized the need for multiple countries including T√ºrkiye to act as guarantors once both parties reach an agreement, with the responsibility to ensure its implementation.

Fidan also emphasized the importance of international pressure on Israel to adopt a two-state solution, saying T√ºrkiye shared its views on this issue with the parties.

Discussions held between the Turkish foreign minister and the US revealed that the Biden administration was also supportive of a two-state solution.

instagram,"Step into the captivating world of the 1851 Agidingbi Battle Crest, where history and symbolism intertwine to tell a fascinating tale. This emblem is a veritable treasure trove of heritage, offering a glimpse into the rich tapestry of Lagos.

To the left, stands the majestic Royal Eben, a symbol of traditional authority that reigns over Lagos. On the right, we have the Lagos Mace adorned with the State Coat of Arms, a representation of the governance that shapes the destiny of Lagos State.

Nestled on the badge is the royal cap of the idejo Chiefs, the true custodians of Lagos' land. These dignitaries have watched over the city's heritage for generations.

The four-part Crest unfolds like a meticulously crafted narrative. The Eyo, introduced in Lagos on February 20, 1854, commemorates the funeral of Oba Akitoye, a central figure in the 1851 Bombardment of Lagos Narrative. A story of courage, conflict, and change.

Beside it stands the notorious HMS Bloodhound, the British warship that left an indelible mark on Lagos in 1851, forever etched in history.

Descending to the left, you'll find the royal sword of Lagos, wielded by heroes like Oshodi Tapa, who fought valiantly to defend the city with their lives. A symbol of unwavering loyalty and bravery.

On the right, a reminder of the past - the cannon guns that gave birth to the name ""Agidingbi."" a living echo, resounds from the onomatopoeic sounds produced by the artillery guns fired by British forces during the 1851 invasion of Lagos.

Underneath the crest, a fascinating mosaic of meaning unfolds. Cowries, reminiscent of trade and prosperity, intermingle with the  Akoko leaves , a symbol of obaship and the enduring authority of the Lagos throne.

And lastly, the ropes of unity and the chessboard, tying together the diverse threads of Lagos' history into a harmonious tapestry of identity and heritage.

Join us at the official launch on the 28th of October, 2023, at the Red Door Gallery, 51B Bishop Oluwole V.I.

October 9th was Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Day and I didn‚Äôt have a chance to share this because I took the day to be with my daughter.

With the ongoing conflict in Jerusalem, I am reminded of the genocide against peoples indigenous to what is now America, Mexico, and El Salvador, as these are the histories I am thoroughly familiar with.

I stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine as I stand with all peoples living under oppression.

instagram,"Edit: The IDF is now saying it was an errant rocket fired from Gaza by Hamas. That's certainly possible I guess, despite what every news outlet initially reported. But a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted, considering they have lied in the past about stuff like this, like when they said Palestinians killed Shireen Abu Akleh. Also 11 total hospitals have been hit since this started, you mean to tell me ALL of them have been from errant rockets? I have never seen a rocket from Gaza that had quite that much explosive power.

 Either fucking way, horrific justification, and horrible thing to happen right now to people who had nothing to do with any of this war and were sheltering in place. Fog of War is certainly a possibility.

This is legit one of the most evil things I have ever seen a government do in my entire lifetime. Just imagine you are a sick person in a hospital, having nothing to do with this war or conflict and a bomb drops on your hospital bed, killing you and 499 fellow patients and doctors. 

This is not some terrorist group or an insurgent organization This is the most powerful military in the middle east, backed by the most powerful military in the world, committing an unspeakable war crime on people who have no way of fighting back. 

I don't care if this gets me cancelled THIS IS GENOCIDE AND I WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY. Especially in the face of complete censorship and oppression to anyone who dares criticize Israel or else they will be labeled an anti-semite. I can think of nothing more anti-semitic than equating the Israeli government, the IDF, Likud, and/or Zionism with Judaism. 

Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli lives in the eyes of most people, and this is the result. Utter fucking barbarity and dehumanization that does absolutely NOTHING for the families of the people who were lost in the October 7 attack. Did we learn fucking NOTHING from 9/11?

First day of my periods since finding cycle syncing now looks like THISüëÜüèª. This is from last year on a mastermind retreat. Feeling confident enough to snap sexy photos on the beach in Mexico. Being able to dually socialize while also prioritizing my self care. Having stable AF energy and emotions.

Let it be known ladies: YOURE ONLY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE. your potential, success and balance in life is made exponentially better when you incorporate your cycle into your life. Are you ready for it?!
