facebook,"October 18, 2023 (Wednesday) President Joe Biden spoke today in Tel Aviv, Israel, reiterating support for the Israelis but also hammering on the need to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Biden called the actions of Hamas ‚Äúpure unadulterated evil‚Äù and noted that such brutality ‚Äúwould have cut deep anywhere in the world, but it cuts deeper here in Israel.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe attack,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhas brought to the surface painful memories and scars left by‚Ä¶millennia of antisemitism and the genocide of the Jewish people.‚Äù In the past, he said, the world watched and did nothing, but ‚Äú[w]e will not stand by and do nothing again. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.‚Äù Biden promised the U.S. is working to recover the hostages, and he empathized with those who had lost loved ones. He promised that Israel would always be a safe home for the Jewish people. He promised military aid and once again warned ‚Äúany state or any other hostile actor thinking about attacking Israel‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt.‚Äù But in a statement that spoke to the Arab world, Biden also warned Israel not to give into the ‚Äúprimal feeling‚Äù of ‚Äú[s]hock, pain,‚Ä¶ an all-consuming rage.‚Äù ‚ÄúI caution this,‚Äù he said: ‚ÄúWhile you feel that rage, don‚Äôt be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.‚Äù Biden also appeared to speak to the administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he spoke about what it means to be a war leader. ‚Äú[I]t requires being deliberate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt requires asking very hard questions. It requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you are on will achieve those objectives.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people.‚Äù Biden reiterated that Hamas uses families in Gaza as human shields, putting command centers, weapons, and communications tunnels in residential areas. ‚ÄúThe Palestinian people are suffering greatly as well,‚Äù Biden said. And then he took on the issue of yesterday‚Äôs explosion at the hospital in Gaza, expressing outrage and sadness. And then he clarified what had happened in that explosion: ‚ÄúBased on the information we‚Äôve seen to date, it appears the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza.‚Äù This statement reflects the assessment of the U.S. Defense Department and was echoed today by the Senate Intelligence Committee, with a Democratic majority, and the House Intelligence Committee, with a Republican majority. ‚ÄúWhile we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,‚Äù White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said today. Biden went on to explain that the United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict‚Äîa key tenet of the laws of war‚Äîand said ‚ÄúI grieve‚ÄîI truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe people of Gaza need food, water, medicine, shelter,‚Äù Biden said, adding that he had asked the Israeli cabinet to agree to the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. He said that Israel has agreed, based on the promise that the aid would go to civilians. Should Hamas divert or steal that aid, he said, access will stop and Hamas ‚Äúwill have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people.‚Äù Biden said the U.S. is working closely with Egypt and the United Nations to get trucks moving across the border as quickly as possible. It is also demanding that the International Red Cross be able to visit Hamas‚Äôs hostages. Biden also announced that the U.S. will dedicate $100 million in new funding for humanitarian assistance in Gaza and the West Bank to help the more than 1 million displaced Palestinians. Biden urged Israelis to remember that their state is a democracy. It must live not by the rules of terrorists, but by the rule of law. ‚ÄúWhat sets us apart from the terrorists is we believe in the fundamental dignity of every human life‚ÄîIsraeli, Palestinian, Arab, Jew, Muslim, Christian‚Äîeveryone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt give up what makes you who you are. If you give that up, then the terrorists win. And we can never let them win.‚Äù ‚ÄúNations of conscience like the United States and Israel are not measured solely by the example of their power,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre measured by the power of our example. That‚Äôs why, as hard as it is, we must keep pursuing peace.

facebook,"Obeying Jesus‚Äô command taught me several powerful truths we experience when we pray for people who have hurt us: 1. Prayer shields our hearts from bitterness. It gives us a verbal outlet for our pain, a way to begin releasing our resentment to God. It prevents righteous anger and real hurt from twisting into damaging bitterness. 2. Prayer humbles us. It reminds us that even when we have been hurt, we are imperfect and need grace too. It may even help us to consider the conflict from the other person‚Äôs perspective. 3. Prayer helps us resist the temptation to seek revenge. It reminds us that God loves justice and that we can trust Him to defend and protect us. 4. Prayer gives us peace while we wait for resolution. Praying strengthens our relationship with God during our relational conflict. We trust that God is working even when we can‚Äôt see or understand all He is doing. If you‚Äôre embroiled in a conflict, wrestling with bitterness, or feeling hurt or confused by a strained relationship, Jesus‚Äô encouragement to pray for your enemy may provide the protection your heart needs. You can pray about your situation, and pray for the person with whom you are in conflict, every day ‚Äî even multiple times a day. Feeling wounded by a friend‚Äôs refusal to accept your apology? You can pray about that. Feeling afraid she may hurt more people if she doesn‚Äôt change? You can pray about that. Longing to attempt reconciliation but not sure the other person will even speak to you? You can pray about that. We can pray about all of it. God welcomes our requests, and He longs to help His children find forgiveness and unity (John 17:20-23). It takes time, but when we commit to persistently praying for those who offend us, we give God the chance to work on their hearts ‚Äî and ours. -Elizabeth Laing Thompson, Writer How has prayer protected your heart when you‚Äôve been hurt?",,13420,"{'like_count': 4015, 'comment_count': 237, 'num_users': 4088959}",Proverbs 31 Ministries,,2023-10-19 13:00:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/299230693_611207197041265_9112818105765092683_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LOH7swUmMJMAX_4hjUj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAbiy8FOt8xUJPVg8kBYFRDj3m7dxKrP0xMDJ8l4TxqSA&oe=655A082B,https://www.facebook.com/100044559694018/posts/870648154430500,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393783640_870648137763835_3845368024880330043_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=WWkAfnjK2W8AX8G50Cm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD4WbbpQ-f0t9JpXhGaqiZ3jCM7qRR5BFr2h8FEu277mQ&oe=655ACDD2

facebook,"ùë∫ùíïùíêùíçùíÜùíè ùë¥ùíêùíéùíÜùíèùíïùíî ‚ô§03 The following morning Cheludo was up before the sun could come down, she had a crime show on TV as she continued going through his file with a candle by her table. How did he do that? Come up with that because she was smart, she could admit that but him? How high was his IQ? She paged to the first page, she didn't remember seeing that. How come there nothing in reference to him as a person. His family history and everything? The candle went out and she was left in the dark with knly the tv screen and the voices filling the void. She chuckled. There no Tumelo here. She got chills even thinking of what he did to that man in a dark room just like this and the world outside had no idea. She didn't want to take this case. She really didn't but as soon as she got her nausea down and started looking at it like the proper psychologist she was, Tumelo was‚Ä¶interesting. She sat in the room in silence as the sun started to rise at half five, a little light shedding into her house‚Ä¶.the ambience bringing about peace. As she sat there, she had no idea it was the only time she'd find that kind of peace in her life. With a little smile, she stretched her body, a yawn escaping her plump lips and she chuckled. ""Hello new day and new challenges."" This wasn't going to be a long one. Probably two to three months if she now starts doing her research on criminal minds. She'd get the hang of it or‚Ä¶ She was starting to have ideas on how to psychoanalysis him and maybe this was a sign that she should take the case. With a little spring in her step, she left the file on her table yet again and walked to her bathroom to get ready for work. An hour later, she was by the mirror, tying her braids into a big bun as she applied lip gloss on her lips. She looked at her pumps and she thought about Julie's comment. She can't wear anything else. Pumps were comfortable and heels made her toes ache, sneakers weren't professional and she couldn't risk not being called professional. She changed the pair of pumps she wore to another new pair, she had been keeping it in her closet for some time. At least her problems didn't include viruses that she had to carry for life. She caught her train of thoughts. ""Cheludo!"" That was insensitive of her, Julie is going through a lot and she should be considerate of her friend, speaking of said friend‚Ä¶ She picked up her phone to call her. ""Hello?"" ""Morning Julie, how are you feeling? I got a bit carried away with work yesterday and I couldn't call."" ""It still feels like I'm dreaming.."" Cheludo sympathised with Julie. She really did. ""Have you booked an appointment with a counsellor or a therapist?"" ""How about you?"" ""No. Conflict of interest, I can recommend good ones."" ""I don't want everyone to know I got herpes. It's already flaring up at the moment and makes everything uncomfortable."" ""Sorry tlhemma. Did you ask him?"" Julie laughed with tears in her eyes. ""He says he wasn't forced to disclose it to me and I'm being dramatic. I want to cry so bad and it hurts because it feels like life is-"" ""Life is not over and I'll keep on repeating that."" ""Okay."" ""I have to go to work, I'll call you later okay?"" ""Okay. Thank you and bye."" ""Bye."" She cut the call and picked her cheap signature stores perfume to spray it on her clothes and around herself. She was set for the day. *** At Cheludo's workplace, the first she did was head to her boss' office. She knocked lightly until she was given the go ahead to come in. She smiled at her boss who placed her coffee mug down. Her boss was hoping that Cheludo took the case. That would mean the government was going to pay a lot of money to their practice and since it wasn't a very well known practice, it would be asy to conceal that a man like Tumelo, a dangerous man is being assessed. Even Tumelo's court case wasn't publicised. No one knew anything and that wa show secretive the government was. ""I hope you have good news for me."" That was even before Cheludo took her seat. She smoothed down her skirt as she finally took her seat, hands placed neatly on her lap and her soft smile on her face. ""I'm taking on the case."" ""Thank God. You won't regret this."" She nodded. ""You'll have to sign an NDA and a few things before we proceed. No one has to know about this. Not even your colleagues. No one."" Cheludo's smile wavered. It was that serious? ""Tumelo's fate is in your hands Cheludo and the government is banking on you."" She swallowed now, the enormity of what she was about ro do settling on her. ""You are a psychologist and you about to deal with one sick mad man and you also need the psychotherapy you can get. When it gets to heavy, I'll be here to assist.""

Some people cannot stay out of conflict or trouble. Every time you turn around, they are in a squabble or fight with someone else. If you help them get out of one mess, they quickly get into another. They have hot tempers and unruled spirits, so there is no hope for them. They will have a life of trouble, ruin their relationships, and then die lonely. The lessons are simple. First, if you do not rule your anger, God and men will punish you for your temper. A wise man will confess his angry spirit, beg God to help him, and obey the proverbs about anger. Second, if you help a person with a bad temper, you will be helping him again next month, for he cannot learn to get along with others. His selfish spirit and hot temper will explode again against some little offence, real or perceived. Neither anger nor a temper is noble. It is not a sign of manliness or authority. It is not the evidence of a strong man ‚Äì it is the proof of a weak fool (Eccl 7:9). A great man rules his spirit and controls his anger; fools are ruled by their spirits and controlled by their anger. Wrath is blinding and binding, so that helping a quick-tempered man out of trouble caused by his anger will not protect him for long; he will sin again by anger very soon. Wrath is violent anger. It is the emotional volcano that erupts in a fool‚Äôs heart when he is offended or does not get his way. It is a terrible evil. It leads to many sins of thought, speech, and action. Jesus knew it was at the root of murder, so He condemned unjustified anger as murder in God‚Äôs sight (Matt 5:21-22). A man with a temper will be guilty of many sins (Pr 10:12; 12:16; 14:17; 15:18; 17:19; 22:24-25; 26:21; 29:22; 30:33). If a man has not learned to rule his spirit, you must rescue him over and over again from the trouble his anger causes (Pr 27:3). He is a burden to deal with, because you must be constantly covering or correcting his foolish passions. Delivering him today from a mess his anger caused will not help you tomorrow ‚Äì he will do it again. A wise man avoids angry men, because they are mostly trouble as friends (Pr 13:20; 21:24; 22:24-25; 29:22). Learn to hate anger, for it is unmanageable (Pr 27:3-4). It is a work of your sinful flesh and old man, not the new man of a child of God (Eph 4:31; Col 3:8). Slow your passions down, especially anger (Pr 16:32). Glorious men postpone anger (Pr 19:11). Only fools let it fly (Ec 7:9). Learn to get over anger quickly and end conflicts, for unresolved anger gives place to the devil (Eph 4:26-27). Exalt mercy instead (Pr 3:3; 21:3; Micah 6:8). Learn to love, which is God‚Äôs greatest grace toward you, and the greatest grace you can show others (I Cor 13:4-7,13). It is the greatest evidence of eternal life and God‚Äôs presence in your life. Love teaches and empowers you to bear, endure, and suffer for a long time; it teaches you to not be easily provoked. God is love. Do you know God (I John 4:7-8,16)? If you know God, you will show love rather than anger to others in life. https://letgodbetrue.com/proverbs/index/chapter-19/proverbs-19-19/",,10797,"{'like_count': 7174, 'comment_count': 317, 'num_users': 312690}",Wisdom of Solomon's Proverbs,,2023-10-19 04:00:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/306608144_5607006769346984_2940758302796135087_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=KnKfxu88W4MAX-VVPZQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB278PnzyFyfsRe0255CF55FXG9B3ARBcFr3EhC7yGy_Q&oe=6559B90D,https://www.facebook.com/100064650671332/posts/709913841173632,

Her parents died in a car accident when she was only five, and Claire was adopted by her uncle, Quentin Lambert Beauchamp, an archaeologist and historian whose work took him all over the world. He attempted to enroll her at an English boarding school, but she stubbornly refused to attend. ""Faced with the necessity of prying my chubby fingers off the car's door handle and dragging me by the heels up the steps of the school, Uncle Lamb, who hated personal conflict of any kind, had sighed in exasperation, then finally shrugged and tossed his better judgment out the window along with my newly purchased round straw boater."" Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser was a nurse, later a doctor, and a time-traveler who has lived both in the 20th century and the 18th century. While on a second honeymoon in Scotland with her husband, Frank Randall, Claire inadvertently travels two hundred years into the past, where she meets and eventually [marries the love of her life] Jamie Fraser.

Today, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi met with General Michael Kurilla, Commander, U.S. Central Command. The meeting was also attended by Minister of Defense and Military Production General Mohamed Zaki. The Spokesman for the Presidency said both sides stressed keenness to strengthen the strategic partnership between Egypt and the United States and to intensify the ongoing cooperation and coordination in various fields, especially military and security, in light of their importance to support efforts to restore security and stability and consolidate peace in the Middle East. The meeting reviewed a number of issues of common interest, particularly the developments in the Gaza Strip. The President outlined Egypt‚Äôs efforts for de-escalation, stressing the importance of the international community' concerted efforts to contain the crisis and stop its escalation in dangerous directions, and shifting to the approach of reviving the peace path based on the solution of two states that live side by side in peace and security, taking into account the danger of the security consequences of this conflict from extending to the entire region. The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip was also discussed. President El-Sisi stressed the importance of continuing to deliver humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people in the Strip in a sustainable manner, as a top priority, in light of the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the Strip.",,8065,"{'like_count': 5484, 'comment_count': 737, 'num_users': 2379927}",ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ÿ≠ÿØÿ´ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸÖŸä ŸÑÿ±ÿ¶ÿßÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖŸáŸàÿ±Ÿäÿ©-Spokesman for the Egyptian Presidency,,2023-10-19 09:02:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/328441906_909358313530689_6753333129130148843_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eHjJH8VKXdcAX8FFJ6b&_nc_oc=AQkz-ovPXPjNN9FGHjcE2gTOdWr2EhnAkTFzoZEb-dmM1r1g7Q6z08gVYdu6pv5O7YY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfChrQ0doEGmYFJpwy4OpzBVrRwPE-ylfgG3fOXqiAQVew&oe=6559EF70,https://www.facebook.com/100044362122571/posts/890067825815280,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393387841_890067782481951_1327517408489435967_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=dP9RI3AUM70AX83x9ww&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAdmlYuMcWTIvJX_0TKVMFl5YGZWePmNMuxFw6GZ7Aavw&oe=6536D35C

Some people cannot stay out of conflict or trouble. Every time you turn around, they are in a squabble or fight with someone else. If you help them get out of one mess, they quickly get into another. They have hot tempers and unruled spirits, so there is no hope for them. They will have a life of trouble, ruin their relationships, and then die lonely. The lessons are simple. First, if you do not rule your anger, God and men will punish you for your temper. A wise man will confess his angry spirit, beg God to help him, and obey the proverbs about anger. Second, if you help a person with a bad temper, you will be helping him again next month, for he cannot learn to get along with others. His selfish spirit and hot temper will explode again against some little offence, real or perceived. Neither anger nor a temper is noble. It is not a sign of manliness or authority. It is not the evidence of a strong man ‚Äì it is the proof of a weak fool (Eccl 7:9). A great man rules his spirit and controls his anger; fools are ruled by their spirits and controlled by their anger. Wrath is blinding and binding, so that helping a quick-tempered man out of trouble caused by his anger will not protect him for long; he will sin again by anger very soon. Wrath is violent anger. It is the emotional volcano that erupts in a fool‚Äôs heart when he is offended or does not get his way. It is a terrible evil. It leads to many sins of thought, speech, and action. Jesus knew it was at the root of murder, so He condemned unjustified anger as murder in God‚Äôs sight (Matt 5:21-22). A man with a temper will be guilty of many sins (Pr 10:12; 12:16; 14:17; 15:18; 17:19; 22:24-25; 26:21; 29:22; 30:33). If a man has not learned to rule his spirit, you must rescue him over and over again from the trouble his anger causes (Pr 27:3). He is a burden to deal with, because you must be constantly covering or correcting his foolish passions. Delivering him today from a mess his anger caused will not help you tomorrow ‚Äì he will do it again. A wise man avoids angry men, because they are mostly trouble as friends (Pr 13:20; 21:24; 22:24-25; 29:22). Learn to hate anger, for it is unmanageable (Pr 27:3-4). It is a work of your sinful flesh and old man, not the new man of a child of God (Eph 4:31; Col 3:8). Slow your passions down, especially anger (Pr 16:32). Glorious men postpone anger (Pr 19:11). Only fools let it fly (Ec 7:9). Learn to get over anger quickly and end conflicts, for unresolved anger gives place to the devil (Eph 4:26-27). Exalt mercy instead (Pr 3:3; 21:3; Micah 6:8). Learn to love, which is God‚Äôs greatest grace toward you, and the greatest grace you can show others (I Cor 13:4-7,13). It is the greatest evidence of eternal life and God‚Äôs presence in your life. Love teaches and empowers you to bear, endure, and suffer for a long time; it teaches you to not be easily provoked. God is love. Do you know God (I John 4:7-8,16)? If you know God, you will show love rather than anger to others in life. https://letgodbetrue.com/proverbs/index/chapter-19/proverbs-19-19/",,7828,"{'like_count': 7223, 'comment_count': 136, 'num_users': 16648}",Get Wisdom,,2023-10-19 04:00:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/369798917_283040497777513_3234535548688063928_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=BBMrDNYD-_sAX8nXq67&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBVZziTbXdIEvatK-FPP-yy7tIJ57foXSk5MtmvbQLEDQ&oe=655AAC76,https://www.facebook.com/100082146956568/posts/309452781802951,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393770213_309069401841289_1957831766069092872_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=vHQyF6KXtS8AX90iP0p&_nc_oc=AQk1ALsyKG-FWGQClaSm3fWpJn9dZnTPLz19UbR_Md-6xWHdDzkeV0HNOKIY5vTY2-Y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCmCRTedVWdVL1Xj1SeAqmLV5cfOC_-jj4a6yc3OFcmhQ&oe=654DFB05

Despite that incredible amount of time confined to a kennel, Marty continues to be the sweetest, most engaged boy. In the yard, he‚Äôs a lover. He prefers to spend his time in your arms receiving lots of affection. He‚Äôs been groomed and did well during bath time. He‚Äôs also been in playgroup with other large pups and has done well though he will sometimes jump in on other dogs‚Äô fights (conflict driven) so they recently started muzzling him. Heartbreakingly, Marty‚Äôs TIME IS UP üò¢ The shelter is full and he‚Äôs the next victim to land on the dreaded red list because kennels need to be cleared. He‚Äôs waited so patiently for someone to choose him, it would be devastating if he doesn‚Äôt get his happily ever after. Marty is available for ADOPTION or RESCUE. Marty is a strong boy who can be quite barrier reactive walking through the kennels, so a confident handler who can work on his reactivity is recommended.

facebook,"VICE ADMIRAL GAVAN IS THE 30TH PCG COMMANDANT üáµüá≠ Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Jaime Bautista announces the appointment of CG VICE ADMIRAL RONNIE GIL LATORILLA GAVAN as the 30th Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Commandant during the Change of Command Ceremony at the National Headquarters, Port Area, Manila, today, 19 October 2023. In his speech, the Transportation Secretary expressed his trust and confidence that CG Vice Admiral Gavan would efficiently lead the PCG in implementing the ""White Hull Approach"" towards upholding maritime security and safety in the country's exclusive economic zones. ""Admiral Art was hailed for his innate peace mindset that steered the country away from any deterioration in the volatile situation at the West Philippine Sea,"" DOTr Secretary Bautista said. ""My belief that Vice Admiral Ronnie Gavan will do the same is anchored on his record of shifting to the 'White Hull Approach' when securing our maritime borders and his introduction of female radio operators, called 'Angels of the Sea,' as a way of diffusing tension during sea conflict,"" he furthered. Moreover, the Transportation Secretary emphasized President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr's directives to the PCG during its 122nd founding anniversary as it moved forward to provide better public service to the Filipino nation. ""I expect the PCG to provide steadfast service and dedication to duty during times of calamity; uphold our country's maritime security and promote our maritime rights; do its part in fighting smuggling; protect our marine environment; and secure the safety of our fishermen when pursuing their means of livelihood,"" DOTr Secretary Bautista highlighted. ""The Department of Transportation firmly stands with you in your plans and efforts to improve, expand, and modernize your capabilities and services so you can level up your efforts at securing the welfare of our people and our nation,"" he concluded. The Chief Executive chose CG Vice Admiral Gavan among five recommended candidates to take over the Coast Guard helm following the retirement of CG Admiral Artemio Abu after over 35 years of public service on the same date. Before the said appointment, CG Vice Admiral Gavan served as the PCG's Deputy Commandant for Administration. He was also instrumental in training and capacity-building female Coast Guardians as radio operators dubbed ""Angels of the Sea"" on board PCG vessels patrolling the West Philippine Sea (WPS). The 30th PCG Commandant is a proud member of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Maalab Class of 1993.

Why am I addressing you? Well, because of the second part of the sentence, one of the greatest, in human history, who said, I quote: ""The world is a wicked place to live in not because of the people who do EVIL, but because of the people who sit back and let it happen... Albert Einstein"". Because how to explain the fact that the above-mentioned ""Muslim community"" in the narrower and wider environment, numbers over 400 million Muslims (Syria 21, Egypt 109, Jordan 11, Lebanon 5, Libya 7, Iraq 44, Iran 88, Turkey 85, Saudi Arabia 34 ..), which you lead, which has watched the complete destruction of the Palestinian people for 7 decades and you do nothing. Assuming the reasons why this is so, trying to understand your lack of empathy, I must say that I grew up in Sarajevo in a Muslim neighborhood, where I learned that there is no greater ""SEVAP"" than that of doing a good deed and helping someone poor, humiliated, the oppressed, the unfortunate, regardless of religion, ethnicity, gender, status... which is also promoted by St. the book ""Quran"". In this regard, I expect you to URGENTLY, before it is too late, NOT TO GO TO WAR, but to do the following: - use your political, economic, financial and any other power (except military) to ensure an unconditional end to the armed conflict, A CRUISE IMMEDIATELY, - ensure the immediate delivery of HUMANITARIAN AID to the Gaza Strip and Palestine in general, including, at least part of the funds (which you and your family members spend in senseless competitions about who will have a bigger tower, more residences, luxury cars, yachts, jewelry and branded goods, but also cheap labor force, some say slaves of (truncated)",,4692,"{'like_count': 2130, 'comment_count': 376, 'num_users': 13247}",Zlatko Miletiƒá,,2023-10-19 15:36:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/251482711_299721342154719_8793850653559317711_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2G5DnzLlg5oAX-Ia8nW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCvrjLfpJYtCIcpXKZNJ-6mveo9hOntr56rpSqOzURaWQ&oe=655A6E48,https://www.facebook.com/100063505669290/posts/830544519072396,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392773054_830544485739066_1984539894611574362_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=5XO-r6p4MooAX_bawYQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCMFngsgvr1LVbk70BLiXnc3jo5I5MuxgzfAG2qcFK3Sw&oe=6547DE62

Im scared, disturbed, deeply saddened. We can always be doing more. Ive been silent regarding the conflict about the war between Israel and Palestine because as some of you may know I recently just kept in touch with my father and my family who is now living in Palestine, Gaza. I‚Äôve been keeping my thoughts to myself because I felt like ‚ÄúOH I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO FORM AN OPINION"" or ‚ÄúIM NOT THAT CULTURALLY INFORMED‚Äù. But it doesn‚Äôt have to end there. Get educated. I would like to express my deep sorrow for the Israelis who have lost their lives and been injured in the dreadful terrorist attacks. Hamas killing civilians was HORRIBLE but Israel countering by killing 10√ó more civilians is beyond insane. I cannot remain silent in the face of the Israeli government's attempt to seek revenge from innocent civilians for the terrorist attack. I will not remain silent about this genocide either specially that my family‚Äôs life depends on it. In Israel's attacks, one Palestinian loses their life every 5 minutes. Every hour, 3 children lose their lives. Can a baby be a terrorist? How can so many be so silent? What are you scared of? Scared to defend basic human rights as innocent people are murdered.

facebook,"""I couldn‚Äôt shift anything, I resigned"" A senior official at the US State Department issued his resignation on Wednesday evening, citing the Biden administration‚Äôs approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict. ‚ÄúLet me be clear: Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities,‚Äù Josh Paul said in a letter, which was posted on X by Brian Finucane, a senior adviser at Crisis Group. ‚ÄúBut I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response, and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people - and is not in the long term American interest.‚Äù Paul worked for more than 10 years in the State Department‚Äôs Political-Military Affairs bureau, which is in charge of approving arms transfers to other countries. In an interview with Huffington Post, Paul said that he resigned because he ""couldn‚Äôt shift anything"". Biden has been clear in stating that he will support Israel unequivocally as it takes action against Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, which on 7 October launched a surprise attack on Israel. The war has so far killed more than 3,000 Palestinians, including around 1,000 children and 1,000 women, while also killing more than 1,400 Israelis. MEE reported last week that the White House‚Äôs phrasing of any calls for a ceasefire were ‚Äúrepugnant‚Äù, sending a chilling message to progressive lawmakers and anti-war activists. The Biden administration is currently drafting a major foreign aid bill that would include $10bn for Israel. In addition to the aid package, the US has also deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern Mediterranean and has readied 2,000 American troops to be deployed in order to support Israel, as the country readies for a ground invasion of Gaza. ‚ÄúI cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse,‚Äù Paul said further in his letter. 4m",,3819,"{'like_count': 2052, 'comment_count': 484, 'num_users': 1921391}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-19 10:30:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/291028422_410373144459463_4151778888964342317_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=L1wHiXsOmuAAX_kDcgS&_nc_oc=AQl7Cxb6m4E9oWWRaloZ7VPqwBvyKZPvKffsiwmDWPSw9jL9lWoagfjiwVjGa9XoJfw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBef7B_qtzmlJDR_6rsQa6JMwcf30uorWT7fdel2xySVA&oe=655AEB02,https://www.facebook.com/100064603425232/posts/732188228944618,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392824288_732188182277956_4244153578575105845_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LFs5-h0pYF0AX8m7dH0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB3eMLHFFZDQ8tckRJwKc29HqTE2M2DHf-9vZhggcrS1g&oe=65395AAB

facebook,"Whet Sheikh Gumi should understand is that if twins are separated at birth and adopted by a Christian and Muslim family, respectively, they will grow up and likely take their parent‚Äôs religion. That is why we must stop hating people based on their religion. People mostly don't choose their faith. It chose them. Most people are just a product of parental conditioning. That is why they say things like ‚ÄòI was born a Christian' or 'I was born a Muslim‚Äô. You were not born as an adherent of any religion. You entered this world with only one identity, which is the identity of a human being. It is on Earth you met religion. And you will leave it here. Because there is no religion in heaven except love! Sheikh Gumi's statement about not trusting Christians with Nigeria's security is regrettable and disturbing. We have come together as a country for 63 years, and this type of statement sets us back and builds distrust. We need competence and patriotism to tackle insecurity, not religious bias. Did Sheikh Gumi experience the kind of insecurity he saw in Kaduna under Nasir El-Rufai during the administration of Patrick Yakowa, a Christian? That, right there, disproves his theory. How can he think that Wike will make the FCT an extension of Israel and people with beards will be killed? That type of thinking is unfounded. Wike has no power over the Army, Navy, Air Force, or the Paramilitary Forces. Those are squarely under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, who is a Muslim, like Gumi. We have, to a large extent, successfully managed our diversity in Nigeria, and it will be most helpful if we do not allow the conflict in Palestine and Israel to cause us to hate each other. Nigeria is not Israel. Nigeria is a heterogeneous country that should serve as an example of peaceful religious coexistence to Israel if we get our acts right. #TableShaker",,3232,"{'like_count': 1845, 'comment_count': 985, 'num_users': 508417}",Reno Omokri,,2023-10-19 19:08:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/366941915_793197049268657_6956849172733503415_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Ox86enGaHB0AX_J04Sq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC-hS0_cMUW4cM_x5WqbkyCcYBWQ3vcB5ofaPCWz8LLKg&oe=655A4B04,https://www.facebook.com/100057351074401/posts/831064875481874,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393926211_831064772148551_3841096195963917380_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bZ2CMdyuPIwAX_NfeNB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD0ONBbeqBwv7y_Ts90F6Z-AI6lThlFSP-8aoXxZUwEFA&oe=65515341

facebook,"Amid the escalating violence in the Israel-Gaza conflict, the blame game on the international stage is intensifying. The recent U.S. veto of a UN resolution calling for a cease-fire illuminated America's stance, with the U.S. Ambassador delineating a clear line of blame towards Hamas for the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. In a detailed address, the U.S. Ambassador mourned the tragic loss of life from the explosion at the Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital in Gaza, expressing horror and sadness. Yet, the narrative swiftly pivoted to lay blame when the ambassador stated, 'Let's be clear. Hamas's own actions have brought this on ‚Äî this severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Hamas has caused so much needless suffering, death, and destruction.' The U.S. viewpoint reiterating Israel's right to self-defense has drawn criticism from various quarters, pointing to the stark power disparity between Israel and Gaza, and the devastating toll on civilian life the conflict continues to take. The unfolding narrative of blame, critics argue, overshadows the humanitarian imperative to alleviate the suffering of those caught in the crossfire.",,2887,"{'like_count': 426, 'comment_count': 1455, 'num_users': 10428136}",NowThis Politics,,2023-10-19 22:30:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352572773_601212558477580_1162756159947910709_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=i0hZdK9etT4AX9jxWWf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDlwacfZFeyzgJ56hSuuZ7Wwv9mCfqOaeVWhRrhaKQFtQ&oe=655A43CD,https://www.facebook.com/100064655201117/posts/714405467391287,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393877253_1031555904626633_2668620587473295344_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=gNh1gzl_JlIAX8p6-gk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDLRLDAQuHZU0HROiBnxb31gyqPbqzbsD6f6RdFf9eoSw&oe=654467B4

Ive been silent about the conflict about the war between Israel and Palestine because as some of you may know I recently just kept in touch with my father and my family who is now living in Palestine, Gaza. I‚Äôve been keeping my thoughts to myself because I felt like ‚ÄúOH I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO FORM AN OPINION"" or ‚ÄúIM NOT THAT CULTURALLY INFORMED‚Äù. But it doesn‚Äôt have to end there. Get educated. I would like to express my deep sorrow for the Israelis who have lost their lives and been injured in the dreadful terrorist attacks. Hamas killing civilians was HORRIBLE but Israel countering by killing 10√ó more civilians is beyond insane. I cannot remain silent in the face of the Israeli government's attempt to seek revenge from innocent civilians for the terrorist attack. I will not remain silent about this genocide either specially that my family‚Äôs life depends on it. In Israel's attacks, one Palestinian loses their life every 5 minutes. Every hour, 3 children lose their lives. Can a baby be a terrorist? How can so many be so silent? What are you scared of? Scared to defend basic human rights as innocent people are murdered. It‚Äôs been a long dark tunnel since oct 7 and a long way to go to immerge from this horendous situation.

facebook,"The Gambia Government‚Äôs statement on the Gaza- Israel conflict Government of the Republic of The Gambia joins the International Community including United Nations (UN), Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), The African Union (AU) and others in vehemently condemning the Israeli Military operations in Gaza for almost two weeks including stoppage of electricity, water, food aid, medical supplies, fuel and the indiscriminate bombing of Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza where over 500 innocent Palestinians were killed mostly women, children, the disabled and sick patients. Taking into cognizance the fact that Palestinians have for long been fighting for their legitimate and inalienable rights for self-determination for over 75 years without any success; and given the usurpation of their territories and freedoms by the Occupying Power, the State of Israel, their situation became so dire that utter desperation resulted in this unfortunate war in Gaza. The Government of The Gambia calls for an unconditional ceasefire and the release of all hostages to prevent more bloodshed and the proposed invasion of Gaza which could result not only in more deaths and destruction but also in forcibly displacing Palestinian citizens in Gaza and the West Bank and in doing so build more Israeli settlements in those areas. The Government of the Gambia further appeals to the International Community to compel the Occupying Power to abide by the tenets of the Peace process, International Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Security Council Resolutions. Failure to do so is bound to prolong the conflict, cause further instability and diminish the chances fora resolution of this conflict. The Government of The Gambia, given that Israeli Military aggression is used as an instrument of collective punishment causing huge loss of life, property and injuries on both sides since the occupation of Palestine in 1948, calls for an International Peace Conference for a permanent and durable solution to this very protracted Palestinian problem. The Government of The Gambia considers that: the best option for a peaceful settlement of this dispute between the two parties is not a military one but a comprehensive Peace Accord based on the ""Two-Party Solution"" guaranteeing both States their legitimate and inalienable rights to full sovereignty and self-determination. The Government of The Gambia, in this context, reaffirms its support for the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate national rights, as recognized by the International Community through its recognition of a State of Palestine within the borders of June 4th, 1967, with Al-Quds Al- Shareef as its Capital as indicated in all relevant UN, OIC and AU Resolutions. On behalf of H.E. The President of the Republic of The Gambia Mr. Adama Barrow, The Government and People of The Gambia express deepest condolences for the tragic loss of life and property on both sides and wish all those injured speedy recovery and pray that this tragedy which continues to unfold before our own eyes will soon cease and never be repeated again.

facebook,"Probably a lot of you already know this; I just found out and was fascinated. I wanted to share for those who might be interested to learn as well. ""Gandalf is making three very specific references as both warning and challenge to the Balrog. By identifying himself as a servant of the secret fire (or Flame imperishable), Gandalf is identifying himself as a Maia, an embodied angelic servant of the Valar protecting the light of Creation that Eru Iluvatar (or God) has set to burn at the centre of Arda (Earth). Wielder of the flame of Anor is a reference to his ability to draw on the power of the sun possibly through the Ring of Fire, Narya, but maybe also through his own divine origins. Finally as he refers to the Balrog as the Flame of Udun, he informs the Balrog that he knows it to be a corrupted Maia in the service of Morgoth from the earliest time when he resided as Melkor in his dark fortress of Utumno broken by the Valar at the awakening of the Elves. He orders it to retreat (""go back to the shadows"") or face the consequences of divine conflict and final judgement before the Vala Mandos, the fate of all slain creatures.""",,2382,"{'like_count': 1724, 'comment_count': 161, 'num_users': 290556}",Fans of Middle-Earth,,2023-10-19 18:15:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/118192743_1497228253819168_3241036018800844953_n.jpg?stp=c18.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=C7PoeBMLlxAAX-3v101&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDDN1C1AE3VRkXRJ6scMEihcNbyfgLdJVQSWpVoIR-Jfw&oe=657D3E51,https://www.facebook.com/groups/730287994209553/permalink/1502039443701067,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391621111_10227557615699263_2722436952485248933_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=u26VNS8BEtIAX9krnr1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD51nAfF-Ih5q6qVera6t1fSjt1zh5g9300ciiNKTBj2A&oe=6535B265

While loathe to add one more uninformed voice to the cacophony, I am compelled to contribute my own sorrow to the collective mourning of lost Israeli and Palestinian lives, lost freedom, lost hope, lost intact families, lost basic human rights, lost necessities to even survive. I can‚Äôt imagine what it has been like to live in an occupied land for almost four generations. I can‚Äôt imagine what it is like to have your children kidnapped. I can‚Äôt imagine having my street bombed. I can‚Äôt imagine having my water and food supply cut off with my babies in the house. I can‚Äôt imagine losing my neighbors to a terrorist attack. I can‚Äôt imagine living inside a conflict that is centuries old. I can‚Äôt imagine 1000 dead children in a day. I can‚Äôt imagine getting my wounded loved one to a hospital only to have it bombed. I can‚Äôt help but think like a mother. Ordinary citizens are not the government. Regular neighbors are not the terrorist organization. Almost all of us who exist in the world are just daughters and sons and moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles, innocents, all. We are just friends and community members. We want the same things: basic freedom, safety, and the possibility of goodness for our families. When I think about how many Palestinian and Israeli mothers are going to bed tonight having lost their children, terrified of more violence, just normal people in normal towns, I weep. We aren‚Äôt the lawmakers, the legislators, the ambassadors, or the power brokers. Nor are we the terrorists, the kidnappers, the murderers, or the abusers. Also notably, we aren‚Äôt the pundits, analysts, experts, or strategists. We are just the ordinary global neighbors of the ordinary people of Palestine and Israel, and our tool is compassion. I wish with all my heart for stabilization, liberation, safety, and the end of war for our neighbors. I wish for free people living on free land. I wish all moms could put their babies to bed tonight without fear. In this grant round for Legacy Collective, Global Empowerment Mission is nominated who is supporting all refugees fleeing the region through Egypt.

facebook,"The Middle East Problem, It's Not Complex ""When I did my graduate studies at the Middle East Institute at Columbia University‚Äôs School of International Affairs, I took many courses on the question of the Middle East conflict. Semester after semester, we studied the Middle East conflict as if it was the most complex conflict in the world -- when in fact, it is probably the easiest conflict in the world to explain. It may be the hardest to solve, but it is the easiest to explain. In a nutshell, it‚Äôs this: One side wants the other side dead. Israel wants to exist as a Jewish state and to live in peace. Israel also recognizes the right of Palestinians to have their own state and to live in peace. The problem, however, is that most Palestinians and many other Muslims and Arabs, do not recognize the right of the Jewish state of Israel to exist. This has been true since 1947, when the United Nations voted to divide the land called Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The Jews accepted the United Nations partition but no Arab or any other Muslim country accepted it. When British rule ended on May 15, 1948, the armies of all the neighboring Arab states -- Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Transjordan, and Egypt -- attacked the one-day old state of Israel in order to destroy it. But, to the world‚Äôs surprise, the little Jewish state survived. Then it happened again. In 1967, the dictator of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser, announced his plan, in his words, ‚Äúto destroy Israel.‚Äù He placed Egyptian troops on Israel‚Äôs border, and armies of surrounding Arab countries were also mobilized to attack. However, Israel preemptively attacked Egypt and Syria. Israel did not attack Jordan, and begged Jordan‚Äôs king not to join the war. But he did. And only because of that did Israel take control of Jordanian land, specifically the ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù of the Jordan River. Shortly after the war, the Arab states went to Khartoum, Sudan and announced their famous three ‚ÄúNo‚Äôs: ‚ÄúNo recognition, no peace, and no negotiations,‚Äù What was Israel supposed to do? Well, one thing Israel did, a little more than a decade later, in 1978, was to give the entire Sinai Peninsula -- an area of land bigger than Israel itself, and with oil -- back to Egypt because Egypt, under new leadership, signed a peace agreement with Israel. So, Israel gave land for the promise of peace with Egypt, and it has always been willing to do the same thing with the Palestinians. All the Palestinians have ever had to do is recognize Israel as a Jewish state and promise to live in peace with it. But when Israel has proposed trading land for peace -- as it did in 2000 when it agreed to give the Palestinians a sovereign state in more than 95% of the West Bank and all of Gaza -- the Palestinian leadership rejected the offer, and instead responded by sending waves of suicide terrorists into Israel. Meanwhile, Palestinian radio, television, and school curricula remain filled with glorification of terrorists, demonization of Jews, and the daily repeated message that Israel should cease to exist. So it‚Äôs not hard to explain the Middle-East dispute. One side wants the other dead. The motto of Hamas, the Palestinian rulers of Gaza, is: ‚ÄúWe love death as much as the Jews love life.‚Äù There are 22 Arab states in the world -- stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean. There is one ‚ÄúJewish State‚Äù in the world. And it is about the size of New Jersey. In fact, tiny El Salvador is larger than Israel. Finally, think about these two questions: If, tomorrow, Israel laid down its arms and announced, ‚ÄúWe will fight no more,‚Äù what would happen? And if the Arab countries around Israel laid down their arms and announced ‚ÄúWe will fight no more,‚Äù what would happen? In the first case there would be an immediate destruction of the state of Israel and the mass murder of its Jewish population. In the second case, there would be peace the next day. As I said at the outset, it is a simple problem to describe: one side wants the other dead -- and if it didn‚Äôt, there would be peace. Please remember this: There has never been a state in the geographic area known as Palestine that was not Jewish. Israel is the third Jewish state to exist in that area. There was never an Arab state, never a Palestinian state, never a Muslim or any other state. That‚Äôs the issue: why can‚Äôt the one Jewish state the size of El Salvador be allowed to exist? That is the Middle-East problem.

At her daughter‚Äôs school, she meets charming PE teacher Dan (Benjamin Ayres), as well as two moms, Marissa (Amit) and Kelly (Chan-Kent). The three women are roped into signing up for the field day planning committee by a manipulative PTO president, Suzanne (Jocelyn Gauthier).

But Jen, still mourning the loss of her husband, flip-flops over whether she‚Äôs ready to date Dan, and Dan is pessimistic that any romance can ever end happily. Meanwhile, the women‚Äôs plans for a successful field day are threatened by Suzanne‚Äôs sabotage and some foul weather. **PROS** *The leads.* Rachel Boston is a versatile actress who elevates every movie she‚Äôs in, and *Field Day* is no exception. She‚Äôs great in comic roles as well as dramatic ones, and here, Boston had the opportunity to play both. Opposite Ayres, who also shone in this movie, she was a delight. Their banter was playful and clever, and I instantly felt a strong sync between their characters, Jen and Dan. The two had many great scenes together, including a wonderfully honest first date. When their conversation shifted from joking around to serious matters‚ÄîDan getting dumped by the woman he was about to propose to, and the heart-wrenching death of Jen‚Äôs husband‚Äîthey felt as if they‚Äôd shared too much of the wrong sort of information for a first date, and they joked awkwardly about it being the worst first date ever. The scene was full of mixed emotions; what began as fun and flirtatious morphed into a baring of souls that made each of them uncomfortable, and they admitted that discomfort. Jen and Dan‚Äôs hesitation to get involved with each other, in spite of their undeniable attraction, was beautifully conveyed by Boston and Ayres. *A tear-jerking scene.* Get out the Kleenex. After the date was over and Jen concluded she wasn‚Äôt ready for romance, her mother gave her a video that her late husband, Nate (Matt Clarke), had made in case Jen felt stuck and couldn‚Äôt move on after he passed away. Nate‚Äôs video showed how perfectly in tune he and Jen had been with each other. He anticipated what her responses would be to what he was saying, joking about the Live, Love, Laugh sign, for instance, which he knew she‚Äôd find cheesy. But most importantly, he urged her to continue living and to seek happiness. The video blended poignancy with humour, and it was exactly what Jen needed to see before she could embrace the possibility of a future with Dan. *A women‚Äôs buddy movie.* The friendship between the moms was as important as Jen and Dan‚Äôs budding relationship. All three moms were different in terms of personality and background; Jen was a down-to-earth web designer, Marissa a tightly wound workaholic lawyer, and Kelly a bubbly social media star. Yet despite these differences, and their bickering, they became good pals during the course of planning for field day. Many of the film‚Äôs liveliest moments came from the scenes between the women‚Äîfor example, the pumpkin baking competition in which they botched their cake, and the pop-up bar dance scene in which they let loose. And the moms supported each other in overcoming their issues: Jen‚Äôs reluctance to date, Marissa‚Äôs difficulty in relaxing and asking for help, and Kelly‚Äôs inability to just be herself. It was an enjoyable depiction of female friendship that allowed for the reality of some conflict. **CONS** *A couple of stereotypical characters.* Though I mostly liked this film, and I have no doubt that Shannon Chan-Kent is a capable actress, I found her character, Kelly, to be annoying for too much of *Field Day*. It‚Äôs not the first time Hallmark has portrayed influencers in their movies, and the personality type isn‚Äôt appealing. They're always shown as overly perky, superficial, and self-absorbed, obsessed with posting every moment of their lives. Kelly was no exception. At least the source of Kelly‚Äôs phoniness became clear: her online friends were so valuable to her because she associated friendship in real life with being hurt. And at least she gradually became open to exposing her real self. The bully of the story, Suzanne, was also a stereotype‚Äîall smiles on the surface, but underneath that, twisting the knife. Although Suzanne was a minor character, it would have been refreshing if she hadn‚Äôt been so one-dimensional. My grade for **Field Day**: B+",,1605,"{'like_count': 1161, 'comment_count': 129, 'num_users': 70867}",Hallmark Fans' Movies & Christmas Movies Discussion,,2023-10-19 21:04:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/119864138_2836687696561096_8708561557202313809_n.jpg?stp=c43.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=IPs1LUMG108AX-HK2a2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAZFaZaZ1X-7ebrtuPY_BDRRe9-_LzNyjLbHP6TpAVu8A&oe=657D3279,https://www.facebook.com/groups/657911001527168/permalink/1313647775953484,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393305647_10168374668875191_7826911571069832467_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=F9w65jt1gD8AX-uBqEi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA6-knHhRrZWIGxS3Io6szDfSILL-sfQG8vF1hKYS1p9w&oe=6539AA1B

facebook,"""Gulliver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift is a satirical novel published in 1726. It tells the story of Lemuel Gulliver's voyages to various fantastical lands, including Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, and the land of the Houyhnhnms. The novel is renowned for its sharp satire and hidden meanings, often criticizing various aspects of society and humanity. Here are a few key themes in ""Gulliver's Travels"": 1. **Political Satire**: The book satirizes the political landscape of Swift's time. For instance, the conflict between the tiny Lilliputians and the giant Brobdingnagians can be seen as a commentary on the petty disputes among European nations. 2. **Social Critique**: Swift uses the differences between the societies Gulliver encounters to critique various aspects of British society, such as the legal system, government corruption, and the role of the monarchy. 3. **Human Nature**: Gulliver's encounters with different societies highlight the flaws in human nature. The Houyhnhnms, a rational horse-like species, are contrasted with the Yahoos, a degenerate and brutish human-like species, emphasizing the dark aspects of humanity. 4. **Religious and Philosophical Critique**: Swift uses the Laputians and their obsession with theoretical knowledge to criticize the over-intellectualization of society. The Struldbrugs represent the idea of immortality as a curse, critiquing the pursuit of eternal life. 5. **Colonialism and Imperialism**: Gulliver's travels can also be seen as a reflection on the British Empire's expansion and colonialism. His experiences with the Lilliputians and the Houyhnhnms touch on the theme of European imperialism. 6. **Human Size**: The changing scale of Gulliver throughout the book may symbolize the relativity of power and perspective, highlighting how one's status in society can shift based on circumstances. In ""Gulliver's Travels,"" Swift employs allegory, irony, and symbolism to convey his critical views on politics, society, and human nature. The hidden meanings and satirical elements in the book continue to make it a rich source for analysis and interpretation.",,1408,"{'like_count': 961, 'comment_count': 64, 'num_users': 100284}",English literature,,2023-10-19 20:15:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/299528495_445026350972793_8155050084057353263_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=FZZjUKsCdGkAX-fn84k&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDzC_yVQ2jKafXX78aNohn8jkCdKuosROGtB2DFc7a9hg&oe=655ACA0C,https://www.facebook.com/100063962958074/posts/735326401942785,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394078766_735326378609454_3400936692584489253_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=zB7udz0OgQYAX92a_UA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA7jAezGS6PXU-4LY6seBccgqO8vAP4Xp7hY1QjQCNmUQ&oe=6535EA33
facebook,"Inzamam-ul-Haq, the former Pakistan cricket captain, is reportedly considering stepping down from his role as chief selector due to disagreements with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Sources suggest that Inzamam is dissatisfied with the appointment of Shahid Anwar as the head coach of the U19 men's team, as he had advocated for former Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Yousaf to be given the position. This is not the first instance of conflict between Inzamam and the PCB, as they have had differences in the past as well. Recently, Inzamam had signed a contract worth Rs2.5 million per month with the PCB. However, the PCB has refuted these claims, with a spokesperson stating that Inzamam had actively participated in the selection process for the U19 men's team and the women's A team, and they had no knowledge of any discord between Inzamam and the board. Earlier in the month, Inzamam was appointed as the chairman of the Junior Men's Cricket Selection Committee, adding to his existing responsibilities as the head of the senior selection committee. The senior selection committee includes Tauseef Ahmed, Wajahatullah Wasti, and Wasim Haider, while the junior selection committee consists of Aamer Nazir, Javed Hayat, Mahmood Hamid, Naveed Latif, Salman Ahmed, and Sanaullah Baloch. In a separate development, former captain Mohammad Hafeez recently announced his resignation from the PCB Technical Committee via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), expressing his gratitude to chairman Zaka Ashraf and conveying his best wishes to Pakistan cricket. Hafeez's decision to step down from the committee came after a brief tenure of just under two months.",,1406,"{'like_count': 666, 'comment_count': 328, 'num_users': 3042876}",Startup Pakistan,,2023-10-19 08:14:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/367488900_662067085957271_5127465217167829722_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=o2xHT5lrdxYAX8etQBI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD3-4X5uTVKWbOmx4tYI12vtpW-jjOgUHRDt7e4FKFoYw&oe=6559FB94,https://www.facebook.com/100064619564569/posts/702450831918896,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393953451_702450705252242_1751402956175539560_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Vo4R9fsarA4AX-uR88L&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfANpRRgBGrUGQHyPDxPTzmsdbYDUn9YmJoJcpPvyOoP1Q&oe=65393984
facebook,"WHEN BATTLE IS SPIRITUAL When the battle is spiritual, it means you are fighting with forces you cannot see. You may hear a voice calling your name, but can't see anyone. It is a spiritual battle. When you are pressed down in your sleep or attacked in your dream, or you are always being pursued, or when you wake up, you see mysterious marks on your body, or you usually eat food or sexually harassed in the dream, these are spiritual battles. You can't confront these powers physically. When someone place a curse on you or cast a spell on you through divination or enchantment or by means of a charm, these are spiritual battles. You may know that something is wrong; but in most cases, you may not be able to trace its origin. These are spiritual arrows. Numbers 23:23 says: ""Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!"" All of the things mentioned above are spiritual battles with intent to limit destinies, put one on the run, and ultimately, destroy. The use of sorcery, invocation and divination to send the messenger of Satan against somebody is a spiritual battle. However, no matter how spiritual the battle, Ephesians 6:10-11 tells us to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. And that we should put on the whole armour of God so that we maybe able to stand against the wiles of the devil. To be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might is to be strong in the Word of God and be filled with the Holy Spirit always praying in the Spirit. To put on the whole armour of God is to wear the various aspects of the armour and not just a piece of the armour - this is done by declaring and walking in the truth of scripture, i.e. be a believer and a doer of the word of God. Also, Philippians 2:10 tells us that the name of JESUS is more than able to give us victory in every spiritual conflict. Shalom! #pstnath.

facebook,"Overnight, at the request of Brazil, the United Nations held a UN Security Council session to vote on a resolution that called for humanitarian pauses to deliver lifesaving aid to millions in Gaza. Of the 15 member states, 12 voted in favour. Two abstained. The United States voted No. As a permanent member of the Security Council, their No vote vetoes the entire Resolution. ‚ÄòNo‚Äô to a humanitarian pause in a conflict that has killed over 1500 Palestinian children. ‚ÄòNo‚Äô to a humanitarian pause in an open-air prison deprived of food, water and electricity. ‚ÄòNo‚Äô to a humanitarian pause that would ensure that medicine and surgical supplies are provided to hospitals under siege. This is an unfathomable aiding and abetting of what is a war crime. Do you know what makes people harbour deep hatred? Oppression. And I refuse to be a party to oppression. I refuse to be silent when the number of bombs dropped on helpless civilians in Gaza is greater than the number of bombs the USA dropped in Afghanistan over an entire year. I refuse to be silent when I see entire families wiped out. I refuse to be silent when hospitals are bombed, journalists are killed, and the Palestinians are described as ‚Äòhuman animals‚Äô or ‚Äòchildren of darkness‚Äô. I refuse to allow the hasbara narrative, that Palestinians are literally killing themselves, be propagated unchallenged. Hate Hamas all you want. The slaughter of innocent non-combatants and women and children is a massive sin in Islam, and deserves condemnation if it occurs. But remember this: there is no Hamas in the West Bank and Palestinians are still degraded, subjugated, and humiliated there. There is no Hamas in the West Bank and settlers terrorise the people they are illegally occupying with complete impunity by the security forces enabling them. There is no Hamas in the West Bank and yet thousands of Palestinians are rounded up, arbitrarily detained, tortured and thousands have been murdered over the last 40 years. I don‚Äôt care how many ‚Äòfollowers‚Äô it costs me, or how much hate I get. I will say it until my lips bleed: #FreePalestine - Sara Addit: I will always love and respect my brothers and sisters from the Jewish faith. I will reject all forms of anti-Semitism.

He emphasized the need for their preparedness in maintaining law and order, with a focus on safeguarding lives and property within the country.

Realizing that we‚Äôre rarely in the spotlight releases you from your inhibitions, anxieties, fears‚Äîit frees you up to do what you were too afraid to do, pursue what matters with no fear of judgment. „Ö§ Not only that, realizing life is rarely about you turns your attention outwards, gives you space to be more *curious* about other people and the world. „Ö§ Curiosity, I‚Äôd argue, is the most important habit anyone can cultivate. It cures anxiety, ignorance, selfishness, extremism. It creates empathy, compassion, knowledge, growth. It prevents arrogance, judgment, stagnation. „Ö§ And it can save your relationship. „Ö§ Glori, a therapist and newsletter reader, regularly prescribes curiosity for her clients. In her words: „Ö§ ""When we‚Äôre curious, we‚Äôre less critical, more open-minded, it engenders empathy, and we have the opportunity to learn more about our partners. „Ö§ Some of the questions that I suggest my clients ask are: „Ö§ - What‚Äôs important about that to you? - Can you tell me more about that? - Is there something that you‚Äôd like me to do differently?"" „Ö§ The next time you find yourself in conflict with your partner, prescribe yourself a healthy dose of curiosity and try some of Glori‚Äôs questions. „Ö§ You may be surprised by the answers. „Ö§ Become part of a free and interactive community of over half a million people inspiring each other‚Äôs growth every week.

facebook,"I'm going to spend a few days on this verse because there is a lot to this little verse, and I encourage you to do the same. Don't forget to pray for eyesalve and Jesus's Holy Spirit. Genesis 3:15 King James Version üîéüëâüèª15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. üí°üëâüèªThe divine sentence pronounced against Satan after the fall of man, was also a prophecy, embracing all the ages to the close of time, and foreshadowing the great conflict to engage all the races of men who should live upon the earth. 4SP 324.1 üí°üëâüèªGod declares, ""I will put enmity."" This enmity is not naturally entertained. When man transgressed the divine law, his nature became evil, and he was in harmony, and not at variance, with Satan. There exists naturally no enmity between sinful man and the originator of sin. Both became evil through apostasy. The apostate is never at rest, except as he obtains sympathy and support by inducing others to follow his example. For this reason, fallen angels and wicked men unite in desperate companionship. Had not God specially interposed, Satan and man would have entered into an alliance against Heaven; and instead of cherishing enmity against Satan, the whole human family would have been united in opposition to God. 4SP 324.2 üí°üëâüèªThe grace that Christ implants in the soul creates the enmity against Satan. Without this converting grace and renewing power, man would continue the captive of Satan, a servant ever ready to do his bidding. But the new principle in the soul creates conflict where hitherto had been peace. The power which Christ imparts, enables man to resist the tyrant and usurper. Whoever is seen to abhor sin instead of loving it, whoever resists and conquers those passions that have held sway within, displays the operation of a principle wholly from above. 4SP 325.2 üí°üëâüèªThe antagonism that exists between the spirit of Christ and the spirit of Satan was most strikingly displayed in the world's reception of Jesus. It was not so much because he appeared without worldly wealth, pomp, or grandeur, that the Jews were led to reject him. They saw that he possessed power which would more than compensate for the lack of these outward advantages. But the purity and holiness of Christ called forth against him the hatred of the ungodly. His life of self-denial and sinless devotion was a perpetual reproof to a proud, sensual people. It was this that evoked enmity against the Son of God. Satan and evil angels joined with evil men. All the energies of apostasy conspired against the champion of truth. 4SP 325.3 ‚ö†Ô∏èüëâüèªWhile men are ignorant of his devices, this vigilant foe is upon their track every moment. ‚ö†Ô∏èüëâüèªHe is intruding his presence in every department of the household, in every street of our cities, in the churches, üëàüèªin the councils, üëàüèªin the courts of justice, perplexing, deceiving, seducing, everywhere ruining the souls and bodies of men, women, and children, breaking up families, sowing hatred, emulation, strife, sedition, murder. And the Christian world seem to regard these things as though God had appointed them, and they must exist. ‚ö†Ô∏èüëâüèªSatan is continually seeking to overcome the people of God by breaking down the barriers which separate them from the world. Ancient Israel were enticed into sin when they ventured into forbidden association with the heathen. In a similar manner are modern Israel led astray. ""The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."" 2 Corinthians 4:4. All who are not decided followers of Christ are servants of Satan. In the unregenerate heart there is love of sin, and a disposition to cherish and excuse it. In the renewed heart there is hatred of sin, and determined resistance against it. When Christians choose the society of the ungodly and unbelieving, they expose themselves to temptation. Satan conceals himself from view, and stealthily draws his bandage across their eyes. They cannot see that such company is calculated to do them harm, and while all the time assimilating to the world in character, words, and actions, they are becoming more and more blinded. Familiarity with sin inevitably causes it to appear less repulsive. He who chooses to associate with the servants of Satan soon ceases to fear their master. 4SP 327.2 - 4SP 327.3 I want to show you something! ‚ö†Ô∏èüëâüèªSatan assailed Christ with his fiercest and most subtle temptations; but he was repulsed in every conflict. Those battles were fought in our behalf; those victories make it possible for us to conquer. Christ will give strength to all who seek it. 4SP 330.1 üóùüôèüèªüëâüèª No man without his own consent can be overcome by Satan. The tempter has no power to control the will or to force the soul to sin. He may distress, but he cannot contaminate. He can cause agony, (truncated)",,1140,"{'like_count': 791, 'comment_count': 73, 'num_users': 888296}",Ellen G White Quotes,,2023-10-19 17:33:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/13263896_282172622121701_6635017671503531986_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=T2K1I7-ys7kAX_JPD5O&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCzQlQZ01Gu3bHH3YFvNK_awOpaJSBNS3YdgMxwxSokLw&oe=657D1901,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1131540740243214/permalink/7046709108726318,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394268975_859589029153459_2647382018398288712_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jdika_q3POcAX-AgCPI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDfYZ3hFGmZfrK2ykZB30XJA54QHNjtoJsZXA69kJx0Zw&oe=6535985D

facebook,"Question: Hamas terrorist‚ÅâÔ∏èWhat does the law say‚ÅâÔ∏è by Christophe Oberlin For historians, Palestine has existed for more than 3000 years; the modern State of Palestine for a century, according to jurists ‚Äì with recognised borders, its own judicial system, Palestinian passports, stamps and currency. A State of Palestine that made international agreements with surrounding countries, including the mandatory power, the United Kingdom. So, the current war does not start on Saturday, 7 October, 2023. Palestine has been at war since 1948. And it resembles an active volcano that rumbles every day, with suffering and anger. Sometimes with explosions. The eruption we are witnessing today is the most powerful since 1948. The Palestinian people are not demanding anything: they are demanding the restoration of their sovereign rights to their land. The current eruption is the consequence of this initial violation of the law. Yet, for Western governments, it is the Palestinian people who have become the culprit. Legal action, through the interplay of principles, makes it possible to re-establish reality. We have to go back to the origin of the conflict, to 1917, with the Western desire to create a settlement in the Middle East to control the Arab peoples by the means of using Zionist policies. Israel is the occupying military power in Gaza, despite its withdrawal from the Territory, as it imposes total control. According to customary law, Israel owes protection to the occupied population. However, not only does it fail to protect it, but it has been attacking it with blockades, bombings and now a total siege since 9 October, 2023. Israeli political decisions of detaining Palestinian Resistance fighters are presented as ‚Äújudgments‚Äù, which gives the appearance of regularity. However, these are prisoners of war, whom Israel does not have the right to judge, in accordance with the 3rd Geneva Convention. Even from the point of view of the 4th Convention, the ‚Äújudgments‚Äù are illegal: trials held outside the Palestinian Territory, proceedings that do not respect fair trial. Also, the detained Palestinians are political hostages of Israel. And there are no ‚ÄúHamas hostages‚Äù, on the one hand, and ‚ÄúPalestinian prisoners of Israel‚Äù, on the other. According to the International Criminal Court, the only international tribunal empowered to deal with war crimes, Palestine is a State. In fact, the State of Palestine sits in the Assembly of States Parties to the ICC, on an equal footing with the other 122 States. Thus, the Western powers that deny the reality of the State of Palestine are at odds with themselves. Hamas affirmed its agreement with international law and its willingness to cooperate with the ICC. On the other hand, Israel rejects international law, and refuses any cooperation with the ICC. It is Hamas that is in tune with the law, and Israel that denies the law. The crimes being committed are the consequence of this denial of the law. The ICC statute defines a long list of offences, none of which refers to terrorism, as this word has always been used to discredit political opponents (De Gaulle, Mandela ‚Ä¶). Also, Hamas, which has recognised the ICC and wants to cooperate, rejects this accusation of ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù, which is a political and media concept, but not a legal one. Hamas has never been on the UN‚Äôs list of terrorist organisations. The acts committed by the Palestinian attackers on the current territory of Israel will be judged by Israel and the Western powers (procedure already opened in France). Israel will not agree to hand over its cases to the ICC. The ICC has jurisdiction because of the Palestinian nationality of the combatants, but it will apply the principle of subsidiarity: it intervenes only in the absence of proceedings conducted by national judges. Also, the line must be: 1) to challenge future Israeli judgments, since Israel refuses to apply international law; 2) to request an investigation by the ICC, as Israeli domestic law ignores international law. Hamas is waiting for the justice system to pronounce itself, but in a fair procedure and, therefore, before the ICC. When Israel initiates proceedings before its courts, the ICC Prosecutor will have to be asked to open the same investigation, demonstrating that the Israeli proceedings are serious violations of humanitarian law (Statute, Art. 8, 2, a, 6) and, thus, filing a complaint against the Israeli judges. It will be an indictment of the Israeli justice system. The possibility of a trial against resistance fighters at the ICC is unlikely, except for minor aspects. Indeed, Israel will never agree to defer to the ICC, which would force it to accept the ICC‚Äôs judgment of 5 February, 2021 that recognised the State of Palestine.

We have a new generation of Young Peacebuilders raising their voices for sustainable peace in Africa and the global community. UNSCRs (2250, 2419 & 2535), African Union Continental Framework On Youth, Peace & Security, SDGs, Agenda 2063, as well as several instruments and protocols, are platforms for young people to engage in different areas of peace policy formulation and implementation, preventive diplomacy, peace advocacy, networking, mediation and several other fields. We need a tipping point for young people's participation. Have we asked ourselves why it's so easy to mobilise young people for violence, war and not peace?

facebook,"Whether you realize it or not, you‚Äôre always in a growth process. This process is defined by the relationship between your self-awareness right now, and a new, more expanded version of yourself trying to emerge. Sometimes, the meeting of these two processes leads to an easy, liberating transformation; you sense a needed change and are able to do it. But more often, your current consciousness blocks the required change. This creates conflict, tension, and pain. If your mind can‚Äôt accept, is afraid of, isn‚Äôt ready yet, or is simply unaware of how you need to grow, it forces the basic emotion driving your growth to mutate. Instead of experiencing power or creativity or playfulness or whatever is trying to emerge into your consciousness, the raw emotion behind the new process manifests as a disturbance, a problem, a ‚Äúsymptom.‚Äù The fundamental emotion driving your issue is right, but it manifests in a negative way. Conventional mental health practice misses the mark by just trying to suppress your pain‚Äîthe disturbing manifestation of your process. Doing so, throws out the baby with the bathwater. Instead, you must learn how to reverse the mutation, uncover the hidden emotion driving your feelings, thoughts, and actions. This leads to liberation and expansion‚Äîthe true purpose of your problems. Just trying to get rid of your issue may reduce discomfort but it kills your growth. Your problem is your process! Behind your nasty inner critic, impossible relationship, depression, anxiety, attention deficit, delusions, mood swings, health issues, or boredom is an unseen emotion, a felt sense, a creative power, a new understanding and self-awareness pushing forth, trying with all its blind might to become a conscious awareness in your psyche. No matter how bad your problem is, don‚Äôt dismiss it as a meaningless error in your life, an ‚Äúillness,‚Äù a pathology to ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù and ‚Äútreat""; always keep faith and belief in that fact that it has a meaningful message, and keep working to connect with its potent, hidden emotion.

facebook,"Marschlins Castle: A Timeless Tale of Majesty and Mystery In the heart of the Swiss Alps, where the mountains kiss the sky and history whispers through the ages, there stands a silent sentinel of the past, Marschlins Castle. Its imposing stone walls rise majestically, a testament to centuries gone by. This castle, nestled within the picturesque Swiss countryside, tells a tale of grandeur, intrigue, and the souls who once called it home. A Glimpse into History Marschlins Castle, also known as Schloss Marschlins, finds its roots in the medieval period. Built in the 13th century, the castle stands as a symbol of the past, a testament to the architecture and engineering prowess of its time. Perched on a steep hill, it boasts an unassailable position with panoramic views of the surrounding Rhine Valley and the Swiss Alps. Its remarkable location makes it a sight to behold and a true marvel of medieval engineering. One can only imagine the awe of the 13th-century peasants as they gazed upon this fortress, a place they would never enter but a sight that would be forever etched in their memories. Marschlins Castle was a stronghold of power, a refuge, and a symbol of the ruling family's authority. The Hohenems, a prominent noble family of the time, constructed the castle, marking the beginning of a legacy that would span centuries. Architectural Marvel The architectural magnificence of Marschlins Castle is a sight to behold. Its formidable stone walls are a testament to the craftsmanship and engineering skills of the medieval era. The castle features a central tower that soars into the sky, offering a commanding view of the valley below. Its crenellated parapets and imposing walls add to its medieval charm. Within its walls, the castle boasts a great hall, living quarters, and chapels, all reflecting the grandeur of a bygone age. The fortress was ingeniously designed to withstand the tests of time, with thick walls and a well-conceived layout that made it impervious to siege. As visitors explore its chambers, they can't help but be transported back in time, imagining the daily lives of those who lived and ruled here. Tales of Nobility Marschlins Castle was not just a structure of stone and mortar; it was the stage for many remarkable stories, often intertwined with the noble families who called it home. The Hohenems family, who held this fortress for generations, left their mark on the history of the region. They were known for their power, wealth, and contributions to art and culture. One notable member of the Hohenems family was Kaspar von Hohenems, who lived during the late 16th century. Kaspar was a visionary and an ardent patron of the arts. He transformed Marschlins Castle into a center of culture, inviting artists, scholars, and musicians to his court. His passion for art led to the creation of exquisite frescoes that still adorn the castle's walls today, a testament to the Renaissance's blossoming in this remote Swiss stronghold. In the centuries that followed, the castle witnessed a succession of lords and ladies, each leaving their unique mark on the structure and the region. Marschlins Castle was not merely a residence but a symbol of nobility, culture, and an everlasting legacy. Mysteries and Legends Every castle harbors secrets and stories, and Marschlins Castle is no exception. It is said that beneath its sturdy foundations lies a labyrinth of tunnels that once served as escape routes, providing safe passage to the river during times of conflict. These secret passages have stirred the imagination of countless generations, and their mysteries are yet to be fully uncovered. Local legends also shroud the castle in mystery. The most famous tale revolves around a ghostly apparition that is said to haunt the castle. The spirit of a lady in white has been reported by numerous visitors and locals. Some say she is the restless soul of a lady who met a tragic fate within these walls, while others claim she is a guardian spirit, watching over the castle through the ages. Regardless of the truth, the legend adds an air of intrigue to this already captivating castle. Moments in Time While the castle has seen countless days and nights pass, some moments have left a deeper imprint in history. During the Napoleonic era, the castle was occupied by French troops. Their presence marked a significant chapter in the history of Marschlins Castle and the region. The castle's halls must have echoed with the sounds of foreign soldiers, and its walls bore witness to the turbulence of the time. Yet, it wasn't just the foreign soldiers who left their mark. Local folklore tells tales of a heroic resistance by the Swiss, who fought valiantly to reclaim the castle from the French invaders. These stories serve as a reminder of the indomitable spirit of the Swiss people and their deep connection to their land and history.

Beginning their journey on October 5, 2001, ODA 595 made their way to Uzbekistan and, on October 19, crossed into Afghanistan via an MH-47 Chinook helicopter. Here, they established contact with Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Uzbek militia. Adapting swiftly to their new environment, the team even learned to ride horses, a crucial skill. On November 10, ODA 595 and their militia allies achieved a monumental victory by liberating Mazar-e-Sharif from the Taliban. This pivotal success set the stage for subsequent Taliban surrenders across Afghanistan, marking a turning point in the conflict.

The Prince of Peace (◊©◊Ç÷∑◊®÷æ◊©◊Å÷∏◊ú◊ï÷π◊ù) came to make peace between God and sinners through his sacrificial blood, but he did so by means of a terrible conflict with the powers of darkness, and his message still offends those enslaved by pride and fear... The devil provides weapons for those in his service, namely voilence, the lies of darkness, the impudence of pride, and the vain seductions of this world, and therefore it behooves us to avail ourselves of the weapons of faith received by the agency of the Spirit of God (see Eph. 6:11-18). Be sober and vigilant because your adversary (·ºÄŒΩœÑ·Ω∑Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ) the devil prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world‚Äù (1 Pet. 5:7-8). Yield yourself to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you (James 4:7). The end of all things draws near: be awake; call upon the Name of the LORD... ¬≠ [ Hebrew for Christians ] ¬≠ ¬≠ ======== Proverbs 28:1 reading: https://hebrew4christians.com/Blessings/Blessing_Cards/prov28-1-jjp.mp3 Hebrew page: https://hebrew4christians.com/Blessings/Blessing_Cards/prov28-1-lesson.pdf ¬≠",,639,"{'like_count': 276, 'comment_count': 30, 'num_users': 179060}",Hebrew for Christians,,2023-10-19 03:15:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/293253614_498404122084701_917313411103734744_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=q-DQcZQ8VgsAX9Zv_dV&_nc_oc=AQmI6d1p70C1XeHaprVloHlO_QVSYOwROjzXBFrFt1XgT2VW2SabunJZz0L829ZxCDM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDlUPmnBd--Uc6nlvTPdfha_vXyqooV1ODizn4tQHyz-w&oe=655A0F0A,https://www.facebook.com/100057453528120/posts/786901633234947,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391588417_786901536568290_1825589584731826968_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LztN_zxvoqsAX_s9sOS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA1nb3g0Fk1wmoCbA2hCaafY0myhLRtjN-VEMv9ZpJMSA&oe=6535DF5B

Magalona, Negros Occidental, on October 17, 2023. The deceased CPP-NPA Terrorists (CNT) have been identified as Christian Job Joaquin Vargas, known as Nacio, a resident of Barangay Canlusong in E.B. Magalona, a Squad Leader of Squad 3 of the dismantled Northern Negros Front (NNF), and his wife, Mylene Malasabas Salgado, known as Iba/Shien/Ruth, a member of Squad 3 and the Regional Striking Force (RSF). Salgado is a resident of Barangay Buenavista, Himamaylan City. Christian Job Joaquin Vargas is the son of Arlo Vargas, known as Allen, one of the top leaders of the Communist Terrorist Group (CTG) in Western Visayas, who has a pending warrant of arrest for robbery in band, with a bounty of P550,000 on his head. Young Vargas also served as a former platoon leader in the Sentro De Grabidad Platoon, Central Negros 2, Komiteng Rehiyon-Negros, Cebu Bohol, Siquijor (KR-NCBS), and Central Negros 3, and a member of the Regional Operations Command (ROC). His wife, Mylene, previously held the position of political instructor in SDG Platoon, CN 2. The couple was dispatched by the Regional Operations Command (ROC) from Central Negros to reinforce the recovery efforts of the dismantled NNF. Both individuals, along with Ericson Acosta, also a top NPA Cadre and husband of Kerima Lorena Tariman, former Secretary of NNF, have existing warrants of arrest for attempted murder issued by Acting Presiding Judge Walter Zorilla of the Regional Trial Court Branch 56 in Himamaylan City. Vargas also faces multiple outstanding warrants for murder, with no recommended bail issued by the court in Kabankalan City. He is known to be involved in numerous violent incidents, including targeted killings, ambushes of both Army and police officers and civilians, and extortion activities targeting big businesses. Vargas' brother, known as Hans, Platoon Leader of Platoon 3 and Deputy of South West Front-Komiteng Rehiyon-Negros, was also killed in an encounter with the troops of the PNP's 6th Special Action Force Battalion in Sitio Balik-balik, Barangay Tabu in Ilog town in September 2021. Hans is likewise wanted for multiple murder cases. Meanwhile, 3ID Commander, Major General Marion R Sison, emphasized that this incident involving the Vargas couple is a hard truth on how the CTG destroys the very foundation of our society ‚Äì the family. First, they lure the parents, and when they do, the kids soon become easy prey. This unfortunate turn of events should serve as a strong reminder to everyone that joining the CTG leads to nothing but harm, including the destruction of families and unnecessary loss of life. For more than five decades, the CTG has brought nothing but chaos to the communities and misery to our people. It is high time that we all bring an end to local armed conflict and start building peace for our kids and future generations. ‚ÄúWe sympathize with the Vargas family for their loss. While Jocelyn vehemently denied the involvement of her son with the CTG, it can be understood and it was a normal reaction from a mother. But the fact remains that the couple were active members of the CTG. Both have arrest warrants for their participation in CTG atrocities, and their true identities were confirmed by their former comrades. These pieces of evidence were also corroborated by revelations of our informants,‚Äù MGen Sison ended. #ùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó®ùóªùó∂ùòÅùó≤ùó±ùó•ùó≤ùóπùó∂ùóÆùóØùóπùó≤ #ùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó≤ùóøùóîùóøùó∫ùòÜùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó≤ùóøùóñùóºùòÇùóªùòÅùóøùòÜ #ùó¶ùó≤ùóøùòÉùó∂ùóªùó¥ùòÅùóµùó≤ùó£ùó≤ùóºùóΩùóπùó≤ùó¶ùó≤ùó∞ùòÇùóøùó∂ùóªùó¥ùòÅùóµùó≤ùóüùóÆùóªùó± #ùóîùóôùó£ùòÜùóºùòÇùó∞ùóÆùóªùóßùó•ùó®ùó¶ùóß #ùó¨ùóºùòÇùóøùó£ùóµùó∂ùóπùó∂ùóΩùóΩùó∂ùóªùó≤ùóîùóøùó∫ùòÜ #ùó£ùóÆùóøùóÆùó¶ùóÆùóïùóÆùòÜùóÆùóª #ùóüùóºùòÉùó≤ùó±ùóØùòÜùòÅùóµùó≤ùó£ùó≤ùóºùóΩùóπùó≤ #TerroristsWorstNightmare #ùóΩùóµùó∂ùóπùó∂ùóΩùóΩùó∂ùóªùó≤ùóÆùóøùó∫ùòÜùòÄùóΩùó≤ùóÆùóøùóµùó≤ùóÆùó±ùòÅùóøùóºùóºùóΩùó≤ùóøùòÄ ùë≠ùíêùíì ùíéùíêùíìùíÜ ùíñùíëùíÖùíÇùíïùíÜùíî, ùíëùíâùíêùíïùíêùíî ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùíóùíäùíÖùíÜùíêùíî ùíçùíäùíåùíÜ, ùíîùíâùíÇùíìùíÜ ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùë≠ùë∂ùë≥ùë≥ùë∂ùëæ ùíêùíñùíì ùíëùíÇùíàùíÜ!",,623,"{'like_count': 302, 'comment_count': 48, 'num_users': 249742}",Philippine Army Spearhead Troopers,,2023-10-19 07:54:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/336888590_6256921364326531_6541009437006587378_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=N-E_NFSB56oAX_gezJr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD3F4aQK6_LppNkZ1rT7540U6iS4yH_k7ARdw5c_rmGSg&oe=655B7222,https://www.facebook.com/100064758784105/posts/718314950337125,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393805843_718314897003797_1218665964258234038_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=opAyUta5k6QAX_6m_5_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBc-OzLdPGc4dpjtC6xk_zlc2XQUlrAW6WWa20FsljauQ&oe=65368050

The tally includes a large number of women and children, with many more bodies yet to be found from the rubble. The ongoing battle sparked by the Hamas cross-border attack on Oct. 7 prompted a brutal response from a shaken Israeli nation. The results are casualties on both sides and civilians caught in the crossfire. The last blast that killed 500 in a Gaza hospital raises further the death toll, and the ending to this conflict is still nowhere in the horizon for now. üì∏Abir Sultan/EPA-EFE, Said Khatib,Mohammed Abed, Dawood Nemer/AFP",,583,"{'like_count': 95, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 607933}",Panay News,,2023-10-19 02:21:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339339715_586746643515779_5344540185653088573_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3RSm9W2ACpoAX8AJECw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCLildwcnqYdB5lh_xr4TUvlCsOZkM3bFXkNoIhFhqo5w&oe=6559BAA8,https://www.facebook.com/100064468400964/posts/716610503831223,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393795559_716610383831235_2766835384145421744_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Szem16wGTYcAX-_h5oK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCIXjSA80JF5TA79hQvgttqmWzQBCd5izsfaaBDubSSKA&oe=6539E357

facebook,"Nestled in the heart of the picturesque Aveyron region of southern France, the Chateau de Najac stands as a timeless testament to the grandeur of the medieval era. This magnificent fortress, perched atop a rugged hill, overlooks the enchanting village of Najac with an air of regal authority, casting a mesmerizing spell over all who lay eyes upon it.

Constructed in the 13th century during the tumultuous times of the Albigensian Crusade, the Chateau de Najac was not just a symbol of power but a guardian of a region rife with conflict. Its formidable stone walls, constructed to withstand sieges, rise majestically from the rocky terrain, each stone echoing centuries of history and power. 

As you approach the chateau, the very journey to its gates is an adventure through time, as you tread the very path that knights and noble ladies once walked, perhaps en route to or returning from the Crusade. 

Within the chateau's walls, the ambiance is nothing short of awe-inspiring. A tranquil courtyard, surrounded by well-preserved battlements, transports you back to the days when chivalry reigned supreme. The whispers of the wind and the echoing footsteps serve as a haunting reminder of all who have passed through these hallowed halls.

Stepping into the chateau's interiors, you are enveloped by a sense of mystery and antiquity. Stone archways lead you into dimly lit chambers where the tapestries tell stories of valor and love, offering a glimpse into the courtly life of the Middle Ages. The great hall, with its vaulted ceilings and colossal hearth, exudes an aura of grandeur that only the noblest of feasts and gatherings could have filled.

But it is from the highest tower of the Chateau de Najac that you are truly transported to another world. Ascend the winding staircase to be greeted by a panoramic vista that sweeps across the Aveyron landscape, just as it did when this fortress was both a stronghold and a refuge during its tumultuous history.

In every corner of the Chateau de Najac, you can almost hear the echoes of battles won and lost, and the whispers of lovers who once sought refuge in its walls. This medieval masterpiece is more than a monument; it is a living, breathing testament to human history, offering a profound connection to the past that is both emotive and stirring. A visit to the Chateau de Najac is a journey through time, an encounter with the spirits of chivalry, and an opportunity to lose oneself in the enchanting story of France's medieval heritage.",,572,"{'like_count': 480, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 13979}",Castles and Ruins (476 - 1700 AD),,2023-10-19 12:40:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/348560266_1637558333334973_4536405890774669832_n.jpg?stp=c13.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=P6KMt1dXWa0AX9PXC6y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCqmbynx9dLgAcrOuh0qjcJOVqw8EO8hA0XtZ-l29PL0g&oe=6559BDCF,https://www.facebook.com/groups/287988186261797/permalink/860352139025396,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391738695_618812123800739_2498417559384972345_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tpxQmRrDuxcAX9zu1b0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB4HYtxsgog_75QzLiI-lgoKFhgxbN6BlQxYAl05om0LA&oe=653724BD

facebook,"Morning Message of Motivation Dreams and Visions: 22 Rev Robert Ampiah Kwofi Initially, God spoke to men in His physical appearance in human form and later added dreams and visions. God appeared to Adam in a physical form, because Adam heard His footsteps. Genesis 3:8 NKJV ‚ÄúAnd they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.‚Äù They carried on conversations with God as with another human being. Genesis 3:9-10 NKJV ‚ÄúThen the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù So he said, ‚ÄúI heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself.‚Äù Moses‚Äô marriage created a conflict in Israel and in his family. Numbers 12:1 NKJV ‚ÄúThen Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married; for he had married an Ethiopian woman.‚Äù Moses‚Äô brother Aaron and his sister Miriam were against his new African wife but they used their problem to challenge his position. Numbers 12:2 NKJV ‚ÄúSo they said, ‚ÄúHas the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also?‚Äù And the LORD heard it.‚Äù God told Aaron and Miriam that there were levels even in spiritual gifts and graces. Numbers 12:6-7 NKJV ‚ÄúThen He said, ‚ÄúHear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream. Not so with My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My house. I speak with him face to face, even plainly, and not in dark sayings; and he sees the form of the LORD.‚Äù God made a distinction between the way He spoke to different people. Exodus 33:11a NKJV ‚ÄúSo the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend‚Ä¶.‚Äù Visions and dreams have hidden meanings, that require a God-given interpretation. Genesis 41:16 NKJV ‚ÄúSo Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, ‚ÄúIt is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.‚Äù May almighty God provide you with answers of peace to every complicated problem.

facebook,"// 7 THINGS CHRISTIANS SHOULD BELIEVE ABOUT ISRAEL VS PALESTINE // 1. All people are created in the image of God and loved by God. ""For God so loved the WORLD"" (John 3v16) 2. Christians have a special affection for Israel. God specially made them a people, gave us the Scriptures through them, brought our Savior through them, and the only reason we are saved is because we have been ""grafted into"" the promises of God originally given to them (Romans 11v17) 3. All who believe in Jesus are called in Scripture ""the Israel of God"" (Galatians 6v16) and grafted in as God's chosen people (Romans 11v17). There are people of God - Christians - in both Palestine and Israel. 4. Some have tried to frame a Hamas vs Israel conflict as ""Left vs Right."" It is not. In general terms, it is good vs. evil. 5. Hamas is an evil, terrorist organization, and there is no ""context"" that justifies what they have done in Israel. We should pray that Hamas is brought to justice and the sinful, demonic ideology beneath Hamas is fully eradicated from the world. 6. Evil never stops itself; it must be stopped. Therefore, it is appropriate for Christians to support what has been called throughout church history a ""Just War"" (articulated by St. Augustine). While individual Christians are FORBIDDEN to ""live by the sword"" or seek vengeance (Rom 12v9), governments are COMMANDED by the Bible to ""bear the sword"" (Rom 13v4) and seek justice (Rom 13v1). 7. There are people created in God's Image in Palestine and Israel that are suffering and will suffer and our hearts should break for them. Lord Jesus, we long for the day when you will return, eradicate all evil, wipe every tear from every eye, and make all things new again. Our hearts burst at the thought of worshiping around your glorious throne with redeemed people from every tribe, tongue, and nation - Israel and Palestine. Until then, we groan for that day on days like today (Romans 8:v22-25)",,551,"{'like_count': 168, 'comment_count': 74, 'num_users': 22221}",Josh Howerton,,2023-10-19 14:08:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/126032567_203301968036126_6366274720245310179_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=Oxhh1PH03qsAX9Z3Xmu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCnGp42Wo1wkhzA6FsxTAOyOP6V3kqWiN_YQwC02JF9yQ&oe=657D2B59,https://www.facebook.com/100050689710291/posts/888330552866594,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391746999_888330386199944_4663350288341172173_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NceURqm-RWEAX9H3qfg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAuA4ODR8YDlevzuyMenTkn-3XmgiTpuQi9kn7WjN76fw&oe=6557147D

facebook,"Whet Sheikh Gumi should understand is that if twins are separated at birth and adopted by a Christian and Muslim family, respectively, they will grow up and likely take their parent‚Äôs religion. That is why we must stop hating people based on their religion. People mostly don't choose their faith. It chose them. Most people are just a product of parental conditioning. That is why they say things like ‚ÄòI was born a Christian' or 'I was born a Muslim‚Äô. You were not born as an adherent of any religion. You entered this world with only one identity, which is the identity of a human being. It is on Earth you met religion. And you will leave it here. Because there is no religion in heaven except love! Sheikh Gumi's statement about not trusting Christians with Nigeria's security is regrettable and disturbing. We have come together as a country for 63 years, and this type of statement sets us back and builds distrust. We need competence and patriotism to tackle insecurity, not religious bias. Did Sheikh Gumi experience the kind of insecurity he saw in Kaduna under Nasir El-Rufai during the administration of Patrick Yakowa, a Christian? That, right there, disproves his theory. How can he think that Wike will make the FCT an extension of Israel and people with beards will be killed? That type of thinking is unfounded. Wike has no power over the Army, Navy, Air Force, or the Paramilitary Forces. Those are squarely under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, who is a Muslim, like Gumi. We have, to a large extent, successfully managed our diversity in Nigeria, and it will be most helpful if we do not allow the conflict in Palestine and Israel to cause us to hate each other. Nigeria is not Israel. Nigeria is a heterogeneous country that should serve as an example of peaceful religious coexistence to Israel if we get our acts right. #TableShaker",,545,"{'like_count': 440, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 399986}",Reno Omokri,,2023-10-19 19:13:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/367449362_10230024147125040_8537687844270499844_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jsnjMSIZrhMAX878dq5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDGGmRy1JIpZgVBQXaRGDmE38QRUCItI4Hx-KbwDdI_Lw&oe=655AB055,https://www.facebook.com/omokri/posts/10230543188260744,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393943571_10230543187860734_7059250919997763056_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=BIE4Cksh94cAX-YWgO9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB_UX2x1CInRDEfSJwFb5ZQXV_ASmgfS_aZifzh1htW2w&oe=6535AC09
facebook,"UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres made an urgent appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza on Thursday, October 19. It came a day after the U.S. vetoed the UN Security Council‚Äôs resolution for ‚Äúhumanitarian pauses‚Äù with rapid and unhindered humanitarian access. Civilians in Gaza are living in ""increasingly dire conditions"" amid shortages of critical resources, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Gaza is under a full electricity blackout for the ninth consecutive day, with dwindling food and water supplies. Even though Israel has resumed water supply to southern Gaza amid international pressure, the lack of fuel, insecurity, and road damage have made water transportation impossible in most areas. The U.S. pledged $100 million for humanitarian relief in Palestine. Human rights groups have called the crisis in Gaza a form of collective punishment for Palestinians. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to deliver weapons to Israel, and Israel has asked for another $10 billion in military aid. Israel has persisted with its bombardment across Gaza for nearly two weeks in retaliation to the Gaza-based armed group Hamas' attack in Israel on October 7.

facebook,"Canadian Inuit artist Kenojuak Ashevak, in Cape Dorset is considered the first Inuit woman to form part of the Cape Dorset recorders, draftsmen and designers cooperative, which receives support from the Canadian government.

facebook,"üîµ Charges laid following officer-involved shooting üîµ One man has been arrested and charged in relation to a shooting that occurred in September 2023. The man was arrested during an incident that resulted in an officer-involved shooting yesterday. üìç At approximately 2:45 p.m., on Saturday, Sept. 30, 2023, a driver called police to report a shooting involving two vehicles that occurred on westbound Glenmore Trail, near 37 Street S.W. Both vehicles fled the scene prior to police arrival and no injuries were reported. üìç Approximately 30 minutes later, police were called to a residence located in the 100 block of Seton Passage S.E., for reports that a man had been shot while parking his vehicle. Upon arrival, officers located one man suffering from gunshot wounds. He was transported to hospital in serious condition. It is believed that the suspect fired multiple rounds during the shooting in Seton, with stray bullets striking four surrounding residences, before fleeing the scene in a stolen vehicle. Investigators determined that these shootings were connected and worked to identify several potential suspects. It is believed that both the offenders and victim are associated to rival organized crime groups in Calgary, and that the victim was targeted due to this conflict. Given their demonstrated violence and history of court-ordered firearm prohibitions, investigators engaged the Tactical Unit to conduct the arrests of the suspects. üìç On Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2023, while attempting to arrest two suspects, an officer-involved shooting occurred at approximately 2:40 p.m., in the 5700 block of Falsbridge Drive N.E. One suspect was pronounced deceased and one police officer was transported to hospital in stable condition. A second suspect was taken into custody, and upon his arrest, officers located a loaded handgun in his possession. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding the officer-involved shooting and no additional details can be released about this incident. Today, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2023, officers executed a search warrant on the suspect‚Äôs vehicle, which resulted in the seizure of two additional loaded handguns. Photos of these firearms are included in this post. üìåThanh NGUYEN, 25, of Calgary, has been charged with one count each of attempted murder, discharge a firearm with intent, possession of stolen property over $5,000, unlawful possession of a firearm in a vehicle, unlawful possession of a restricted firearm with ammunition, possession of a weapon obtained by crime and possession of a restricted firearm contrary to a prohibition order. NGUYEN will next appear in court on Friday, Oct. 27, 2023. This investigation remains ongoing. üåê https://newsroom.calgary.ca/charges-laid-following-officer-involved-shooting/",,493,"{'like_count': 329, 'comment_count': 90, 'num_users': 180214}",Calgary Police Service,,2023-10-19 23:21:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/301156312_10160254498004530_3266450373417762411_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=-PwmsYPQ6kAAX_0UDIc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC9TmmY5wXm3c-xtdzJ0vo09Mv9AzRvresPbGXB4opddQ&oe=655A8394,https://www.facebook.com/100064515261514/posts/724215459738956,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393855068_724215079738994_1387956065642626107_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fcr_bzeqd3YAX8-1iwM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCeFDkjyAVlF5VkBCKJQPwswP5mIz_7T8EI4Dk6ieOZ4w&oe=6559FFF4

Though the family seat for Tamasese was at Vaimoso, he was apparently living at Mulinu‚Äôu at this time in an official residence following the resolution of the turbulent events of 1898-99. The death of paramount chief Malietoa Laupepa in 1898 had led to a power struggle among Tama-a-Aiga contenders for leadership, a contest that embroiled America, Germany and Britain in Samoan affairs, as all parties - local and international - tried to sort out a solution. The confused situation saw courtroom battles and armed conflict, and the eventual ascendancy of the popular Mata‚Äôafa Iosefo. At the height of this crisis Tupua Tamasese Lealofi had to seek safety on a British navy ship, where he spent several months under protection. The disturbances led directly to the German annexation of Samoa, after which Tamasese was paid an annuity and lived peaceably at Mulinu‚Äôu, in close political collaboration with Mata‚Äôafa Iosefo. Later he moved to Vaimoso where he died in 1915, apparently of pneumonia and a throat infection.

facebook,"VICE ADMIRAL GAVAN IS THE 30TH PCG COMMANDANT üáµüá≠ Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Jaime Bautista announces the appointment of CG VICE ADMIRAL RONNIE GIL LATORILLA GAVAN as the 30th Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Commandant during the Change of Command Ceremony at the National Headquarters, Port Area, Manila, today, 19 October 2023. In his speech, the Transportation Secretary expressed his trust and confidence that CG Vice Admiral Gavan would efficiently steer the PCG in implementing the ""White Hull Approach"" towards upholding maritime security and safety in the country's exclusive economic zones. ""Admiral Art was hailed for his innate peace mindset that steered the country away from any deterioration in the volatile situation at the West Philippine Sea,"" DOTr Secretary Bautista said. ""My belief that Vice Admiral Ronnie Gavan will do the same is anchored on his record of shifting to the 'White Hull Approach' when securing our maritime borders and his introduction of female radio operators, called 'Angels of the Sea,' as a way of diffusing tension during sea conflict,"" he furthered. Moreover, the Transportation Secretary emphasized President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's directives to the PCG during its 122nd founding anniversary as it moved forward to provide better public service to the Filipino nation. ""I expect the PCG to provide steadfast service and dedication to duty during times of calamity; uphold our country's maritime security and promote our maritime rights; do its part in fighting smuggling; protect our marine environment; and secure the safety of our fishermen when pursuing their means of livelihood,"" DOTr Secretary Bautista highlighted. ""The Department of Transportation firmly stands with you in your plans and efforts to improve, expand, and modernize your capabilities and services so you can level up your efforts at securing the welfare of our people and our nation,"" he concluded. President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr chose CG Vice Admiral Gavan among five recommended candidates to take over the Coast Guard helm following the retirement of CG Admiral Artemio Abu after over 35 years of public service on the same date. Before the said appointment, CG Vice Admiral Gavan served as the PCG's Deputy Commandant for Administration. He was also instrumental in training and capacity-building female Coast Guardians as radio operators dubbed ""Angels of the Sea"" on board PCG vessels patrolling the West Philippine Sea (WPS).

During the ceremony, rabbis offered prayers for peace and for the civilians affected by the war. The Israel Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines and Israeli residents in Manila joined the event. They condemned acts of terrorism and the violent actions conducted by Hamas, emphasizing that their opposition is only against the Hamas group, and not against Palestinians. According to Gaza Health Ministry, over 3,400 casualties have been reported on the Palestinian side and more than 1,400 deaths have been logged in Israel.

He is also concerned by the tensions which have arisen between different communities in the UK since the conflict escalated. King Charles made the call in a speech to the City of London as he took part in a ceremony for a new Sovereign which dates back to one of his predecessors, King William III, in 1689. He was presented with The Pearl Sword ‚Äì a gift to the City of London from Elizabeth I ‚Äì and immediately returned it to symbolise the authority of the Lord Mayor in London‚Äôs Square Mile when the Monarch is not present. Without mentioning the politics of division in the UK in recent years, like Brexit or Scottish independence or cancel culture, he did express his concerns about the fractious nature of the debate on social media and urged the country to engage in a more civil discourse.

On Tuesday, October 17, a massive explosion k!lled hundreds of people at a crowded hospital in Gaza City, which the Liverpool forward described as 'h0rrifying.' Palestinian officials say the explosion was caused by an¬†Israeli¬†Defence Forces (IDF) air strike, while officials in the Jewish state insisted it was the result of a 'failed' rocket launched by terrorist group Islamic Jihad. Salah in his message said: 'It's not always easy to speak at a time like this. There has been too much violence and brutality, the escalation in recent weeks has been unbearable to witness.'¬†¬† ''All lives are sacred and must be protected. The massacres need to stop, families are being torn apart.¬† ''What's clear now is that humanitarian aid to Gaza must be allowed immediately. The people there are in terrible conditions. The scenes at the hospital last night were horrifying.¬† ''The people of Gaza need food, water, and medical supplies urgently. I am calling on world leaders to come together and prevent the slaughter of innocent souls. Humanity must prevail.'

I‚Äôd like to walk you through that realm‚Ä¶ Mark 3:28-29 says, ‚ÄúAssuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation."" Digging the dictionary, blasphemy means great disrespect shown to God, or to something holy, or to something said or done that shows this kind of disrespect. From this, they did commit a blasphemous act, did they not? They sure will be subjected to eternal damnation, correct? Alright, let‚Äôs move forward. Drag is exaggeratedly dressing and acting as the gender that drag artists identify with or with whom they associate themselves. This is typically done for entertainment purposes such as comedy, impersonation, dancing, singing, acting, lip-syncing, or any combination of the aforementioned. In explicit terms, drag is an art‚Äî and art is free expression. So they did art, didn‚Äôt they? It was their form of expression, right? So Pura Luka Vega did both‚Äîthey blasphemed by expressing their art through drag. Then what? Let‚Äôs walk further. Here is where the most disturbing part of this aghast place, I call it the 3Is‚ÄîIronies, Inconsistencies, and I-pocrisies. First, the Ironies: the third chapter of the book of Mark talks about a conflict over healing on the Sabbath, the commissioning of the 12 Apostles, a conflict with the Jerusalem scribes, and a meeting of Jesus with his own family. Any person exposed to church activities, seminars, and workshops knows that it is unfair to use a verse or two from the Bible without purely understanding the context. Before Jesus spoke to them in parables, teachers of the law called Jesus being possessed by demons and that He was a charlatan Himself. Then He spoke those words in Mark 3:28-29, yet people who rally against PLV weaponize these verses, condemning them for their act. Yet, scrutinizing it with meticulous attention, He said that anyone who blasphemes shall be forgiven, however, anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. As Christians, we are a monotheistic religion; we believe in One God in Three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, or basically, ‚ÄúThe Holy Trinity‚Äù. However, it raises the question of why the Holy Spirit, uniquely, is singled out as the entity that shall not be blasphemed. Why is the Holy Spirit the sole exception to this rule of forgiveness? Let‚Äôs flip a few pages back in Mark 1:4. Mark makes it clear that sins are forgiven only if a person repents. This means that in verse 28 of Mark 3, it says that all sins and blasphemies will be forgiven if the person truly repents‚Äîwherein the unique and decisive role of the Holy Spirit plays a part in our salvation. When we turn away from the glory of God the Father and God the Son and embrace sin, it is therefore bad. But blasphemy against the Holy Spirit puts us beyond repentance, for it rejects the means through which an individual can seek forgiveness and turn to God. And blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is not calling Jesus names or harboring negative thoughts about Him; it is asserting that Jesus' ministry is that of the devil because he is supported by an evil spirit. As PLV‚Äôs performance only featured God the Son, are they really going to be damned forever? Did they really commit the unforgivable sin? Moving on to the next I: Inconsistencies. After being declared persona non grata from several parts of the country, PLV was arrested on October 4 for violating Article 2 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for spreading ‚Äúimmoral doctrines, obscene publications and exhibitions, and indecent shows,‚Äù with the court setting a bail of P72,000.00. What makes this inconsistent is the vagueness of their violation and the RPC itself. It was enacted in the early 1930s, which is almost a century old upon the arrest of PLV. Plus, what is more inconsistent is that Article II, Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution states that the separation of the Church and the State shall be inviolable, yet the backbone of PLV‚Äôs arrest was strongly based on Christians feeling angry about their performance. Pass√© laws and mentalities truly impede the development of a nation. It hinders us from reaching our full potential‚Äîto be at par with high-statured countries. Moving forward, Pura Luka Vega is expressing their art through this performance. Let‚Äôs talk about the setting‚Äîwere they in a church? Are they being watched by children?

Martin's comments: How to fail this essay: Write about everything that comes to your mind but ignore the word ""RELATE"" A good way to fail this essay is to choose a course titled ""MSc Entrepreneurship"" and to talk about a global issue of terrorism while choosing a CSC theme on Health. A good way to score points in this essay: Draw a connection across your course of study, the issue you want to solve (terrorism, hunger etc) and the CSC theme you have chosen.

Our government cannot run from their responsibility to these people. 200 hostages in Gaza. It‚Äôs possible, it‚Äôs necessary, it‚Äôs a must that we make every effort to free them. Around 200 men, women, and children were kidnapped into the Gaza Strip at the hands of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Every one of these hostages is a whole world, a world unto themselves. And they are all part of families and communities - parents, siblings, partners, children, friends. 200 worlds. It‚Äôs forbidden for us to give up on them. We can save Avinatan, Andrey, Segev, Almog, Ofek, Eitan, Tamar, Eden, Avigail, Rom, Vivian, Moran - we can save them and so many others. We can bring back peace of heart to so many parents, siblings, families, and friends. We can release them and we must release them. They‚Äôre trusting us. At the moment, we know almost nothing about their status, mainly because Hamas is preventing anyone from seeing them - including the Red Cross. Parents are panicking for their children who may not have their inhalers, children worried for their parents who don‚Äôt have their medicines, people on tenterhooks waiting for news on their loved one‚Äôs lives. They know that the mass-scale bombings in Gaza affect the hostages, too. We are calling on the government of Israel, on US President Joe Biden, on the countries of the world and our Palestinian counterparts - to anyone who wants to advance a political solution and work to end the occupation and the conflict - to take action to secure the peace, safety, and return of the hostages. Resistance to occupation doesn‚Äôt justify harming innocent civilians, just as Israel cannot justify harming civilians in Gaza.

facebook,"In part of our Unshaken Faith podcast episode yesterday (""How to Pray During War""), Alisa and I shared the prayer requests of a Christian mom who contacted me from Jerusalem. Several people have asked for her words to be given here in written form in order to pray with her more readily and share her requests with others. Here are the beautiful words she offered. *** Firstly, the Messianic community is praying for the salvation of Israel. We are praying that they would see the Lord is faithful and come to saving knowledge of their own Messiah. We are also praying for the salvation of our Arab neighbors. For brotherly love, and for them to have the Lord's heart for Israel, as the apple of His eye. We are praying for the IDF to safely and effectively dismantle Hamas for the good of the entire region. So much of our prayer meetings are focused on praying for the IDF, for their safety, and wisdom. For miraculous protection and discernment. We are also in prayer for soldiers in the units cleaning the villages that were massacred and they have asked for prayer for their units, as they are seeing hard and painful things. We are praying for the hostages to remain safe and to be returned to their families quickly. The Northern border is a huge concern. Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are all Iranian proxies. They all work with Iran to accomplish their evil agenda and we are praying for protection on the Northern border where the cells have more direct access to Iranian support. We are also asking the Lord to give us time to grieve, as a nation, and for the families who lost loved ones in the massacre. We went from devastation and shock to defending our nation, without properly sitting Shivah (the 7 day mourning tradition of the Jewish people). We're also all very tired. Please pray for the civilians to be able to rest and sleep well. We're all working really hard in a variety of volunteer capacities and the adrenaline let downs from the sirens are exhausting. We are a nation of overwhelmed people right now and we need to rest. Hope. Please pray for hope and that the Israeli people will see the Lord and be aware of his comfort after this loss. The propaganda war is very stressful for us as well. The left/woke ideology hates everything God loves, including Israel. It's really hard to see truth twisted, and Israel presented as an oppressor. We are constantly praying for the nations to know what is Truth, what is true, and what is factual. Our army is the most heavily scrutinized in the world and we go beyond what is required to ensure ethical processes. We are dealing with people who make that very difficult. Endurance. We don't know how long this mission will take and we need to endure in the Lord, in healthy and holy ways. Wisdom about decisions big and small, whether its when and where to go to the grocery store, or if/when to evacuate. (So far our entire community of friends is still here. No one has left). Pray for the moms who are now single parenting after the husbands left for reserves. Pray for them to get the rest and help they need from the community. Please pray for the children to be shielded from trauma, both in lived experiences and images in the media. Many of our friends who were here for the Gulf war as children said it increased their faith, so there are ways this can be a positive as long as we keep their needs at the forefront. *** Thank you all for praying alongside this mom and so many like her who are in the middle of the conflict. If you'd like to leave her a word of encouragement, please do so in the comments and I will share with her.",,371,"{'like_count': 89, 'comment_count': 33, 'num_users': 27500}","Natasha Crain, Author and Speaker",,2023-10-19 17:05:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/131893028_226327162193966_3812234983103840630_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=P7iis3xF0tUAX8Dvl5t&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCEPGzJNLJjFu8Pd4SZiDevIIUw7aNFYhGwupS62TaFSg&oe=657D136E,https://www.facebook.com/100044500508474/posts/850653596427983,

The man who operated the Akbhar Sain Supermarket at the lower flat of his Williamsburg, Corentyne Berbice home, was beaten to death at around 2:00 hours by Satesh Ramneries. The suspect, who confessed, said after he broke into the establishment, a scuffle ensued between Akbhar and him, during which he hit the man with a piece of wood to his head. After the lashes, Akbhar collapsed and died. Neighbors who heard the incident contacted the police, and they rushed to the scene. Police said the suspect was seen hiding behind a washing machine in the back verandah in the upper flat of the businessman's two-storey house. The police challenged him, and he received a shot in the right arm. A search was conducted on his person, and a quantity of Guyana currency was found stashed in his crotch. The suspect was escorted to the Port Mourant Public Hospital, where he was seen by a doctor on duty. At the time of the incident, Akbhar was living alone. His gun was found at the scene. The suspect remains in custody as police continue their investigation. Meanwhile, the now-dead man's cousin, Zamin Djamier told the Guyana Daily News that Akbhar operated the supermarket for decades. ""He was a very hardworking person; a man who never rest. He was all for his family and a very decent person. He have never been in conflict with anybody, "" he said. Djamier continued, ""It pains me to know that an individual who had given his all, would have been having his demise in this way. The entire family is being shattered. I spoke with his brother who lives in New York and his next brother who lives in Canada and nobody can come to grips with what has happened here this morning.

facebook,"Proverbs Chapter 17

‚ÄúBetter a dry crust eaten in peace than a house filled with feasting‚Äîand conflict. A wise servant will rule over the master‚Äôs disgraceful son and will share the inheritance of the master‚Äôs children. Fire tests the purity of silver and gold, but the Lord tests the heart. Wrongdoers eagerly listen to gossip; liars pay close attention to slander. Those who mock the poor insult their Maker; those who rejoice at the misfortune of others will be punished. Grandchildren are the crowning glory of the aged; parents are the pride of their children. Eloquent words are not fitting for a fool; even less are lies fitting for a ruler. A bribe is like a lucky charm; whoever gives one will prosper! Love prospers when a fault is forgiven, but dwelling on it separates close friends. A single rebuke does more for a person of understanding than a hundred lashes on the back of a fool. Evil people are eager for rebellion, but they will be severely punished. It is safer to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than to confront a fool caught in foolishness. If you repay good with evil, evil will never leave your house. Starting a quarrel is like opening a floodgate, so stop before a dispute breaks out. Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent‚Äî both are detestable to the Lord. It is senseless to pay to educate a fool, since he has no heart for learning. A friend is always loyal, and a brother is born to help in time of need. It‚Äôs poor judgment to guarantee another person‚Äôs debt or put up security for a friend. Anyone who loves to quarrel loves sin; anyone who trusts in high walls invites disaster. The crooked heart will not prosper; the lying tongue tumbles into trouble. It is painful to be the parent of a fool; there is no joy for the father of a rebel. A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person‚Äôs strength. The wicked take secret bribes to pervert the course of justice. Sensible people keep their eyes glued on wisdom, but a fool‚Äôs eyes wander to the ends of the earth. Foolish children bring grief to their father and bitterness to the one who gave them birth. It is wrong to punish the godly for being good or to flog leaders for being honest. A truly wise person uses few words; a person with understanding is even-tempered. Even fools are thought wise when they keep silent; with their mouths shut, they seem intelligent.‚Äù",,362,"{'like_count': 116, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 564004}",I Am A Child Of GOD,,2023-10-19 09:38:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/219594010_104575838581015_3812837893676643678_n.jpg?stp=c5.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=DC0_DMbjZXcAX837p3n&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB9Vq90u5zRVCC8V5xT47MPvG_WbAt7rrL304acL33URg&oe=6559E568,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1099643823708166/permalink/2167269916945546,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393018003_6990035811048407_2660157609848935788_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3crmcCC745EAX_Rfj0-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA_t4SViIq6AJhaKE-uYD8mt3_2s1W4xVrF-prOzpT94Q&oe=6535B7E3

facebook,"ArchAngel Michael's Discourse~ ( Ronna Herman Vezane) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è We will now help you build your Pyramid of Power, where you will go in your quiet time and sleep time to receive healing, nurturance ‚Äî to create that which you desire, and to also seek a Divine Solution for any situation or challenge that you may face. In whatever way you perceive, envision a Pyramid of Light. Through your intent, state that this pyramid is manifested in the fifth dimension. There is a capstone on your pyramid and it contains a spiraling Rainbow Ray of Light, which contains all the colors, virtues, and attributes of our Father/Mother God. As you move into the interior of your pyramid, look around: the walls and floor radiate an inner Light, and there are twelve crystal chairs in a circle. (You may wish to add more from time to time.) There is a Crystal Table in the center, and when you lie on it, it conforms perfectly to your body. There is a magnificent clear quartz crystal hanging over the center of the table. The crystal is faceted at both ends and the upper portion penetrates the capstone of the pyramid. This is the basic structure of your pyramid. However, we suggest that you add your own personal touches as you visit your Sacred Temple, and make it your own. We will give you several examples of how you may most effectively use your pyramid. Healing Conflict with Another Let us say that you have a situation of conflict with someone in your life. In a meditative state, go into your Sacred Pyramid; be seated in one of the crystal chairs, and envision the other person sitting across the room from you, with the Crystal Table in the center. Ask the Higher Self of the person to join you two, as you wish to have a dialog with this person. Please, place your ego in the passive mode, and speak from the heart with your Soul as the director. Objectively state your case. And then place the situation on the Crystal Table, asking for a Divine Solution with the highest outcome that serves you both. Envision the Violet Flame of transmutation blazing up from beneath the table, surrounding the situation as it balances and harmonizes the energies within the thought-form/situation. Now, see the Great Crystal hanging over the Crystal Table begin to glow, and streams of Golden Light flow forth (they will look something like your strikes of lightning that you see in the skies during a thunderstorm). First, these streams of Lightning will focus on the Crystal Table and the situation. Then they will spread out to each of you, as they eventually fill the room. You will have tapped into the energy of the Divine Source. And you, the other person, and the situation will be charged with the cosmic Life Force of Creation. Then, you must relinquish the outcome to the wisdom of Spirit. You must switch to autopilot, you might say, whereby you cannot know where you are going or what the exact outcome will be, but trusting that it will be of the highest order. Healing Ourselves If you wish to focus on your physical vessel ‚Äî an illness, or an imbalanced situation ‚Äî place yourself on the Crystal Table. State your desire, which may be specific or just for a general tune-up. Ask your Higher Self or I AM Presence to be your cosmic facilitator and oversee the process as the Violet Flame blazes up and surrounds you, and then the beams of Lightning are activated. This will greatly enhance and speed up the process of releasing any residual impacted negative energies within the physical structure, and building your vessel of Light. You will find that you will not be allowed to place anyone else on your Crystal Table without their permission (or, in special cases, the permission of their Higher Self). Decision-Making and Manifestation Spend time within your Pyramid of Power when you have a decision to make, and to solidify and energize your visions and aspirations. Here, you may use the Universal Laws of Manifestation in their most dynamic form as you become proficient as a Master of Co-Creation. Spend time clarifying your vision of the future in all areas: spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical. ... Apply [your understanding of the laws of manifestation] within your Pyramid of power, and watch as the miracles unfold. If there is a group situation ‚Äî say, within the family or the workplace ‚Äî see everyone involved seated in the crystal chairs and place the situation in the center. Ask each person's Higher Self to stand behind and oversee the process. Again, place the situation on the Crystal Table, envisioning and asking for the highest outcome for all. Ask for the Divine Solution. And then spend as much time as necessary focused on the energy of the situation. See the Violet Flame magically neutralize it, and the Lightning of Spirit transform it into its highest form. At times you may wish to be in your Pyramid of Power by yourself, and at other times you may expand it to any size you wish, as you bring in great numbers of people and situations, both large (truncated)",,360,"{'like_count': 118, 'comment_count': 46, 'num_users': 46366}",Adama & His Guidance Into The Higher Dimensions,,2023-10-19 06:49:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/274377213_5426778024019599_8383716697662111421_n.jpg?stp=c0.7.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Gy3ujkQYhlQAX8wRwgZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD3xGG7RSaMMddwZTpm_mMxa2kP_qnc4iXpKAcMnneYyQ&oe=6559F655,https://www.facebook.com/groups/123152701107372/permalink/6859876887434886,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391576216_7316137471750302_624055900328234925_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tZIa7JWcXcwAX_U9c_h&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfACeJFVNgd_E9U5rpCuocQEKrMXyKJGsZalnH1BId48Zw&oe=65367D80

facebook,"PRESS RELEASE BANJUL ‚Äì 19th October, 2023 - The Government of the Republic of The Gambia joins the International Community including United Nations (UN), Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), The African Union (AU) and others in vehemently condemning the Israeli Military operations in Gaza for almost two weeks including stoppage of electricity, water, food aid, medical supplies, fuel and the indiscriminate bombing of Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza where over 500 innocent Palestinians were killed mostly women, children, the disabled and sick patients. Taking into cognizance the fact that Palestinians have for long been fighting for their legitimate and inalienable rights for self-determination for over 75 years without any success; and given the usurpation of their territories and freedoms by the Occupying Power, the State of Israel, their situation became so dire that utter desperation resulted in this unfortunate war in Gaza. The Government of The Gambia calls for an unconditional ceasefire and the release of all hostages to prevent more bloodshed and the proposed invasion of Gaza which could result not only in more deaths and destruction but also in forcibly displacing Palestinian citizens in Gaza and the West Bank and in doing so build more Israeli settlements in those areas. The Government of the Gambia further appeals to the International Community to compel the Occupying Power to abide by the tenets of the Peace process, International Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Security Council Resolutions. Failure to do so is bound to prolong the conflict, cause further instability and diminish the chances fora resolution of this conflict. The Government of The Gambia, given that Israeli Military aggression is used as an instrument of collective punishment causing huge loss of life, property and injuries on both sides since the occupation of Palestine in 1948, calls for an International Peace Conference for a permanent and durable solution to this very protracted Palestinian problem. The Government of The Gambia considers that: the best option for a peaceful settlement of this dispute between the two parties is not a military one but a comprehensive Peace Accord based on the ""Two-Party Solution"" guaranteeing both States their legitimate and inalienable rights to full sovereignty and self-determination. The Government of The Gambia, in this context, reaffirms its support for the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate national rights, as recognized by the International Community through its recognition of a State of Palestine within the borders of June 4th, 1967, with Al-Quds Al- Shareef as its Capital as indicated in all relevant UN, OIC and AU Resolutions. On behalf of H.E. The President of the Republic of The Gambia Mr. Adama Barrow, The Government and People of The Gambia express deepest condolences for the tragic loss of life and property on both sides and wish all those injured speedy recovery and pray that this tragedy which continues to unfold before our own eyes will soon cease and never be repeated again.",,345,"{'like_count': 233, 'comment_count': 46, 'num_users': 87418}",State House of The Gambia,,2023-10-19 20:50:34,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/240663389_1603889153276519_4410914831979127520_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XfAii_V5g_EAX_8125z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCv2NX5xmYJCMhGMnoITXGS2vgB8Vnfg17XX0tcMorCRg&oe=655B6A1D,https://www.facebook.com/100066962874627/posts/652948100280613,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392931538_652947746947315_4061117955519156644_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=R1u93JRsgzQAX_njq6f&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAJ3UQhLSvCFZG9O5ZGYmSywyBh8ErQsO23XRFCyAzhBA&oe=6555184E

facebook,"UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres made an urgent appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza on Thursday, October 19. It came a day after the U.S. vetoed the UN Security Council‚Äôs resolution for ‚Äúhumanitarian pauses‚Äù with rapid and unhindered humanitarian access. Civilians in Gaza are living in ""increasingly dire conditions"" amid shortages of critical resources, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Gaza is under a full electricity blackout for the ninth consecutive day, with dwindling food and water supplies. Even though Israel has resumed water supply to southern Gaza amid international pressure, the lack of fuel, insecurity, and road damage have made water transportation impossible in most areas. The U.S. pledged $100 million for humanitarian relief in Palestine. Human rights groups have called the crisis in Gaza a form of collective punishment for Palestinians. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to deliver weapons to Israel, and Israel has asked for another $10 billion in military aid. Israel has persisted with its bombardment across Gaza for nearly two weeks in retaliation to the Gaza-based armed group Hamas' attack in Israel on October 7. Civilians remain the most impacted by the ongoing conflict. #GazaCrisis #UnitedNations #AntonioGuterres #UNResolution #Israel #Palestine #usa #GazaSiege #Palestinians #humanitariancrisis",,324,"{'like_count': 183, 'comment_count': 26, 'num_users': 121062286}",CGTN,,2023-10-19 22:44:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/240501168_398442308315914_1975708148483497397_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fqFJPm2ePcQAX_EttAj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmpHfEtK6PszswEM-kc4fo5ZDurnAeUaRWl6uD79W1bw&oe=655A1719,https://www.facebook.com/100044504436603/posts/973892034104269,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392941026_717618853746060_551710791609918633_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hYT1e5ClG00AX--Rgk9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAUVjUNYs4RbsGIl6bGwUddKSfTlM_3dGYAkEIdz5bp9w&oe=6539386E

facebook,"In times of global turbulence, like the unsettling conflict we're witnessing in Israel, it's easy to become a little more on edge, a little less patient. But it's precisely during these trying moments that the power of kindness radiates even brighter, cutting through the darkness. Remember, everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about. A smile, a kind word, or just a listening ear can be a beacon of hope in someone's stormy sea. Kindness doesn't just warm the soul of the recipient; it's the spiritual kindling that ignites a fire in your own heart, making the world a bit more luminous for all.

Without giving details, the Authority reported that Israel has evacuated several of its embassies in the Middle East, including the embassies in Bahrain and Morocco. The Israeli Authority further stated: ‚ÄúThe embassy in Jordan was evacuated at the start of the war by the order of the Foreign Minister, Eli Cohen, and the Ministry‚Äôs Director-General.‚Äù The conflict in Gaza, under Israeli bombardment and blockade since 7 October, began when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, a multi-pronged surprise attack that included a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel by land, sea and air. It said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers. The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.

facebook,"EXAMPLES OF HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH AN ALIENATED CHILD Staying assertive and setting boundaries Firstly, remember to pick your battles and ""strike when the iron is cold."" There is no point trying to converse with a heated angry child or teen. Find a time when they are hopefully calmer and preferably not in earshot of the alienating parent. Here are some examples you can play around with... üåªWhen it comes to defining expectations: ""We can have a productive conversation when we both speak respectfully. If you raise your voice or make hurtful comments, I will disengage from the conversation until we can talk calmly."" üåªWhen entitlement issues are a concern: ""I hope that when we spend time together, we can share our thoughts respectfully and consider each other's feelings. Our interactions need to be a positive experience for both of us."" üåªPutting a limit on finance entitlement: ""I genuinely want to help with your needs to the best of my ability, but it's important that we discuss and agree on what's reasonable and practical within my financial budget."" üåªWhen privacy is an issue: ""I highly value my privacy. Please respect my personal space and belongings as you would want yours to be respected. üåªWhen you need to promote more respectful communication: ""Having good conversation happens when we're both kind and respectful in our words. If things start to feel too intense or if someone says something unkind, it would be a good idea for us to pause the conversation and chat again when we're both feeling calmer."" üåªWhen time spent with you is an issue: ""We've talked about the special times we've set aside to be together, which means a lot to me. It can be disappointing when you don't join me at the agreed times, especially when I have planned..."" HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH YOUR CHILD SPENDING TIME WITH YOU OR YOUR FAMILY: * Let them know you understand that they might have mixed feelings about family time. * Talk about all the fun and happy moments you've had together as a family, like holidays, birthdays or when you laughed a lot. * Explain that families are like a team. They help each other in good times and when things get tough. Being together helps you all stay strong. * Families give each other love and care. When you spend time together, it makes your love even stronger and helps you understand each other better. * Always remind them that you love them very much. Being with them helps you both feel even closer to each other. * Let them know it's okay to share their thoughts and feeling and that you will always be there to listen. * Talk about all the exciting things you'll do together as a family in the future. It's something to be excited about! * Explain everything in a way they can easily understand, using simple words and examples they can relate to. * Remember, it might take some time for them to fully understand why family time is important. Be patient and keep being kind and supportive. * By being a part of family activities and showing that you enjoy spending time together, you're teaching them how important family is. #communication #alienatedchild #conflict #boundaries Photo credit: Orlando Allo on Unsplash",,264,"{'like_count': 133, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 13788}",Amanda Sillars,,2023-10-19 00:14:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/284108150_483809403530495_2999158800337076083_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xzkVZg936rwAX8V-j-X&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCqkZOTXFWNQY3kMp73rlEh2nYVfgC7qJ9PpdtU03_tOQ&oe=6559CC2C,https://www.facebook.com/100057043191339/posts/858536636057768,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393686754_858532682724830_3403110644056360786_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6xhf1mNNglIAX9quVb7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBkJCE5C6rF7UFB0w0sbdoxwdbP81IWgUIdIGkrBvUSaw&oe=6535E2C9

facebook,"BERT HARDY Londra, 13 maggio 1940. Il Regno Unito √® in guerra contro la Germania nazista. In un discorso alla Camera dei Comuni il primo ministro Winston Churchill annuncia che il paese si trover√† nel mezzo di un grande calvario cui √® possibile uscire solo con ‚Äúsangue, sudore e lacrime‚Äù. I bombardamenti che seguiranno devastano Londra ma non la piegano. Il calvario, con annessi orrori, √® raccontato da un fotografo autodidatta, un documentarista che ha saputo accreditarvisi e che ha preso a seguire i movimenti delle truppe in guerra, a partire dallo sbarco degli Alleati in Normandia. Il suo nome √® Bert Hardy (1913-1995). Nelle fotografie che propongo alla vostra attenzione Hardy racconta la fase post-bellica di un paese fiero e colmo di speranzosa fiducia che proviene dall‚Äôessere uscito vittorioso da un conflitto che ha incendiato l‚ÄôEuropa, ma i cui segni dell‚Äôorrore sono impressi nel morale di tutti come un graffio indelebile. A esclusione delle prime fotografie, che rimandano al periodo della viva minaccia bellica ‚Äì vediamo infatti un folto numero di bambini in procinto di allontanarsi da Londra per essere messi in salvo nelle Contee fuori Londra, quale garanzia di un futuro ‚Äì tutte le altre appartengono al periodo della ricostruzione, in un arco temporale che va dal ‚Äô48 al finire degli anni ‚Äô50. Londra vuole dimenticare e ripartire. Non sar√† facile e in ogni scatto di Bert Hardy cogliamo l‚Äôatmosfera confusa di quegli anni, alla quale concorre una spessa coltre di nebbia a rendere un orizzonte ancora pi√π sfumato. Da l√¨ a pochi anni cambier√† tutto, una ventata di novit√† costringer√† ogni Britannico, specialmente i giovani, a guardare al futuro con maggiore fiducia. Saranno gli anni dei Beatles e della ‚ÄúSwinging London.‚Äù E conosciamo come √® andata. Ma la Londra di Bert Hardy, ‚Äúquella‚Äù Londra, ha un assoluto valore testimoniale. Le sue fotografie, tutte scattate rigorosamente con la sua fedelissima Leica, sono pi√π efficaci di un saggio e dalla cui lettura ricaviamo un affresco drammatico e bellissimo. Che si tratti di bambini al gioco, di chiacchiere di vicine, di donne intente alla lettura o di prostitute gravitanti intorno a Piccadilly Circus si respira un‚Äôaria di restituzione del sociale di grande efficacia. Di Bert Hardy si dice che ¬´nessuno ha mai raccontato meglio il Regno Unito a cavallo della Seconda guerra mondiale¬ª e che ¬´se Londra potesse scegliere che occhi offrirsi vorrebbe quelli di Bert Hardy¬ª. E poich√© il Regno Unito √® un paese che non dimentica nessuno dei figli che l‚Äôhanno resa grande, una targa apposta sull‚Äôuscio della casa ne ricorda l‚Äôimperitura memoria, consegnando Bert Hardy nell‚ÄôOlimpo dei padri della fotografia. Giuseppe Cicozzetti foto Bert Hardy BERT HARDY London, May 13, 1940. The United Kingdom is at war with Nazi Germany. In a speech to the House of Commons, Prime Minister Winston Churchill announces that the country will find itself in the midst of a great ordeal that can only be left with ""blood, sweat and tears"". The bombings that followed devastated London but did not bend it. The ordeal, with attached horrors, is told by a self-taught photographer, a documentary filmmaker who has been able to accredit him and who has taken to following the troop movements in war, starting from the Allied landing in Normandy. His name is Bert Hardy (1913-1995). In the photographs I propose to your attention, Hardy recounts the post-war phase of a proud and full of hopeful country that comes from having emerged victorious from a conflict that has set Europe on fire, but whose signs of horror are etched in everyone's moral like an indelible scratch. Except for the first photograph, which refers to the period of the living war threat - we see in fact a large number of children about to leave London to be saved in the Counties outside London, as a guarantee of a future - all the others belong to the period of reconstruction, in a time span ranging from '48 to the end of the 50s. London wants to forget and starting over. It will not be easy and in every shot of Bert Hardy we catch the confused atmosphere of those years, to which a thick layer of fog contributes to make an even more nuanced horizon. From there, in a few years everything will change, a wave of novelty will force every Brit, especially the young, to look to the future with greater confidence. They will be the years of the Beatles and of the ""Swinging London‚Äù. And we know how it went. But the London of Bert Hardy, ""that"" London, has an absolute testimonial value. His photographs, all taken rigorously with his loyal Leica, are more effective than an essay and from whose reading we derive a dramatic and beautiful fresco. Whether it's children playing, neighbors chatting, reading women or prostitutes gravitating around Piccadilly Circus, you can breathe such an air of great social restitution. It is said of Bert Hardy that ¬´no one has ever told the United Kingdom better at the turn of the Second World War¬ª and that ¬´if London (truncated)",,252,"{'like_count': 169, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 46236}",Scriptphotography,,2023-10-19 09:10:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/290484336_403789058452036_3001975211706096675_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=S4DZ6GI4ZBYAX-tOZxr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBIQ2dnCApMZDHMi7kivwwC-aaGTuMHolw0gkUTntwhCg&oe=655AC738,https://www.facebook.com/100064628355237/posts/740017728162499,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393815919_740016054829333_1733797554093009202_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QuuXKdelj5cAX9JcLU2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA4RlslEs9r2RVHshBHCY4te3BafSbJ36NkppYURGLxAQ&oe=65359DEE

facebook,"In Solidarity With Rights Of The State And People Of Israel To Self Defense And In Condemnation Of The Rising Defenseless Citizens‚Äô Casualties And House And Other Property Destructions In The City Of Gaza (Part 1) ‚Ä¶a Land (of Judea) flowing with milk and honey is again flowing in blood and tears under the fumbling and wobbling UN -Intersociety Onitsha, Eastern Nigeria Thursday, October 19, 2023 The International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety) is in strong solidarity with Right of the State and People of Israel to defend themselves against any internal and external aggression particularly their collective right to self-defend themselves and their properties such as territories, homes and public institutions and facilities at all times. That is to say that the Oct 7, 2023 coordinated terrorist attacks by Hamas and other allied terror groups and their sovereign backers are totally and strongly condemned. The attacks which mowed down not less than 1,400 Israelis including 286 soldiers and other nationals including 31 Americans and terminally injured 3,400 defenseless Israelis and others are unspeakably reprehensible and nothing short of a replication of the cannibalistic and barbaric era of the ‚ÄòSaladin (Salah ad-Din ibn Ayyub: 1174D-March 4, 1193AD) of Egypt‚Äô during which POWs and ‚Äòenemy children‚Äô, captured from the Third Crusade were dismembered and fried like bean-cakes. The Hamas jihadist attacks also led to abduction of between 199 and 250 Israelis who are being held hostage. Saddening and shocking was the large scale magnitude perpetration of property destructions on the side of the State and innocent citizens of Israel. Totally Condemning The Rising Civilian Casualties Involving Innocent Palestinians In Gaza The rising civilian casualties and property destructions in the City of Gaza are totally unacceptable and strongly condemned. They are also nothing short of ‚Äòreprisal radicalism and crudity‚Äô perpetrated outside the confines of ‚Äòmilitary necessity‚Äô and a clear breach of the ‚ÄúGeneva Conventions of August 12, 1949 (Laws of the War) and its 1977 Protocols (1 and 11) which the State of Israel must have ratified as a ‚Äò49th Member-State of the United Nations on May 12, 1949‚Äô. The Four Geneva Conventions have clearly laid down procedures for Inter-State and Intra-State Armed Conflicts under the Doctrines of ‚Äúthe Jus In Bellum‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Jus Ad Bellum‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Jus Post Bellum‚Äù as well as the ‚ÄòPrinciples of Use of Force, Proportionality of Force and Legitimate Self Defense‚Äù are incorporated. The Geneva Conventions had also in 1977 received additional two ‚ÄúProtocols 1 and 11‚Äù for purpose of strengthening the protection of civilian and property victims of the International Armed Conflict (Inter-State) and Non-International Armed Conflict (Intra-State) and placement of limits on the way wars are fought. Among them are prohibition of attacks on civilian homes and religious centers and symbols and protection of civilian populations, journalists and humanitarian aid workers, etc in situations of Inter-State or Intra-State armed conflicts. Others are prohibition of acts of torture, starvation, etc. The City Of Gaza Must Not Be Reduced To ‚ÄúThe City Of Tents‚Äù The leaders of the State of Israel including its war planners and policy makers must refrain from turning the City of Gaza into Rubbles or Tents‚Äù. Since the Israeli Intelligence Services are one of the most sophisticated and respected in the world, time has come for them to locate and spot the exact locations where the Israeli hostages and the enclaves of the Jihadist Hamas and Hezbollah are located including whether the Israeli hostages are being held ‚Äúwithin the sovereign or outside sovereign territories of Israel and those of its adversaries‚Äù. The exact location of such places using ‚ÄúMan-Mental-Machine Intelligence and Investigations‚Äù is extremely important so as to protect and save the innocent Palestinian population and their homes from further attacks and destructions. It is also extremely important for the leaders of Israel not to limit their searches to ‚ÄòPalestinian territories‚Äù alone as it is possible the hostages have been taken to the territories or hideouts of those bankrolling the Hamas and the Hezbollah. Where credible intelligence available to the leaders of Israel shows that the hostages are being held in tunnels or surface enclaves located in civilian populated areas controlled by Palestinians, their exact locations should be ascertained and effective safety measures for civilians and their homes put in place before any rescue operation. Same methods should be applied if secret locations of the Jihadist Hamas and their allies‚Äô hideouts are traced to civilian populated areas including deployment of electronic and manual intelligence detection and tracking. In all, the 2,750 defenseless Palestinians killed so far and 9,700 others wounded as well as over 1m IDPs generated in Gaza and environs and property (truncated)",,246,"{'like_count': 134, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 68975}",Chinasa Nworu,,2023-10-19 11:55:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/351327433_1455046381991250_3995447340690822199_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ecxplc_LQawAX98Gppr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfADVsoMr7MngQHiVZMjL4OKpCrprn7Z_k-hvqhNP3yAAg&oe=6559C9CF,https://www.facebook.com/100034617184190/posts/1095781404919089,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393961162_1095781291585767_2744052551393112591_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Bsxzf9b-U-MAX_RUjsA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDDIhHxV1eucNYumvsH3YhNjlNs-C1TXC6vvVVHxcgMzw&oe=6535F942
facebook,"Inzamam-ul-Haq, the former Pakistan cricket captain, is reportedly considering stepping down from his role as chief selector due to disagreements with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Sources suggest that Inzamam is dissatisfied with the appointment of Shahid Anwar as the head coach of the U19 men's team, as he had advocated for former Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Yousaf to be given the position. This is not the first instance of conflict between Inzamam and the PCB, as they have had differences in the past as well. Recently, Inzamam had signed a contract worth Rs2.5 million per month with the PCB. However, the PCB has refuted these claims, with a spokesperson stating that Inzamam had actively participated in the selection process for the U19 men's team and the women's A team, and they had no knowledge of any discord between Inzamam and the board. Earlier in the month, Inzamam was appointed as the chairman of the Junior Men's Cricket Selection Committee, adding to his existing responsibilities as the head of the senior selection committee. The senior selection committee includes Tauseef Ahmed, Wajahatullah Wasti, and Wasim Haider, while the junior selection committee consists of Aamer Nazir, Javed Hayat, Mahmood Hamid, Naveed Latif, Salman Ahmed, and Sanaullah Baloch. In a separate development, former captain Mohammad Hafeez recently announced his resignation from the PCB Technical Committee via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), expressing his gratitude to chairman Zaka Ashraf and conveying his best wishes to Pakistan cricket.

facebook,"The news created shockwaves around the world. Those evil, genocidal Israelis bombed a hospital in Gaza, resulting in hundreds of deaths. And this was not just a hospital caring for the sick and the wounded. It was a hospital where civilians were taking cover, including many children. Yet these monstrous Israelis targeted it for destruction, causing outrage and cries for vengeance around the globe, especially in the Muslim world. Of course, that‚Äôs not what happened. First, Israel doesn‚Äôt do that. Israel does not target hospitals and schools. Israel does not single out and destroy innocent non-combatants, especially women and children and the sick and elderly. And especially, at a time like this, Israel would not possibly do something like this. The backlash would be massive, and rightly so. In stark contrast, Hamas does do these very things. Hamas takes delight in slaughtering the innocent in the most grotesque, barbaric ways imaginable, filming it for the world to see. Israel does not. So, at the very worst, this would have been an errant strike by an Israeli pilot, a tragic event that would cause grief and pain in Israel as well, not dancing and celebrating in the streets. (For those with very short memories, there was dancing and celebration in Gaza over the wholesale butchering of innocent, non-combatant Israelis.) And even if this was an errant strike by the IDF, the fault would still lay at the feet of Hamas since they instigated the war and since they use civilians as human shields. But this was no errant strike by the IDF. All evidence points towards it being a failed rocket launched by the Islamic Jihad, as the terrorists slaughtered their own. Visual evidence points to this. Audio evidence points to this. Satellite imagery evidence points to this. Foreign intelligence analysis points to this. Unfortunately, none of this will matter to the critics of Israel, who are now raging with indignation against the Jewish state. The story has already been canonized and the lie has already become truth. Any attempts to set the record straight will be branded ‚Äúfake news‚Äù or ‚ÄúIsraeli cover up‚Äù or the like. Yes, the enemies of Israel now have definite proof that Israel is genocidal, and this false allegation, in turn, will lead only to more bloodshed ‚Äî both Jewish and Arab ‚Äî in the years ahead. In my 1992 book Our Hands Are Stained with Blood: The Tragic Story of the Church and the Jewish People (updated and expanded in 2019), I document many of the lies that have been told about the Jewish people in history (it seems the crazier the lie, the more it is believed). I also document many examples of libelous reporting, falsified claims, and extreme media bias. A photo was released by United Press International on August 2, 1982, during the heat of the Israeli-PLO conflict in Lebanon. According to Frank Gervasi (in the book The Media‚Äôs War Against Israel): ""The photo showed a 7-month-old Lebanese girl swathed in bandages from head to foot. The caption that accompanied the picture said the child had lost both arms and had been severely burned in the ‚Äúaccidental bombing‚Äù of an apartment house in East Beirut by the Israeli Air Force. Outraged, President Reagan put in a personal telephone call to Premier Begin urging him to suspend the Israeli bombing of PLO targets in West Beirut, using the word ‚Äúholocaust‚Äù in the ensuing exchange."" Naturally, this touching photograph received front-page coverage everywhere, making the Israelis look like cold¬≠ blooded killers. Just think of their brutal, indiscriminate attack on helpless civilians! Unfortunately, while the media was quick to focus on the Israeli Defense Forces‚Äô mistakes, (they made their share of mistakes in Lebanon), the media was slow to report the rest of the facts. Gervasi tells us that after Reagan‚Äôs phone call, the Israeli authorities: ""made a thorough investigation, and on August 22 released a photo of the same child after treatment. The infant had not lost both arms and had suffered no burns and only slight injuries to the wrists. Moreover, the baby, it turned out, was not hurt by an Israeli bomb but by a shell from a PLO battery in West Beirut. The UPI confirmed that the original caption was inaccurate and expressed regret. But whereas the original photo was splashed everywhere, the corrected version barely made the inside pages."" We‚Äôve heard this story before, and we are hearing it again today. And sadly, once again, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel bias counts more than truth. The real tragedy with the bombing of the hospital is not just that Israel will be falsely blamed and that, worldwide, there could be acts of destruction and hatred, with Jews especially targeted. No, the real tragedy is that right now, when all of us should be mourning this terrible loss of Palestinian life and working together to stop the bleeding, both metaphorically and literally, we are expending our energy refuting the lies promoted by the murderers of Israeli babies and (truncated)",,235,"{'like_count': 106, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 584527}",Dr. Michael Brown,,2023-10-19 21:38:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/277796022_8004303829595149_3444591915280965641_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Ru1mboltmokAX85vEBc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBr7RPctAt2juc7rna8G3TF5a39wqXQpKLV0vphFe2lSQ&oe=655A3969,https://www.facebook.com/100064522336853/posts/710131661147572,

facebook,"Saya telah menyampaikan Kenyataan Malaysia dalam Mesyuarat Luar Biasa Tergempar Jawatankuasa Eksekutif Pertubuhan Kerjasama Islam (OIC) Peringkat Menteri-Menteri Luar Negeri berkenaan serangan ketenteraan rejim Israel yang berterusan ke atas rakyat Palestin. Dalam Kenyataan ini, saya telah menggesa konflik Palestin-Israel dihentikan dengan kadar segera dan mendesak untuk menghentikan politics of dispossession, iaitu menyahkan hak dan tanah rakyat Palestin. Negara Anggota OIC, masyarakat antarabangsa dan negara-negara yang berpengaruh perlu mencari solusi ke arah ini. Saya juga telah menggesa masyarakat antarabangsa untuk menyokong pembukaan laluan kemanusiaan (humanitarian corridor) untuk menyampaikan bantuan kemanusiaan kepada rakyat Palestin. Mesyuarat ini telah menerima pakai satu dokumen hasil yang mengutuk sekeraskerasnya pencerobohan Israel terhadap Palestin. Dokumen ini juga menggesa agar pencerobohan Israel dihentikan serta-merta; pengepungan yang dikenakan ke atas Semenanjung Gaza oleh Israel ditamatkan; dan menyeru negara-negara dan masyarakat antarabangsa untuk menghulurkan bantuan kemanusiaan segera kepada rakyat Palestin. Malaysia turut mengecam secara serius insiden pengeboman Hospital Al-Ahli Al-Arabi di Utara Gaza, sehingga menyebabkan banyak kematian termasuk wanita dan kanak-kanak serta orang awam yang tidak bersalah. Perbuatan kejam ini jelas sekali bertentangan dengan nilai kemanusiaan dan melanggar undang-undang antarabangsa. Sebagai salah sebuah negara pengasas OIC, Malaysia terus komited dalam memperjuangkan hak-hak rakyat Palestin. Malaysia bersedia untuk bekerjasama dalam mana-mana usaha antarabangsa bagi mengumpul dan menghulurkan bantuan kemanusiaan secepat mungkin kepada rakyat Palestin. Malaysia juga sedang giat mengadakan perbincangan dengan pemimpin-pemimpin dunia bagi mencari kaedah terbaik untuk menghentikan konflik yang berlaku dan mencari penyelesaian masa kini dan masa hadapan rakyat Palestin agar lebih aman dan selamat. ------------------ I delivered Malaysia‚Äôs statement at the Extraordinary Emergency Meeting of the OIC Executive Committee at the level of Foreign Ministers to discuss the ongoing Israeli military aggression against the Palestinian people. In my statement, I stressed the need for the Israeli regime to cease the ongoing politics of dispossession, that is denying the rights and land of the Palestinian people. OIC Member States, the international community, especially States with influence need to find a solution in this direction. I also urge the international community to support the opening of humanitarian corridors to ensure the unhindered flow of aid to the Palestinian people. The meeting also adopted a Final Communique, strongly condemning the unprecedented Israeli aggression against civilians. The Final Communique also stressed, among others, the immediate cessation of the Israeli aggression against the people of Palestine; the immediate lifting of the siege imposed on the Gaza Strip; and called upon countries and the international community to extend the immediate provision of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people. In the latest incident, Malaysia also seriously condemned the bombing of the Al-Ahli al-Arab Hospital in Northern Gaza, causing many deaths including women and children as well as innocent civilians. This brutal act is clearly against human values and does not comply with international law. As one of the founding members of the OIC, Malaysia remains committed to the Palestinian cause. Malaysia is prepared to participate in any international efforts to provide humanitarian aid and relief supplies to the Palestinians. Malaysia is also actively holding discussions with world leaders to find the best way to stop the ongoing conflict and to find a present solution for the sake of a more peaceful and secure future for the Palestinian people. #wismaputra #doczam #MalaysiaMadani #oicmeetingforpalestinians",,228,"{'like_count': 104, 'comment_count': 32, 'num_users': 112955}",Zambry Abd.

facebook,"(Manchester United news) üíöüíöJadon Sancho has been urged to apologise to Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag, or risk being booted out of Old Trafford in January.‚öΩÔ∏è The player and manager have been at loggerheads ever since Sancho bit back at Ten Hag‚Äôs claims that he was left out of the squad for Man United‚Äôs defeat at Arsenal on September 3 due to his lack of performance in training.‚öΩÔ∏è The conflict at Man United between Ten Hag and Sancho shows no sign of letting up 3‚ñ∂Ô∏è The conflict at Man United between Ten Hag and Sancho shows no sign of letting up Sancho has since been exiled from the first-team, training with the Under-18 side and is understood to not even be allowed to eat with his teammates at Man United‚Äôs training ground at Carrington.üíØ But talkSPORT understands an apology to Ten Hag would bring him back into the fold. talkSPORT reported last month that Marcus Rashford were among Sancho‚Äôs teammates telling him to swallow his pride and issue the apology to the Dutchman. And this appears to still be going on with the Guardian reporting that senior players are desperate for the forward to say sorry. However, talkSPORT reported last week that although they want Sancho to apologise, Man United players are ‚Äòdisgusted‚Äô by Ten Hag‚Äôs treatment of the 23-year-old, as well as club legend Cristiano Ronaldo, who left the club for the second time in acrimonious circumstances last season. If Sancho‚Äôs apology isn‚Äôt forthcoming then it seems the only option will be for him to be sold. A return to Borussia Dortmund, who sold him for Man United for ¬£73million in the summer of 2021 has been mooted.‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è #manchesterunitedsuppotersnews #unitedforthefans #PremierLeague #GGMU #MUFC #ManUtd",,223,"{'like_count': 186, 'comment_count': 30, 'num_users': 12551}",Manchester united supporters news,,2023-10-19 01:59:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/400135755_819650266525770_772989650914055599_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=FF6tmBHdGtYAX8TR5-s&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBdy9ruMz-YJnL3g7kVylJq_uQHW6XYheU5cEyhFs6E0A&oe=655AE7DF,https://www.facebook.com/100054424122250/posts/809883000835830,https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393940750_809881704169293_5282820993002055728_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=E3U8uIICPKcAX9JKwxi&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AfATcnudIT1plQ4l3xaHmeXSJx8UthNPFCOFKT3qW_84ew&oe=65348EB7
facebook,"Director of Congressional and Public Affairs Josh Paul resigned from his position at the U.S. State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Political-Military Affairs on Wednesday, citing the U.S decision to boost lethal arms transfers to Israel as ‚Äúshortsighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values we publicly espouse.‚Äù In his resignation letter, Paul declined to remain a part of an administration he fears is repeating the ‚Äúsame mistakes we have made these past decades.‚Äù News of Paul‚Äôs resignation from the State Department on a moral basis, after 11 years of employment in U.S. arms transfers to allies and Middle Eastern countries, was picked up by U.S. publications large and small. Paul told the New York Times that continuing to give Israel what he called a green light to ‚Äúkill a generation of enemies, only to create a new one, does not ultimately serve the United States‚Äô interests.‚Äù In the interview Paul also cited the lack of any debate around the decision to continue sending arms to Israel, as well as no oversight mechanisms and no pushback from Congress - still operating without a House Speaker on Thursday- as further reasons for his decision to resign. The U.S. State Department did not comment on the resignation, citing its policy on discussing personnel matters. Israeli airstrikes on Gaza continued Thursday across the entire territory, including in areas in the south that Israel had declared as ‚Äúsafe zones,‚Äù AP reports. Israel‚Äôs bombardment of Gaza is response to the Hamas attack in southern Israel almost two weeks ago that killed more than 1,400 people. Hamas is still holding at least 203 captives.

facebook,"IN PHOTOS | Pagdiriwang ng Katutubong Pamayanan Higaonon ICCs/IPs - Practitioners of Traditional Conflict Resolution The word Higaonon came from the words higad, meaning ‚Äòcoastal areas,‚Äô gaon, meaning ‚Äòmountains,‚Äô and onon, referring to the ‚Äòpeople.‚Äô They were originally called by outsiders as Higadnon, which means ‚Äòseaside dwellers.‚Äô Over time they were then called Higaonon when they were forced to move uplands as they chose peace over conflict when the settlers and the colonizers arrived during the Spanish period. By continuing to practice husay or traditional conflict resolution, the Higaonon managed to sustain peace within their community. The Higaonon of Caraga are descendants of Apo Nangadinag, one of the descendants of Apo Pabuloson, who is one of the main ancestors of the Higaonon of Northern Mindanao. Apo Nangadinag is an Alagaan priestess who wanted to achieve salvation as promised by the spiritual bird Andadapal found in Sinakungan, the mountain believed by all Higaonon as holy, where they celebrate the Dumalongdong. The ancestral domain of the Higaonon in Caraga Region is located in the forested interior planes and mountainous areas of Esperanza, Agusan del Sur and in the municipalities of Las Nieves, Buenavista, Nasipit and Carmen, in the Province of Agusan del Norte. The Higaonon can also be found in three provinces in Northern Mindanao, specifically in Bukidnon, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Oriental. #BuwanNgKatutubo #protectipra #BagongPilipinas @followers Friends",,219,"{'like_count': 84, 'comment_count': 12, 'num_users': 7663}",Allen Capuyan,,2023-10-19 03:30:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/326563410_974751566825533_4070965224455835673_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=clybYUVfRp8AX8qzgyN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCcFlSPl5Da-QdTOIDi9s3KVDsNn8r_HF8wU-VMqATKHQ&oe=655AB0A3,https://www.facebook.com/100064159237617/posts/714025587412743,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393654710_714025684079400_1620211150663070735_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=556JjIe6ZI4AX9ZjojP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD6377duPaJnjBX4L1Ci0V7vdhPJnNs9CQJTwZzEhSwng&oe=653789A2

These are men that fails in their responsibility with United Nation to handle the issue of Palestine and Israel and settle the dispute amicable. They are the reason the world today is not a better place, they want you and I to make choice so their enemy will be our enemy. Israel is not my enemy neither is Palestine my enemy.

facebook,"Tupua Tamasese Lealofi I, c.1902-05

Tupua Tamasese Lealofi and the scientist, Otto Tetens, who took this photograph, formed a close friendship after Mr Tetens arrived in Samoa in 1902 and set up the observatory at Mulinu‚Äôu, Apia (click image for full height).

Tamasese lived nearby and Tetens often breakfasted with him. Lealofi, the son of Titimaea, was a handy tufuga fai fale and he and his daughters assisted the German scientist with fale construction, making and fitting roof thatching and blinds, pola, for some of the buildings that housed observatory equipment. Tetens diary recounts that Tamasese‚Äôs daughters sometimes came to get water from his tank using empty coconuts as containers.

Though the family seat for Tamasese was at Vaimoso, he was apparently living at Mulinu‚Äôu at this time in an official residence following the resolution of the turbulent events of 1898-99. The death of paramount chief Malietoa Laupepa in 1898 had led to a power struggle among Tama-a-Aiga contenders for leadership, a contest that embroiled America, Germany and Britain in Samoan affairs, as all parties - local and international - tried to sort out a solution. The confused situation saw courtroom battles and armed conflict, and the eventual ascendancy of the popular Mata‚Äôafa Iosefo. At the height of this crisis Tupua Tamasese Lealofi had to seek safety on a British navy ship, where he spent several months under protection.

The disturbances led directly to the German annexation of Samoa, after which Tamasese was paid an annuity and lived peaceably at Mulinu‚Äôu, in close political collaboration with Mata‚Äôafa Iosefo. Later he moved to Vaimoso where he died in 1915, apparently of pneumonia and a throat infection.

facebook,"Excerpt from ""US Warmongers Keep Pushing The Narrative That Hamas Is To Blame For All Deaths In Gaza"": One thing I‚Äôve been meaning to highlight for the last few days is the way US warmongers have been forcefully pushing the propaganda narrative that Hamas bears 100 percent responsibility for all deaths in Gaza, and Israel bears zero percent, as Israel ramps up its mass slaughter of Palestinians. In a New York Times article titled ‚ÄúHamas Bears the Blame for Every Death in This War,‚Äù notorious neoconservative war propagandist Bret Stephens argues that no blame whatsoever should be placed on Israel for the thousands of civilians it has killed in its latest Gaza operation and the thousands more it will continue to kill. ‚ÄúThe central cause of Gaza‚Äôs misery is Hamas,‚Äù Stephens writes. ‚ÄúIt alone bears the blame for the suffering it has inflicted on Israel and knowingly invited against Palestinians. The best way to end the misery is to remove the cause, not stay the hand of the remover.‚Äù Lindsey Graham (who is such a bloodthirsty psychopath that he recently called on Israel to ‚Äúlevel‚Äù Gaza because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in a religious war here‚Äù and said the US should bomb Iran any time Hamas executes any prisoners) echoed Bret Stephens‚Äô sentiments during an interview on Monday. ‚ÄúEvery death going forward I blame on Hamas, not Israel,‚Äù Graham said. Graham‚Äôs senatorial colleague Mitt Romney was even more direct. ‚ÄúYou are going to see pictures of Palestinian civilians that are going to be injured, killed by virtue of the conflict, which is ongoing,‚Äù Romney said during an appearance in Tel Aviv. ‚ÄúI hope you recognize that those individuals are being killed because of Hamas, not because of Israel.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are using Palestinians to protect Hamas lives,‚Äù Romney added. ‚ÄúTherefore, when Israel takes action to try and go after Hamas and take out its leadership, there will be civilians and innocents that will be killed. They will parade that as if this is some horror perpetrated by Israel.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not forget the lives that you will see lost on TV‚Ä¶ Israeli lives and Palestinian lives [lost] are all the result of Hamas,‚Äù Romney continued. Fox News war slut Sean Hannity shares the same opinion, surprise surprise. ‚ÄúEvery single death in this conflict can be blamed on Hamas and their supporters in Iran,‚Äù Hannity told his audience. ‚ÄúBecause of last week‚Äôs brutal terror attack, Israel has no choice. They must defend their country.‚Äù",,198,"{'like_count': 98, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 61776}",Caitlin Johnstone,,2023-10-19 13:40:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/124096426_208230794005506_6130403264090968181_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=iVkJc8HaJJUAX_EGoSb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDg9AcwjrEU2_M0yEuCehFLrcEkhAkWyJe9BjgzoVPm8w&oe=657D2FA8,https://www.facebook.com/100044557594666/posts/874830387345540,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/16180083002763977099?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstackcdn.com%2Fimage%2Ffetch%2Fw_1200%2Ch_600%2Cc_fill%2Cf_jpg%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep%2Cg_auto%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F1b83aa32-82e5-45c5-a5d2-54d4d14d9771_1024x683.jpeg&fb_obo=1&utld=substackcdn.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbGynKtMX1sksb6YztAuu7KtkdAtfvby2ZIze20WEO9U_A&oe=6532FDB5

If you‚Äôre not clear on where you want to go TOGETHER, you'll drift apart. Plan your goals together, both business + personal. We have a weekly mastermind together every Sunday morning to stay aligned & communicate what's working Vs. What's not. 2. Avoid Stubbornness. It's a relationship killer. When we disagree (almost daily, lol), we strive for win-win outcomes ASAP. The magic of your life lies in what you‚Äôre thinking but not saying. ^Read that again Moralüëá Clear the air. Keep moving forward! 3. Understand your partner's point of view before opening your mouth. This will expand your awareness & make you an all-around better human. 4. Know each other's schedules. We share calendars so we know what we're up to. This helps with planning & time management. 5. Conflict is normal. Avoiding conflict is unrealistic & will set you up for failure. When things get boring or frustrating (which they will) - communicate it. Don‚Äôt sit & complain. Do something about it! We love a good debate, lol. It helps us understand each other + always has a silver lining that serves us. 6. Men, pick up your boxers & socks always or prepare to meet DOOM! 7. Give your partner time to think, have fun, & recharge by themselves. These serve as breathing spaces. I go shooting and fishing, don‚Äôt look at my phone for hours on end. Claire likes to do CrossFit, shop, and go out with the girls. Strategic time + space apart is important. 8. Never piss off one of the sisters, lol. 9. Dial in your social circle. Get in the proximity of role models & interesting couples doing great things. Be ruthless with who you let into your circle. 10. Date night every week. The first thing I plan every week is fun.

facebook,"OPINION: Congratulations FNB Eswatini and all workers for reaching an agreement on 6.5% salary increment,dialogue is the solution. BY ZWELI MARTIN DLAMINI Swaziland News,19th October 2023 It is commendable to note that, the negotiations between the First National Bank(FNB) Eswatini and the Swaziland Union of Financial Institutions Allied Workers Union(SUFIAWU) yielded positive results. FNB is a reputable bank, it was not in the interest of this brand to see workers protesting in demand of a salary increment hence the reported arrogance and reluctance by the Management was a threat to the reputation of the financial institution‚Äôs brand. Workers are the engine of this brand, despite being technologically advanced, the FNB systems are developed and controlled by human resources. FNB Chief Executive Officer(CEO) Dennis Tikhalo Mbingo acted in the public interest by reaching an agreement with the workers,customers were getting worried and this is a bank that impacts people‚Äôs lives. In the midst of any conflict, it‚Äôs always commendable to receive information suggesting that, an agreement has been reached and peace has been restored. This means more energy will now be directed to production and/or development of more services for customers instead of a strike action. http://www.swazilandnews.co.za/fundza.php?nguyiphi=5383",,195,"{'like_count': 160, 'comment_count': 12, 'num_users': 292767}",Swaziland News,,2023-10-19 11:17:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/340016522_3624244121192402_2821608837216487211_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=9Ypr8Ifk84QAX-VcauO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCtlqGDLH1rCrbgi5hZj1FLQXA89H6C4Jx3kO7rviSUyQ&oe=655B468F,https://www.facebook.com/100063537552369/posts/805208854940359,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394083359_805207508273827_5834414318328137521_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=AgH0VfzumFEAX8QNkji&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAFyXqu5G9SgoaGTVfJqu9rjiWF4KSVGQczzyAFnL3U7g&oe=653559D9

facebook,"Julia Margaret Cameron (British photographer) 1815 - 1879 Hypathia, 1868 albumen print, on a gilt-ruled mount 32 x 24.8 cm. (12.63 x 9.75 in.) signed, titled, and annotated 'From Life' and ‚ÄòMarie Spartali‚Äô by the photographer and with the Colnaghi blindstamp on the mount (Cox 469) private collection ¬© photo Sotheby's Hypatia was an Alexandrine Neoplatonist philosopher in Egypt who was the first well-documented woman in mathematics. As head of the Platonist school at Alexandria, she also taught philosophy and astronomy. As a Neoplatonist philosopher, she belonged to the mathematic tradition of the Academy of Athens, as represented by Eudoxus of Cnidus; she was of the intellectual school of the 3rd century thinker Plotinus, which encouraged logic and mathematical study in place of empirical enquiry and strongly encouraged law in place of nature. According to the only contemporary source, Hypatia was murdered by a Christian mob after being accused of exacerbating a conflict between two prominent figures in Alexandria: the governor Orestes and the Bishop of Alexandria. Kathleen Wider proposes that the murder of Hypatia marked the end of Classical antiquity, and Stephen Greenblatt observes that her murder ""effectively marked the downfall of Alexandrian intellectual life"". On the other hand, Maria Dzielska and Christian Wildberg note that Hellenistic philosophy continued to flourish in the 5th and 6th centuries, and perhaps until the age of Justinian. Source: Wikipedia * * * After receiving a camera as a gift, Julia Margaret Cameron began her career in photography at the age of forty-eight. She produced the majority of her work from her home at Freshwater on the Isle of Wight. By the coercive force of her eccentric personality, she enlisted everyone around her as models, from family members to domestic servants and local residents. The wife of a retired jurist, Cameron moved in the highest circles of society in Victorian England. She photographed the intellectuals and leaders within her circle of family and friends, among them the portrait painter George Frederick Watts, the astronomer Sir John Herschel, and the Poet Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson. She derived much of her subject inspiration from literature, and her work in turn influenced writers. In addition to literature, she drew her subject matter from the paintings of Raphael, Giotto, and Michelangelo, whose works she knew through prints that circulated widely in late nineteenth-century England. Summing up her influences, Cameron stated her photographic mission thus: ""My aspirations are to ennoble Photography and to secure for it the character and uses of High Art by combining the real and Ideal and sacrificing nothing of the Truth by all possible devotion to Poetry and beauty.""

THEME: Stay on the High Road GENESIS 26:12 When Isaac planted his crops that year, he harvested a hundred times more grain than he planted, for the LORD blessed him. My dear listener, in Genesis 26, Isaac was living among the Philistines in a time of great famine. He stepped out in faith and sowed seeds despite the drought, and God blessed him with a hundredfold harvest. He became a wealthy man, with large flocks of sheep and great herds of cattle. He was blessed so abundantly that the Philistines became jealous. All was well with the Philistines until Isaac‚Äôs business took off. They first clogged up Isaac‚Äôs wells, then the king told Isaac he had to move because he was too powerful. Isaac could have argued, could have started a fight, but he understood that with the blessing comes persecution. He kept his peace, moved on, and God brought him into a better place. When God brings blessings on your life, someone will be jealous and try to stir up trouble. Stay on the high road. Don‚Äôt pay attention to the criticism of small-minded people. When you refuse to get bent out of shape, nothing can keep you from the abundance that belongs to you. PRAYER ‚ÄúFather, thank You for the promise to bless me right where I am, even when I face opposition and ridicule. I believe that You will multiply me even in the midst of famine.

facebook,"‚ù§ On this day - 4th October 1841 ‚ù§
.
‚ù§ Birth of Maria Sophie Amalie - Naples Warrior Queen  ‚ù§

.
‚ù§ Born on 4th October 1841 to Duke Maximilian of Bavaria and Princess Ludovika, Maria Sophie Amalie had a privileged but turbulent childhood.
While she was born in the lap of luxury, her upbringing was very extraordinary due to her father‚Äôs eccentric ways.
The Duke encouraged his family to take up habits like horse riding, instead of reading and studying.
Needless to say, he imparted his sense of adventure onto his children, especially Maria Sophie.

‚ù§ At just 16 years of age, Maria was betrothed to Francis II, the Crown Prince of Naples.
Unfortunately, Maria still hadn‚Äôt gotten her period.
Since marriages were about siring royal heirs as quickly as possible, this posed a very big problem for Maria.

‚ù§ To try and remedy the situation, poor Maria was subjected to a brutal medical regime aimed at jumpstarting her period cycle.
From scorching hot baths to leeching, the young girl underwent various procedures.

‚ù§ Maria and Francis were a match made in hell, because they were polar opposites in personality and temperament.
While Francis was serious and devout, Maria was young, playful, and adventurous, which didn‚Äôt translate well into their bedroom activities.
As the tale goes, their wedding night comprised of Francis desperately praying, while Maria wept.

‚ù§ As it turns out, Maria wasn‚Äôt the only one with troubling medical conditions.
Francis was also hiding a shameful secret from everyone.
The prince suffered from a condition called Phimosis, which made intercourse incredibly painful.
This wholly blindsided young Maria, and their marriage suffered greatly as a result.

‚ù§ The marriage went from bad to worse with Francis‚Äô  ailment, and their incompatibility.
The prince naturally failed to meet his young wife‚Äôs appetites.
In fact, their marriage wasn‚Äôt consummated until years later, due to Francis‚Äô condition.

‚ù§ Barely a year after her nuptials, Prince Francis‚Äô father passed away, making him the King of Two Sicilies.
Overnight, Maria became a literal Queen.
While her queendom wasn‚Äôt as luxurious as one would hope, it allowed Maria to prove herself to the people of Europe and beyond.

‚ù§ Becoming a Queen of the Two Sicilies did Maria no favors.
By the time she got married to Francis, the Kingdom was already on shaky ground.
A quiet but deadly revolution had been bubbling under the surface, and in 1860, it finally arrived at their doorstep.
Needless to say, they were not prepared for it.

‚ù§ As enemies laid siege to the Kingdom, Francis‚Äô took a passive stance on the whole conflict.
Her husband‚Äôs spineless antics came as a shock to the bold and fiercely loyal warrior Queen.
Instead of taking charge, Francis started having panic attacks, and Maria was left to take care of the mess.

‚ù§ As the enemy troops slowly took over the Kingdom, Maria and Francis retreated to Gaeta with their men.
The seaside castle of Gaeta was far away from the dangers of Naples, and provided Francis with a sense of safety.
However, Maria was more intelligent than that, and knew that the incoming storm would mark the death of their empire.

‚ù§ Instead of relying on her good-for-nothing husband, she decided to take matters into her own hands and ended up on the front lines.
She rallied the troops, and cared for the wounded, earning the people's respect.
Beyond being brave, Maria was also full of mischief and wicked humor.
Once, in order to distract an approaching enemy fleet, she ordered her men to moon them with their bare bottoms!!

‚ù§ Maria Sophie‚Äôs enemies begrudgingly admitted her greatness.
One of her biggest rivals, Gabriel D‚ÄôAnnunzio, once referred to her as a ‚Äústern little Bavarian Eagle.‚Äù
Her horse riding lessons ended up serving her well in battle, as she fought alongside her people.
Not only that, but Maria also wielded a sword, as if she was born to be on the battlefield.

‚ù§ Tales of Maria‚Äôs fearlessness and tenacity in the face of war, spread all over Europe.
She was considered such a warrior queen, that she earned the flattering title ‚ÄúThe Modern Joan of Arc.‚Äù
That‚Äôs an impressive feat for a 19-year-old girl.

‚ù§ Despite Maria‚Äôs sacrifices on the battlefield, The Kingdom of Two Sicilies crumbled on 20th March 1861.
Maria and Francis escaped to Rome in peaceful exile, but this was only the beginning of the warrior queen‚Äôs incredible journey.

‚ù§ While they were exiled in Rome, Maria gave into temptation and committed the ultimate sin.
A handsome Belgian officer captured her heart.
In 1862, Maria discovered the consequences of giving in to her passions.
The queen was carrying her lover‚Äôs child, and she couldn‚Äôt even pass it off as the royal heir.

‚ù§ Maria‚Äôs influential family got wind of the brewing scandal, and immediately sprung into action.
The former queen was transported to the German palace, and it was agreed that Maria would secretly give birth to the baby.
Maria gave birth to her illegitimate daughter on 24th November (truncated)",,189,"{'like_count': 158, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 304691}",–°–û–ö–†–û–í–ò–©–ê –ú–ò–†–û–í–û–ô –ñ–ò–í–û–ü–ò–°–ò,,2023-10-19 04:24:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/365083311_260641346816645_4996678332057178239_n.jpg?stp=c33.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=X5b1Sl06wswAX_M0Uof&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDObr5bABBPcR7hGghJYRR9cL5QWcezM_B4r2ry1UXhRA&oe=655A010A,https://www.facebook.com/groups/378349403036377/permalink/1472339913637315,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386620607_838028461300242_5718223468042857543_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ltnbXbgnbi4AX99UBJt&_nc_oc=AQngqt2Xk3QXMlSvnRimIkIDU7b-scYFXgVaW-2VAYtJ40JsbV8knMnrhgOg_I1oqRM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCqUoPNrm7aCa18KNXXeHzwU1ML6XJjso0dZfUb3DvABA&oe=6536021B
facebook,"üáÆüá±ISRAEL √Æn RƒÇZBOI ‚Äì Actualizare ‚Äì Joi, 19 octombrie.

Buna seara prieteni -
AceastƒÉ actualizare vƒÉ va transmite c√¢teva dintre sentimentele »ôi ideile prezentate dupƒÉ vizita lui Biden, o sintezƒÉ a zilei .

At√¢t prim-ministrul Marii Britanii, cancelarul german c√¢t »ôi premierul nostru au fost aici.
Pe mƒÉsurƒÉ ce intrƒÉm √Æn a 13-a zi a acestui conflict chinuitor, situa»õia continuƒÉ sƒÉ evolueze rapid, iar provocƒÉrile cu care ne confruntƒÉm devin mai descurajante.
 
üòìOstatici »ôi victime:
NumƒÉrul israelienilor confirma»õi cƒÉ au fost rƒÉpi»õi »ôi »õinu»õi √Æn Gaza a crescut la 205, dintre care 40 de copii. √éncƒÉ nu »ôtim situa»õia lor. P√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent, existƒÉ √ÆncƒÉ aproximativ 250 de persoane neidentificate, familiile lor sunt √ÆncƒÉ √Ænntr-un stres infernal. Unii dintre cei dispƒÉru»õi necunoscu»õi ar putea fi √Æn via»õƒÉ √Æn Gaza, iar al»õii ar putea fi printre mor»õii care a»ôteaptƒÉ sƒÉ fie identifica»õi. ImagineazƒÉ-»õi doar angoasa incredibilƒÉ a familiilor care NU au cuno»ôtin»õe despre soarta celor dragi.
 
AdevƒÉrul despre atacul asupra spitalului din Gaza este rezolvat. Dar retorica de a da vina pe Israel pentru acest ‚ÄûMasacru‚Äù are ecou √Æn Cisiordania, Iordania, Egipt »ôi alte »õƒÉri pe care vrem sƒÉ le implice √Æn solu»õionarea situa»õiei dificile a palestinianului. Niciunul dintre ei nu vrea sƒÉ primeascƒÉ refugia»õi nici mƒÉcar temporar. üò¢ü§Ø
At√¢t UE, c√¢t »ôi Israelul au estimat cifrele la c√¢teva zeci, nu 470‚Ä¶

ü§µüèªVizita lui Biden 
a fost uimitoare prin sprijinul, cƒÉldura »ôi √ÆmbrƒÉ»õi»ôarea familiilor ostaticilor »ôi a kibutzimului (ceea ce este mult mai mult dec√¢t a fƒÉcut sau face guvernul nostru). Cererea lui (pe c√¢t de justificatƒÉ este) de a aduce sprijin umanitar popula»õiei civile palestiniene, mul»õi cred cƒÉ este prematurƒÉ. Re»õinerea unei anumite asisten»õe este o p√¢rghie pentru ob»õinerea de informa»õii despre situa»õia ostaticilor. √éi vrem √Ænapoi »ôi inten»õia este *nu de a crea o crizƒÉ umanitarƒÉ* ci de a continua presiunea mondialƒÉ asupra Hamas pentru a face ceea ce este corect. Nimic din toate acestea nu se √Ænt√¢mplƒÉ »ôi ajutoarele vor √Æncepe sƒÉ vinƒÉ prin grani»õa cu Egiptul cƒÉtre popula»õia care a pƒÉrƒÉsit teritoriul Hamas din Gaza.
 
√éncep sƒÉ aparƒÉ idei de alinare, dar nu putem implica UNRWA dupƒÉ ce a permis ca Hamas sƒÉ fure peste 5000 de galoane de combustibil din depozitele lor. Biden ne-a dat undƒÉ verde (»ôi aceasta este inten»õia noastrƒÉ) sƒÉ intrƒÉm √Æn Gaza »ôi sƒÉ distrugem instala»õiile subterane ale Hamas. Acestea includ sute de mile de tuneluri, centre de comunica»õii, arsenale, ateliere de rachete, centre cibernetice, posturi de comandƒÉ militare »ôi multe altele. Numai ‚Äûghetele pe pƒÉm√¢nt‚Äù le pot distruge. SUA au avut aceastƒÉ experien»õƒÉ √Æn timpul primului rƒÉzboi din Golf, √Æn care mii de tone de bombe nu au putut elibera Kuweit sau captura Sadam Hussein p√¢nƒÉ c√¢nd nu au trimis trupe. Israelul ar trebui sƒÉ evacueze trupele de √ÆndatƒÉ ce treaba este terminatƒÉ. Cine va intra la guvernare? Nu poate fi ONU, deoarece vedem cum √Æi permit Hezbollah -lui din Liban sƒÉ arunce cu rachete in Israel.  »òi da, ei observƒÉ »ôi raporteazƒÉ la sediul ONU din New York.
 
Vor reuni Egiptul, SUA, Arabia SauditƒÉ »ôi »õƒÉrile europene o for»õƒÉ interna»õionalƒÉ care va intra p√¢nƒÉ c√¢nd palestinienii vor crea o conducere civilƒÉ autenticƒÉ care sƒÉ preia controlul?

Israelul ia mƒÉsuri decisive. Zeci de site-uri militare Hamas din F√¢»ôia Gaza au fost vizate. C√¢teva dintre conducerile militare »ôi politice le-au √Ænt√¢lnit deja pe ‚Äûcele 72 de fecioare‚Äù ca »ôahid.

üöÄAtacuri cu rachete:
Barajul de rachete nu dƒÉ semne de diminuare. Acum ne confruntƒÉm cu aproximativ 350 de rachete zilnice lansate asupra popula»õiei civile din Israael. Av√¢nd √Æn vedere arsenalul estimat al Hamas de p√¢nƒÉ la 30.000 de rachete, ne pregƒÉtim pentru atacuri sus»õinute √Æn sƒÉptƒÉm√¢nile urmƒÉtoare.

Magalona, Negros Occidental, on October 17, 2023. The deceased CPP-NPA Terrorists (CNT) have been identified as Christian Job Joaquin Vargas, known as Nacio, a resident of Barangay Canlusong in E.B. Magalona, a Squad Leader of Squad 3 of the dismantled Northern Negros Front (NNF), and his wife, Mylene Malasabas Salgado, known as Iba/Shien/Ruth, a member of Squad 3 and the Regional Striking Force (RSF). Salgado is a resident of Barangay Buenavista, Himamaylan City. Christian Job Joaquin Vargas is the son of Arlo Vargas, known as Allen, one of the top leaders of the Communist Terrorist Group (CTG) in Western Visayas, who has a pending warrant of arrest for robbery in band, with a bounty of P550,000 on his head. Young Vargas also served as a former platoon leader in the Sentro De Grabidad Platoon, Central Negros 2, Komiteng Rehiyon-Negros, Cebu Bohol, Siquijor (KR-NCBS), and Central Negros 3, and a member of the Regional Operations Command (ROC). His wife, Mylene, previously held the position of political instructor in SDG Platoon, CN 2. The couple was dispatched by the Regional Operations Command (ROC) from Central Negros to reinforce the recovery efforts of the dismantled NNF. Both individuals, along with Ericson Acosta, also a top NPA Cadre and husband of Kerima Lorena Tariman, former Secretary of NNF, have existing warrants of arrest for attempted murder issued by Acting Presiding Judge Walter Zorilla of the Regional Trial Court Branch 56 in Himamaylan City. Vargas also faces multiple outstanding warrants for murder, with no recommended bail issued by the court in Kabankalan City. He is known to be involved in numerous violent incidents, including targeted killings, ambushes of both Army and police officers and civilians, and extortion activities targeting big businesses. Vargas' brother, known as Hans, Platoon Leader of Platoon 3 and Deputy of South West Front-Komiteng Rehiyon-Negros, was also killed in an encounter with the troops of the PNP's 6th Special Action Force Battalion in Sitio Balik-balik, Barangay Tabu in Ilog town in September 2021. Hans is likewise wanted for multiple murder cases. Meanwhile, 3ID Commander, Major General Marion R Sison, emphasized that this incident involving the Vargas couple is a hard truth on how the CTG destroys the very foundation of our society ‚Äì the family. First, they lure the parents, and when they do, the kids soon become easy prey. This unfortunate turn of events should serve as a strong reminder to everyone that joining the CTG leads to nothing but harm, including the destruction of families and unnecessary loss of life. For more than five decades, the CTG has brought nothing but chaos to the communities and misery to our people. It is high time that we all bring an end to local armed conflict and start building peace for our kids and future generations. ‚ÄúWe sympathize with the Vargas family for their loss. While Jocelyn vehemently denied the involvement of her son with the CTG, it can be understood and it was a normal reaction from a mother. But the fact remains that the couple were active members of the CTG. Both have arrest warrants for their participation in CTG atrocities, and their true identities were confirmed by their former comrades. These pieces of evidence were also corroborated by revelations of our informants,‚Äù MGen Sison ended. #ùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó®ùóªùó∂ùòÅùó≤ùó±ùó•ùó≤ùóπùó∂ùóÆùóØùóπùó≤ #ùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó≤ùóøùóîùóøùó∫ùòÜùó¶ùòÅùóøùóºùóªùó¥ùó≤ùóøùóñùóºùòÇùóªùòÅùóøùòÜ #ùó¶ùó≤ùóøùòÉùó∂ùóªùó¥ùòÅùóµùó≤ùó£ùó≤ùóºùóΩùóπùó≤ùó¶ùó≤ùó∞ùòÇùóøùó∂ùóªùó¥ùòÅùóµùó≤ùóüùóÆùóªùó± #ùóîùóôùó£ùòÜùóºùòÇùó∞ùóÆùóªùóßùó•ùó®ùó¶ùóß #ùó¨ùóºùòÇùóøùó£ùóµùó∂ùóπùó∂ùóΩùóΩùó∂ùóªùó≤ùóîùóøùó∫ùòÜ #ùó£ùóÆùóøùóÆùó¶ùóÆùóïùóÆùòÜùóÆùóª #ùóüùóºùòÉùó≤ùó±ùóØùòÜùòÅùóµùó≤ùó£ùó≤ùóºùóΩùóπùó≤ #TerroristsWorstNightmare #ùóΩùóµùó∂ùóπùó∂ùóΩùóΩùó∂ùóªùó≤ùóÆùóøùó∫ùòÜùòÄùóΩùó≤ùóÆùóøùóµùó≤ùóÆùó±ùòÅùóøùóºùóºùóΩùó≤ùóøùòÄ ùë≠ùíêùíì ùíéùíêùíìùíÜ ùíñùíëùíÖùíÇùíïùíÜùíî, ùíëùíâùíêùíïùíêùíî ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùíóùíäùíÖùíÜùíêùíî ùíçùíäùíåùíÜ, ùíîùíâùíÇùíìùíÜ ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùë≠ùë∂ùë≥ùë≥ùë∂ùëæ ùíêùíñùíì ùíëùíÇùíàùíÜ!",,183,"{'like_count': 112, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 30861}","79th Infantry ""Masaligan"" Battalion, 3ID, PA",,2023-10-19 08:27:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/372838717_692191296275738_712804147217355863_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=TmROVUX1iQwAX_WtuJc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDTatU4j_mYOafr1dbFqSZ4upyAeCMmcoo3I2E37Sbmeg&oe=655A9DFD,https://www.facebook.com/100064546218581/posts/720537496774451,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393805843_718314897003797_1218665964258234038_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=opAyUta5k6QAX_6m_5_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBc-OzLdPGc4dpjtC6xk_zlc2XQUlrAW6WWa20FsljauQ&oe=65368050

facebook,"Resolution is not the most important thing when conflict rears its ugly head. It‚Äôs definitely important, and you should always work towards resolution. But if you focus too much on it, you‚Äôll typically compromise your method to achieve it. One of the greatest lessons I‚Äôve learned in conflict is being more OK with things not being OK. In other words, being patient with the timing of the resolution. I‚Äôm not saying to avoid conflict, and I‚Äôm also not saying to stop pursuing resolution. But I am saying that sometimes we need to surrender the timing of when the resolution happens. Conflict resolution takes two people. And you can‚Äôt control the other person. When you try to control the other person to reach a resolution, you‚Äôre on your way to creating another issue to resolve! When you focus on respecting your spouse over the resolution, the resolution typically happens faster and more naturally. It might not happen in your timing, but when you prioritize respect, chances are it will happen. . . . #respect #conflict #conflictresolution #marriagetips #marriagerevolution #turnlovearound",,177,"{'like_count': 105, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 36502}",Marriage Revolution,,2023-10-19 23:01:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312483289_542904561179974_2669711524998037364_n.jpg?stp=c155.155.770.770a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4BfV8eHKpDMAX-F3hLk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBDtBIM8PLdUied7s6KodDUnF6l1sjEPCtMVlaDFbnnEw&oe=655B6237,https://www.facebook.com/100063813043316/posts/806726128131148,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393783253_806726098131151_5833843402195305052_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=TEfavhv9aZYAX_KD7oB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCMFC-402yuQd7wGIkT42d-0iJyItORbjzDgL9aRoTe1g&oe=65594F83

facebook,"When someone tries to apologize by putting themselves down instead of taking responsibility for their actions and the harm they've caused, that's not a true apology. Self-pity apologies may deflect blame, but genuine apologies mean owning up to your mistakes, acknowledging the hurt caused, and actively working to make things right.

facebook,"Errand of Mercy In today‚Äôs world it would be nice to have an all powerful parental figure who could set us straight and keep us from killing each other. This episode was pivotal because up to that point The Federation and Klingons could have been locked in war for multiple seasons but because of the Organian Peace Treaty they mostly are relegated to small skirmishes. The adversarial relationship between Kor and Kirk is one of the best in the series perhaps only third to Khan and Kang. Also I really like Kirk‚Äôs attitude in this episode! He had a mission, he is focused, and he is formidable! ‚ÄúYou do not like to be pushed‚Ä¶very good.‚Äù The dialogue between Kirk and Kor once Kirk is found out is a great moment of two ‚Äútigers‚Ä¶two predators‚Äù circling around looking for the right time to attack! Finally, the episode is again one of hopefulness, that humans can eventually advance to the point where we are higher imagos of ourselves such that war and conflict is not necessary but only peace and togetherness.

facebook,"Whet Sheikh Gumi should understand is that if twins are separated at birth and adopted by a Christian and Muslim family, respectively, they will grow up and likely take their parent‚Äôs religion. That is why we must stop hating people based on their religion. People mostly don't choose their faith. It chose them. Most people are just a product of parental conditioning. That is why they say things like ‚ÄòI was born a Christian' or 'I was born a Muslim‚Äô. You were not born as an adherent of any religion. You entered this world with only one identity, which is the identity of a human being. It is on Earth you met religion. And you will leave it here. Because there is no religion in heaven except love! Sheikh Gumi's statement about not trusting Christians with Nigeria's security is regrettable and disturbing. We have come together as a country for 63 years, and this type of statement sets us back and builds distrust. We need competence and patriotism to tackle insecurity, not religious bias. Did Sheikh Gumi experience the kind of insecurity he saw in Kaduna under Nasir El-Rufai during the administration of Patrick Yakowa, a Christian? That, right there, disproves his theory. How can he think that Wike will make the FCT an extension of Israel and people with beards will be killed? That type of thinking is unfounded. Wike has no power over the Army, Navy, Air Force, or the Paramilitary Forces. Those are squarely under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, who is a Muslim, like Gumi. We have, to a large extent, successfully managed our diversity in Nigeria, and it will be most helpful if we do not allow the conflict in Palestine and Israel to cause us to hate each other. Nigeria is not Israel. Nigeria is a heterogeneous country that should serve as an example of peaceful religious coexistence to Israel if we get our acts right. #TableShaker",,172,"{'like_count': 105, 'comment_count': 41, 'num_users': 165530}",Build Up Nigeria,,2023-10-19 19:14:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/139683365_247116250113893_4747415548821481883_n.jpg?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=9dRAmYqKMnwAX8Dd3Su&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDQCCuozQDHGyey0D8aAhmY04C8qYmcyQS_dOj2GW9hJw&oe=657D14AB,https://www.facebook.com/100044465588234/posts/902906667868178,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393927400_902906627868182_6791562343999558648_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mDsiB5Bg43YAX8gz3Q2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCX_h6VsfjrKBgtYDM0G3E7Q42chLOL53MCHgbSWG6xrA&oe=65362E8D

Si Tatay Didit ay isa sa ating mga Friends Rescued na mapayapang sumuko pagkatapos mabatid ang mapanlinlang na hangarin ng CPP-NPA-NDF. Siya ay kasalukuyang tinutulungan at inaabutan ng tulong mula sa TF-ELCAC at partner agencies upang makapagsimula ulit ng maayos at progresibong buhay. Ngunit, ang pagkawalay nila kay Cherry Ann ay nagdadala ng pangamba at kalungkutan sa kanilang mag-asawa dahil sa walang kasiguraduhang kaligtasan ng kanilang anak. Bukod pa dito, hindi pa rin nakikita at nakakasama ni Cherry Ann ang kanyang sariling supling na iniwan niya dahil sa nasabing grupo. Nais ni Tatay Didit na makita at malaman ni Cherry Ann na may pag-asa pa at may tulong na maibibigay sa kanya kapag siya ay nagpasyang sumuko ng mapayapa at bumalik sa kanilang piling.

The Sabbath is much more so than any other day because it holds in its fold immense blessings and opportunities for reborn. So, this is our prayer this Sabbath: ‚ÄúO HaShem, Thou art our God, we will exalt Thee, we will praise Thy name, for Thou hast done wonderful things; even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.‚Äù (Isaiah 25:1). As we keep the Shabbat, we mustn‚Äôt fail to recount His enduring goodness, for keeping us safe, alive, and well in these very turbulent and virus beleaguered times. We also include the fervent prayer that God will, in His compassionate mercy, heal the world and bring an end to every pestilence, pandemic, conflict and war. Let us therefore keep from defiling the Shabbat and remember that more than we have kept the Shabbat, the SHABBAT has kept us as a people, together, and safe from annihilation. May HASHEM, the Eternal One, blessed is He, grant that we experience the limitless joy of the holy Shabbat and through it, bring peace to our borders and shower His blessings upon our leaders that they may lead the nation(s) in righteousness, with equity and justice.

facebook,"SIRIUS by Olaf Stapledon. Subtitled: ""A Fantasy of Love and Discord"". Penguin Books | 1st U.K pb, 3rd impression | 188 pp. | ¬£0.30 | 1973. Cover illustration by David Pelham. Originally published in hc format in the U.K. by Secker & Warburg, 1944. First pb edition in the U.K. by Penguin Books, 1964. ‚ÄîBack cover text‚Äî SIRIUS is a tale of immense and tragic pathos in which Olaf Stapledon evokes the terrible loneliness of a dog born with the mind of a man. Thomas Trelone's life-work was to explore the possibilities of producing a superman by experimenting with hormone injections into various mammals. Sirius himself is infinitely the most successful of these trials.

facebook,"On Tuesday, many media outlets rushed to amplify Hamas's claims about an Israeli airstrike on a Gaza hospital killing hundreds of Palestinians. Almost no part of the initial story turned out to be true. The blast was in the parking lot; it was caused by an errant Palestinian rocket, not an Israeli strike; and it's likely that the number of casualties was nowhere near what Hamas claimed. One of the most appalling journalistic failures around this story was Sky News's Anna Botting. In an interview with Netanyahu Senior Advisor Mark Regev, she made clear that she had abandoned even the pretense of objectivity or journalistic curiosity. After Regev denied that Israel targeted the hospital, she said, ""You have the capability to cause utter devastation to the people of Gaza City. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened tonight. The real fact of it is whatever is the cause of this, it might be too late, the touch paper has already been lit, do you understand that?"" In other words, the truth about the explosion was irrelevant to the question of who was to blame. This is appalling coming from someone whose job is supposed to be finding out the truth. Even after the full facts were known, Botting continued to blame Israel. In an interview with IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus, she asked, ""Do you accept though, that those people would not have been sheltering in the vicinity of a hospital like this if you hadn‚Äôt bombed them out of their homes?"" That's a frankly outrageous question. Hamas started this war with its barbaric slaughter of innocent civilians on October 7. Botting has shown her true colors and her complete lack of journalistic integrity. She cannot be trusted to report on this conflict.",,165,"{'like_count': 67, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 248884}",Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis - CAMERA,,2023-10-19 23:30:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/323554968_1328192964389878_3786086240506440141_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=UwG4NbzNuygAX9-GNHr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAFqHGGdKARMtb2c56QJh95cyIpSmNXfoS8YbAMJb-TNg&oe=6559F74D,https://www.facebook.com/100064847076093/posts/732114592293437,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/754814982819122996?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.camera.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F10%2FScreen-Shot-2023-10-19-at-11.46.43-AM.png&fb_obo=1&utld=camera.org&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbGVy9VXAoFpz0IJ-Ps1EbIHi0TrLpdjcpwvcu6QvDYcVQ&oe=6554796E

facebook,"üåç Hello Dear Friends, Cultural Creatives & Seekers Everywhere, War does not determine who is right, it determines who is left. The world is currently trying to come to terms with the inhumane atrocities carried out by both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Around the globe, citizens are rallying in a concerted effort to bring an end to the barbaric nature of planetary violence and war in today‚Äôs modern world. On the horizon, I see a second opportunity is now arising wherein global civilization is once again coalescing and demanding an end to war. War, violence, and division only perpetuate a cycle of suffering. We must now begin to emphasize that it is not our differences, but our common humanity that must come to the forefront. Through nurturing compassion and empathy, we will come to recognize the notion that the well-being of one is intrinsically linked to the well-being of all. This is the first step towards healing the world. In times of crisis, we come together to support one another, regardless of our backgrounds. This ability to unite must extend beyond moments of crisis to become a way of life. It is my fervent hope that we can create a world where differences are celebrated, where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and understanding, and where the power of our shared humanity prevails. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a painful reminder of the work that lies ahead, but it is not an insurmountable challenge. Let us commit to educating ourselves about the complexities of this issue, to supporting peace initiatives, and to spreading the message of unity. By doing so, we can honor our shared humanity and work toward a future where conflicts no longer define our world.

facebook,"Solomon Islands Government acknowledge assistance from Australia in airlifting Solomon Islanders from Israel amidst conflict. The Solomon Islands Government has acknowledged the help of Australia in providing the safe departure of Solomon Islands nationals from Israel following the ongoing conflict in the area. The first 65 Solomon Islands nationals arrived in Sydney, Australia last night after they were transported out of Tel Aviv on board a Royal Australia Airforce flight on Tuesday 17th October bound for Dubai. Another 14 nationals were airlifted out of Tel Aviv on the 18 October and will be arriving in Brisbane at 22:20 tonight. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade in consultation with Prime Minister Office had been working closely with the Government of Australia through the High Commission in Honiara to facilitate the safe return of the Solomon Islanders who were attending the Feast of Tabernacles program. The Solomon Islands is grateful for the assistance rendered by the Government of Australia in providing safe passage for our nationals trapped in Israel after most commercial flights were disrupted since the conflict between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas began over a week ago. The Solomon Islands Mission representative in Australia welcomed the Solomon Islands nationals last night in Sydney and thanked the Government of Australia and their officials for the assistance. Apart from their safe passage, Australia is also making arrangement for overnight hotel accommodation in Sydney before the group will travel to Brisbane today (Thursday 19th October) in anticipation of their flight to the Solomon Islands. The first group will arrive in Honiara on Friday 20th October, while the second group will be home on Saturday 21st October 2023. ENDS////WITH PHOTOS CAPTIONS: 1.

facebook,"Yes, desire, passions, the whole emotional world breaks loose. Sex, power, and every devil in our nature gets loose when we become acquainted with the unconscious. Then you will suddenly see a new picture of yourself. That is why people are afraid and say there is no unconscious, like children playing hide-and-seek. A child goes behind a door and says, ‚ÄúNobody is behind this door; don‚Äôt look here!‚Äù And so we have two marvelous psychological theories that nothing is behind this door, don‚Äôt look here, this is nothing important. Those are apotropaic theories. But you will see that there is something, you must admit that there are such powers. Then you make an abstraction, you make marvelous abstract signs of it, and talk of it with only a sort of shy hinting. You speak euphemistically. As sailors never dared to say, ‚ÄúThis damned hell of a sea, this black sea that is always so stormy and smashes our ships!‚Äù They said, ‚ÄúThe welcoming benevolent sea . . .‚Äù‚Äîin order not to arouse those alarming impressions, or to irritate those dark wind demons. Instead of saying the archbishop of Canterbury, you say His Grace. You don‚Äôt say the pope has issued a very foolish encyclica, you say the Vatican. Or instead of speaking of those hellish liars, you say Wilhelm strasse, or Downing Street, or the Quai d‚ÄôOrsay. That is the euphemistic abstract way of putting things. Our science has the same purpose in using Latin or Greek words. It is a marvelous shield against the demons‚Äîthe demons are afraid of Greek because they do not understand it. And therefore we talk, as you have just demonstrated, in such an abstract way. So it is just that‚Äîyou get into the world of fire, where things become red-hot. After baptism you get right into hell‚Äîthat is the enantiodromia. And now comes the paradox of the East: it is also the fullness of jewels. But what is passion, what are emotions? There is the source of fire, there is the fullness of energy. A man who is not on fire is nothing: he is ridiculous, he is two-dimensional. He must be on fire even if he does make a fool of himself.

instagram,"Sick to my stomach.
This has been a heartbreaking week for so many of us. Im scared, disturbed, deeply saddened. We can always be doing more.

Ive been silent regarding the conflict about the war between Israel and Palestine because as some of you may know I recently just kept in touch with my father and my family who is now living in Palestine, Gaza. 
I‚Äôve been keeping my thoughts to myself because I felt like ‚ÄúOH I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
TO FORM AN OPINION"" or ‚ÄúIM NOT THAT CULTURALLY INFORMED‚Äù.
 But it doesn‚Äôt have to end there. 
Get educated.

I would like to express my deep sorrow for the Israelis who have lost their lives and been injured in the dreadful terrorist attacks. 
Hamas killing civilians was HORRIBLE but
Israel countering by killing 10√ó more civilians is beyond insane.
 I cannot remain silent in the face of the Israeli government's attempt to seek revenge from innocent civilians for the terrorist attack. I  will not remain silent about this genocide either specially that my family‚Äôs life depends on it.

In Israel's attacks, one Palestinian loses their life every 5 minutes.
Every hour, 3 children lose their lives. Can a baby be a terrorist?

How can so many be so silent? What are you scared of? Scared to defend basic human rights as innocent people are murdered. 

It‚Äôs been a long dark tunnel since oct 7  and a long way to go to immerge from this horendous situation.

Sharing with you my conversations with my brother @hassan_2000_zxk  and stepmother @e_no0osaaa 
is by far my biggest heartbreak. üíî

instagram,"Inzwischen soll es im Gazastreifen etwa 3000 Todesopfer geben. Das ist eine Zahl, die von der Hamas ausgegeben wird und sich nicht unabh√§ngig √ºberpr√ºfen l√§sst.

Gestern ging au√üerdem die Meldung durch viele Kan√§le in den Nachrichten und auf Insta, dass Israel ein Krankenhaus in Gaza angegriffen h√§tte. Etwa 500 Menschen seien dabei laut Hamas-Angaben gestorben. Inzwischen ist ziemlich sicher, dass diese Meldung nicht stimmt. Israel spricht von einer defekten Hamas-Rakete, die auf dem Parkplatz des Krankenhauses eingeschlagen sein soll. Bild- und Videomaterial, das inzwischen vom Einschlagsort vorliegt, spricht laut Tagesschau-Analyse f√ºr diese israelische Version. Auch die Hamas-Angaben zum Zustand des Krankenhauses nach der Explosion und der Opferzahl sind demnach zweifelhaft. Dieser Vorfall ist extrem emotional und wird f√ºr Propaganda genutzt. Es ist deshalb wichtig, dass gesicherte Fakten vorliegen, bevor solche (vermeintlichen) Angriffe endg√ºltig bewertet werden k√∂nnen.

instagram,"Starbucks and the union representing its U.S. workers filed lawsuits against each other on October 18, in a disagreement over a pro-Palestine post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

The tweet in question went up on the Starbucks Workers United (SWU) account on October 9, 2 days after the Israel-Gaza conflict began. It read, 'Solidarity with Palestine' and quote-tweeted an image of a bulldozer operated by Hamas tearing down a fence along the Gaza Strip. The post was deleted after 40 minutes.

In Starbucks‚Äô lawsuit, filed in federal court in Iowa, the coffee chain said that the pro-Palestinian post angered customers and tarnished the company‚Äôs reputation. It's suing for trademark infringement and seeking to have the union stop using its name, 'Starbucks Workers Union,' and its logo, which includes a green circle and resembles Starbucks' logo.

Starbucks has argued the name confuses customers, who take their anger about SWU‚Äôs stance out on store employees. The company said it received more than 1,000 complaints about the tweet and people spray-painted Stars of David and a swastika on the windows of a Rhode Island store.

There have also been calls for boycotts from politicians, including Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL). 'This is disgusting,' Scott tweeted on October 11 in reference to the union‚Äôs post. 'Every American should condemn the atrocities that Iran-backed Hamas terrorists committed in Israel. Boycott Starbucks until its leadership strongly denounces and takes action against this horrific support of terrorism.'

Starbucks' official statement, released on October 11, expressed sympathy for innocent people on both sides of the conflict. 'Starbucks unequivocally condemns acts of hate, terrorism and violence.'

SWU, which represents more than 9,000 workers at more than 360 stores, responded to the company‚Äôs lawsuit with its own filing in federal court. The union argued their X profile identifies it as a union. IT also noted that unions often use the company name of the workers they represent.

instagram,"In a conflict of biblically historical proportions in the Middle East that have re-erupted in a slaughter of innocent human life, the humanity in me sees there are no sides here. 
There are only people. 
I cannot for the life of me think of how more bloodshed will make any of this better. 

My hope is for the Israeli State to end their brutal siege in Gaza, end their illegal occupation and return to the Palestinian people their basic human rights. 
 My hope is for the safe return of Hamas held hostages to their families.

And although it shouldn‚Äôt need to be reiterated, I fear it does: to support the Palestinian call for freedom does NOT mean support for Hamas, who I unequivocally condemn. 
To have disdain for the Israeli State‚Äôs horrific approach to Gaza is NOT a comment on Jewish People or the Jewish Faith, who I unequivocally respect. 
To blur these clear moral distinctions to suit a one sided narrative will not come to any good. 
The human lives involved here deserve better leadership.

I realize it‚Äôs difficult for so many to see straight when dealing with so much pain.
Even so, we cannot change the actions that have come before. We can only choose the reactions that have yet to come.

San Francisco thank you for such a beautiful evening last night! Deeply grateful for your presence. This place feels like home because of you!

Embracing the ups and downs of relationships is one of the best ways to build harmony. Our attachment to fun, excitement, and perfection can lead us into the unreasonable idea that a relationship should be continuously pleasant. 

The reality is that human beings cannot constantly sustain such high energy levels, if we tried to, we would either fall into performative and untruthful behavior or we would burn out and crash. Like the seasons, we also go through phases, and this directly impacts how we show up. 

Especially when a relationship is open to growth, there may be times when one of you is moving through and unloading old hurt/trauma or in need of a slowing down period for proper integration of new wisdom. When two people can appreciate that moods vary and calmly communicate the reality of the moment they are in, it becomes easier to step up for each other and provide loving support. 

When two people are in close proximity there will eventually be some form of conflict that arises; how you handle conflicts over time can determine whether your connection becomes deeper or whether you start drifting apart.

Ego craves to win, but loving clarity seeks to understand. When you bring awareness to your ego, it loses its power and gives more space for your actions to become motivated by a loving clarity. In these difficult moments, you want to be fair and take turns describing your perspectives. 

It is especially helpful if you focus your narratives around how you felt as things transpired as opposed to just placing blame. You shouldn‚Äôt try to invalidate each other‚Äôs perspectives. Once it is clear how you both felt, the real work revolves around collectively figuring out how you can meet each other in the middle and move forward.

instagram,"A State Department official involved with transferring arms to key American allies resigned from his post on Wednesday, saying that ‚Äúshortsighted decisions‚Äù by the Biden administration contributed to his having to make an unbearable moral compromise.

‚ÄúIn my 11 years I have made more moral compromises than I care to recall, each heavily, but each with my promise to myself in mind, and intact,‚Äù the official, Josh Paul, wrote in a post explaining his decision. ‚ÄúI am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued ‚Äì indeed, expanded and expedited ‚Äì provision of lethal arms to Israel ‚Äì I have reached the end of that bargain.‚Äù

‚ÄúI cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse,‚Äù he added.

His decision comes as the Biden administration has been surging weapons and munitions to Israel, a longtime key ally in the Middle East, following the Palestinian militant group Hamas‚Äô surprise attack against the country earlier this month.

In a statement to us, Paul, who worked for State‚Äôs Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, outlined several actions that he believes the Biden administration and Congress could take to better address the ongoing crisis, including recognition of a Palestinian state as a part of the diplomatic process, rather than an eventual goal, and better recognition of human rights in arms transfers.

instagram,"Obeying Jesus‚Äô command taught me several powerful truths we experience when we pray for people who have hurt us:

1. Prayer shields our hearts from bitterness. It gives us a verbal outlet for our pain, a way to begin releasing our resentment to God. It prevents righteous anger and real hurt from twisting into damaging bitterness.

2. Prayer humbles us. It reminds us that even when we have been hurt, we are imperfect and need grace too. It may even help us to consider the conflict from the other person‚Äôs perspective.

3. Prayer helps us resist the temptation to seek revenge. It reminds us that God loves justice and that we can trust Him to defend and protect us.

4. Prayer gives us peace while we wait for resolution. Praying strengthens our relationship with God during our relational conflict. We trust that God is working even when we can‚Äôt see or understand all He is doing.

If you‚Äôre embroiled in a conflict, wrestling with bitterness, or feeling hurt or confused by a strained relationship, Jesus‚Äô encouragement to pray for your enemy may provide the protection your heart needs. You can pray about your situation, and pray for the person with whom you are in conflict, every day ‚Äî even multiple times a day.

Feeling wounded by a friend‚Äôs refusal to accept your apology? You can pray about that.

Feeling afraid she may hurt more people if she doesn‚Äôt change? You can pray about that.

Longing to attempt reconciliation but not sure the other person will even speak to you? You can pray about that.

We can pray about all of it. God welcomes our requests, and He longs to help His children find forgiveness and unity (John 17:20-23).

It takes time, but when we commit to persistently praying for those who offend us, we give God the chance to work on their hearts ‚Äî and ours.

Josh Paul, a US State Department official, has resigned over President Joe Biden's handling of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.

The senior official, who has worked for over a decade on arms transfers in the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, announced his retirement on October 18 in a two-page letter.

Explaining his reasons for resigning, he wrote: ‚ÄúI believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and Palestinian people - and is not in the long-term American interest"".

Paul also expressed his desire to protect innocent people ‚Äì both Israeli and Palestinian.

‚ÄúCollective punishment is an enemy to that desire, whether it involves demolishing one home or one thousand; as too is ethnic cleansing; as too is occupation; as too is apartheid,"" he said.

instagram,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a season that could convince you love is not blind, but dead,‚Äù writes TIME critic Judy Berman. 

The fifth season of Netflix‚Äôs #LoveIsBlind turned out to be a season that couldn‚Äôt even put a happy face on its so-called social experiment by marrying off one reasonably sympathetic couple.

After a relatively low-conflict fourth season that resulted in three marriages out of four couples, fans have been savoring the drama of the show‚Äôs latest episodes, featuring singles from Houston.

Yet, when you remember that there are real people behind the breathless headlines, the show‚Äôs soapy mess keeps getting harder to enjoy. And as the deceptions, delusions, and alleged abuses of this past season of ‚ÄòLove Is Blind‚Äô have underscored, nothing good can come of so much reality-TV artifice masquerading as true romance.

‚ÄúIt seems fair to conclude that the highly stage-managed environment of reality dating just isn‚Äôt healthy,‚Äù Berman writes, for the contestants, or the viewers.

At the link in bio, read more on why the most recent season calls for a reality dating show reckoning.

instagram,"""I couldn‚Äôt shift anything, I resigned""

A senior official at the US State Department issued his resignation on Wednesday evening, citing the Biden administration‚Äôs approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

‚ÄúLet me be clear: Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities,‚Äù Josh Paul said in a letter, which was posted on X by Brian Finucane, a senior adviser at Crisis Group.

‚ÄúBut I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response, and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people - and is not in the long term American interest.‚Äù

Paul worked for more than 10 years in the State Department‚Äôs Political-Military Affairs bureau, which is in charge of approving arms transfers to other countries.

In an interview with Huffington Post, Paul said that he resigned because he ""couldn‚Äôt shift anything"".

Biden has been clear in stating that he will support Israel unequivocally as it takes action against Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, which on 7 October launched a surprise attack on Israel.

The war has so far killed more than 3,000 Palestinians, including around 1,000 children and 1,000 women, while also killing more than 1,400 Israelis.

MEE reported last week that the White House‚Äôs phrasing of any calls for a ceasefire were ‚Äúrepugnant‚Äù, sending a chilling message to progressive lawmakers and anti-war activists.

The Biden administration is currently drafting a major foreign aid bill that would include $10bn for Israel. In addition to the aid package, the US has also deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern Mediterranean and has readied 2,000 American troops to be deployed in order to support Israel, as the country readies for a ground invasion of Gaza.

‚ÄúI cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse,‚Äù Paul said further in his letter.",,11239,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 1239, 'num_users': 1157344}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-19 02:15:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15258686_1293569957329919_8094586152507408384_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CJDb2hU5us0AX_v4NHq&_nc_oc=AQmhTNx9JSMKJ7ByPW-gAGlyTUGiK1GB9OxZLYVv7ZLpS0ddjuukWkjI1QowiM0WwAw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDM7VWUIVa31bFMO0RjUyWcPwhVRpDGdNt6sYzg3bsFBw&oe=655A8754,https://www.instagram.com/p/CykDIoFsbal/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391611811_731922702304504_4953953771273158353_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=TTFyyakpCE8AX98wrTA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCQg1xMmdwdbFeCsI9Py3N5P7Cf1Mbhh0vAaiaZJ9oKTQ&oe=65393339

Yousof is from Michigan, but is in Gaza RIGHT NOW. 

Below üëáüèº is a statement from his family

Yousof Abushaban, a US citizen, is in Gaza alongside his two sisters, his mother, and his blind father, Abedalazeez. 

They are trapped.

Yousof, holding on to his American passport, dared to hope that he could lead his family to safety. After contacting the American embassy, he embarked on a perilous journey to the Egyptian border, desperate to escape the horrors surrounding him. 

But, heartbreakingly, the border remained sealed. 

A few days later, their lives took a drastic turn when Israel's bombs struck their home.

There was no warning, no chance to escape, just the deafening explosion that killed Yousof's 15-year old sister, Joud. 

Joud is gone. 

Yousof, his father, his mother, and his other 8-year-old sister, all wounded and injured, barely survived.

Abedalazeez, the father, already living in darkness due to his blindness, now faces the threat of an amputation. 

They are all American üá∫üá∏ ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt seem to matter now. 

The hospitals in Gaza have become sanctuaries for those who have lost their homes and loved ones in this conflict. They are crowded, stretched to their limits, and even worse, they have been bombed. 

Now, Yousof sleeps on a cold and dirty hospital floor. Which could be bombed next. 

The world cannot ignore the plight of this family trapped in Gaza.

instagram,"Israel's Iron Dome air defense system has been lauded for reaching a 90% interception rate in past attacks. It would face a much bigger test in the event of a wider conflict in the region.

The US-backed system of interconnected radar and mobile missile batteries is designed to shoot down rockets, missiles and mortars that could hit Israeli population centers or important infrastructure. But like any air defense system, it relies on sufficient stocks of interceptor missiles and can be overrun if the incoming assault is large enough.

American officials are worried about the possibility of Lebanon‚Äôs Iran-backed Hezbollah firing precision missiles at Israeli cities, while the country‚Äôs military gets engaged in grinding urban warfare in densely populated Gaza. With around 100,000 missiles and rockets estimated to be at Hezbollah‚Äôs disposal, such an overwhelming offensive and a decline in Iron Dome‚Äôs effectiveness are seen as plausible among officials in the Middle East and beyond.

‚ÄúThis action was a demonstration of the integrated air and missile defense architecture that we have built in the Middle East, and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interests in this important region,‚Äù Ryder said at a press conference Thursday.

‚ÄúInformation about these engagements is still being processed. We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea, potentially toward targets in Israel,‚Äù he said.

instagram,"Let me start by saying‚Ä¶

The tone and attitude in which you say these 12 phrases make a huge difference.

The goal of these 12 different phrases is to shift the energy in the conflict from being positioned to being neutral, and from there, you can much more easily get to curiosity.

Getting positioned in what we think we know in a conflict is easy. We see ourselves as correct and our spouses as wrong. This can create WWIII.

If you don‚Äôt want WWIII, it is important to be neutral, which means you get off of being right or stuck in what you think you know. When you are neutral, you can see your and your partner‚Äôs sides. 

You can ask questions and learn and grow.

To get there, you will need to defuse the hostile energy.

These 12 phases can help you do that.

A sizeable number attended the prayers with their children in response to the organizers‚Äô appeal to the community to express solidarity and make dua for the safety of the people who are in distress.

Apart from Qunoot-e-Nazila prayers, several silent protests or flash protests are being regularly organised in Hyderabad in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah conflict that started this month.

A flash protest was also held recently at Shahalibanda. Another small silent protest was held near Charminar with youth holding placards standing silently to express their solidarity.

What are Qunoot e Nazila prayers?
Qunoot-e-Nazila is a special prayer by Muslims performed during calamities that befall the community. It is preferable to perform it during Fajr prayers (namaz before dawn) but can be performed during any five obligatory prayers.

instagram,"Amr Diab's Empathy Shines, A Five-Million-Pound Contribution for Gaza Relief

In times of hardship and crisis, it is often the actions of individuals that shine a light on the path of compassion and unity. Renowned Egyptian artist, Amr Diab, has set a remarkable example by donating five million Egyptian pounds to the Egyptian Red Crescent Society to support the besieged Palestinian people in Gaza.

instagram,"While loathe to add one more uninformed voice to the cacophony, I am compelled to contribute my own sorrow for lost Israeli and Palestinian lives, lost freedom, lost hope, lost intact families, lost basic human rights, lost necessities to even survive. 

I can‚Äôt imagine what it has been like to live in an occupied land for almost 4 generations. 

I can‚Äôt imagine what it is like to have your children kidnapped. 

I can‚Äôt imagine having my street bombed. 

I can‚Äôt imagine having my water and food supply cut off with my babies in the house. 

I can‚Äôt imagine losing my neighbors to a terrorist attack. 

I can‚Äôt imagine living inside a conflict that is centuries old. 

I can‚Äôt imagine 1000 dead children in a day. 

I can‚Äôt imagine getting my wounded loved one to a hospital only to have it bombed. 

I can‚Äôt help but think like a mother. Ordinary citizens are not the government. Regular neighbors are not the terrorist organization. Almost all of us are just daughters and sons and moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles, innocents, all. We want the same things: basic freedom, safety, and the possibility of goodness for our families. When I think about Palestinian and Israeli mothers going to bed tonight having lost their children, terrified of more violence, just normal people in normal towns, I weep. 

We aren‚Äôt the lawmakers, the legislators, the ambassadors, or the power brokers. Nor are we the terrorists, kidnappers, murderers, or abusers. Also notably, we aren‚Äôt the pundits, analysts, experts, or strategists. We are just the ordinary, global neighbors of the ordinary people of Palestine and Israel, and our tool is compassion. I wish with all my heart for stabilization, liberation, safety, and the end of war for our neighbors. I wish for free people living on free land. I wish all moms could put their babies to bed tonight without fear. 

In this grant round, @legacycollective has nominated Global Empowerment Mission supporting all refugees fleeing the region through Egypt. If we lose the capacity to care for families running for their lives, there is no hope for any of us. If you‚Äôd like to join us, I will put the link in stories.

instagram,"Where were you and the energy when Hamas att@cked and k!lled innocent Israelis? - Super Eagles star, John Ogu slams Mohamed Salah following his plea for humanitarian aid to Gaza

Super Eagles midfielder, John Ogu, who plays in Israel has slammed Egyptian footballer Mohamed Salah over his call for humanitarian aid to reach Gaza 'immediately' as the Israel-Palestine conflict continues.

On Tuesday, October 17, a massive explosion k!lled hundreds of people at a crowded hospital in Gaza City, which the Liverpool forward described as 'h0rrifying.'

Palestinian officials say the  explosion was caused by an¬†Israeli¬†Defence Forces (IDF) air strike, while officials in the Jewish state insisted it was the result of a 'failed' rocket launched by terrorist group Islamic Jihad.

Salah in his message said: 'It's not always easy to speak at a time like this. There has been too much violence and brutality, the escalation in recent weeks has been unbearable to witness.'¬†¬†

''All lives are sacred and must be protected. The massacres need to stop, families are being torn apart.¬†

''What's clear now is that humanitarian aid to Gaza must be allowed immediately. The people there are in terrible conditions. The scenes at the hospital last night were horrifying.¬†

''The people of Gaza need food, water, and medical supplies urgently. I am calling on world leaders to come together and prevent the slaughter of innocent souls. Humanity must prevail.' Salah added

Reacting to Salah's message to the world, Ogu slammed him for staying mute after Hamas att@cked, k!lled, and kidnapped innocent Israelis at a festival earlier this month, which triggered the war.",,8626,"{'like_count': 7105, 'comment_count': 1521, 'num_users': 2348308}",Lindaikejiblog,,2023-10-19 11:09:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/203350425_509791997028301_6352041437644260111_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=awR2DqVxWCQAX_ZXF7v&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBaEjsEoe5UmOwZYuy6CByXzFHs6AYuiQ9dAMX2K9QtPg&oe=655B8B36,https://www.instagram.com/p/CylASJFObQL/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393181852_1407184403198527_2681906378538746377_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=hQPoyZsTtjIAX972iPO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAatJJ42VdbE-CTwrK1SXZ2V1qsaSKeZEbraqJUQ-KcrA&oe=65357479

instagram,"Pakistan Thursday dispatched the first consignment carrying relief assistance to Gaza as Israel's indiscriminate bombardment continues on the Hamas-ruled strip, killing thousands and displacing millions.

The relief assistance, carrying one thousand winter tents, four thousand blankets, and three tonnes of medicines, will reach Palestine via Egypt in a chartered aircraft, the Foreign Office said in a statement.

Israel's unabated airstrikes on Gaza have claimed nearly 3,500 lives while thousands of others are injured. Entire city blocks have been levelled, water, food, and power have been cut off, and over one million people have been displaced.

Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel has claimed more than 1,400 lives ‚Äî and the conflict has set off a wave of fury across the Middle East against Israel and its Western allies.
On the Gaza side, scores of people were again waiting, desperate to flee, but careful to keep a distance of about 100 metres (300 feet) in case of new Israeli strikes.

There are fears of worse to come if Israel launches its anticipated ground invasion aimed at destroying Hamas and rescuing Israeli and foreign hostages, whose known number Israel on Thursday revised up to 203.

instagram,"‚ö°Ô∏èCotton University Elections: RKB wins big in the Cotton University Students‚Äô Union Elections - bagging the top four posts of the Union.

Javed Akhtar Qadri won the post of General Secretary, Himangshu Kumar Das won the post of President, Akshayata Das won the post of Vice President and Gargi Sharma won the post of Asstt. General Secretary.

With a polling of 2450 votes, Javed won bagging 1000 votes.

The interesting equation here is that AASU did not back RKB as they do traditionally. According to sources, an internal split-up between the seniors of RKB and an internal conflict with AASU led to the hostel contesting this election as ‚Äòindependent‚Äô.

However, questions on independence arise with rumours around AIUDF funding Javed-led RKB this time. There are rumours on whether NSUI agreed to fund RKB. However, these are not yet certain.

instagram,"We call on our government to act now to bring the hostages home. Alive, healthy, and whole. It‚Äôs possible. Our government cannot give up on the hostages. Our government cannot run from their responsibility to these people. 200 hostages in Gaza. It‚Äôs possible, it‚Äôs necessary, it‚Äôs a must that we make every effort to free them.

Around 200 men, women, and children were kidnapped into the Gaza Strip at the hands of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Every one of these hostages is a whole world, a world unto themselves. And they are all part of families and communities - parents, siblings, partners, children, friends. 200 worlds. It‚Äôs forbidden for us to give up on them.

We can save Avinatan, Andrey, Segev, Almog, Ofek, Eitan, Tamar, Eden, Avigail, Rom, Vivian, Moran - we can save them and so many others. We can bring back peace of heart to so many parents, siblings, families, and friends. We can release them and we must release them. They‚Äôre trusting us.

At the moment, we know almost nothing about their status, mainly because Hamas is preventing anyone from seeing them - including the Red Cross. Parents are panicking for their children who may not have their inhalers, children worried for their parents who don‚Äôt have their medicines, people on tenterhooks waiting for news on their loved one‚Äôs lives. They know that the mass-scale bombings in Gaza affect the hostages, too.

We are calling on the government of Israel, on US President Joe Biden, on the countries of the world and our Palestinian counterparts - to anyone who wants to advance a political solution and work to end the occupation and the conflict - to take action to secure the peace, safety, and return of the hostages.

Resistance to occupation doesn‚Äôt justify harming innocent civilians, just as Israel cannot justify harming civilians in Gaza. It‚Äôs our responsibility to oppose acts that hurt Israeli civilians, just as we oppose acts that hurt Palestinian civilians. Sooner or later, some sort of deal will come.

instagram,"Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @middleeasteye ""I couldn‚Äôt shift anything, I resigned""

A senior official at the US State Department issued his resignation on Wednesday evening, citing the Biden administration‚Äôs approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

‚ÄúLet me be clear: Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities,‚Äù Josh Paul said in a letter, which was posted on X by Brian Finucane, a senior adviser at Crisis Group.

‚ÄúBut I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response, and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people - and is not in the long term American interest.‚Äù

Paul worked for more than 10 years in the State Department‚Äôs Political-Military Affairs bureau, which is in charge of approving arms transfers to other countries.

In an interview with Huffington Post, Paul said that he resigned because he ""couldn‚Äôt shift anything"".

Biden has been clear in stating that he will support Israel unequivocally as it takes action against Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, which on 7 October launched a surprise attack on Israel.

The war has so far killed more than 3,000 Palestinians, including around 1,000 children and 1,000 women, while also killing more than 1,400 Israelis.

MEE reported last week that the White House‚Äôs phrasing of any calls for a ceasefire were ‚Äúrepugnant‚Äù, sending a chilling message to progressive lawmakers and anti-war activists.

The Biden administration is currently drafting a major foreign aid bill that would include $10bn for Israel. In addition to the aid package, the US has also deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern Mediterranean and has readied 2,000 American troops to be deployed in order to support Israel, as the country readies for a ground invasion of Gaza.

‚ÄúI cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse,‚Äù Paul said further in his letter.",,7594,"{'like_count': 7453, 'comment_count': 141, 'num_users': 612083}",Free Palestine,,2023-10-19 04:36:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/326811354_575337164702009_6553386013882455175_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=35AVk9LvJzQAX90JBzJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAo_cL95AfoqVH1G88Tf51htB_BLUWprZPNWqjjH1j5qw&oe=655B06E5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CykTRWWIOtM/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392935422_6758374440917679_3847124377483910503_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=LFn6od4P7nwAX917dHG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDzebC1oJKYGPc4ys9fHCiIw9DOxti4HWI_4fFy5BW17w&oe=6536C678
instagram,"üåç Hello Dear Friends, Cultural Creatives & Seekers Everywhere, 

War does not determine who is right, it determines who is left.

The world is currently trying to come to terms with the inhumane atrocities carried out by both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Around the globe, citizens are rallying in a concerted effort to bring an end to the barbaric nature of planetary violence and war in today‚Äôs modern world. On the horizon, I see a second opportunity is now arising wherein global civilization is once again coalescing and demanding an end to war.

War, violence, and division only perpetuate a cycle of suffering. We must now begin to emphasize that it is not our differences, but our common humanity that must come to the forefront. Through nurturing compassion and empathy, we will come to recognize the notion that the well-being of one  is intrinsically linked to the well-being of all. This is the first step towards healing the world.

In times of crisis, we come together to support one another, regardless of our backgrounds. This ability to unite must extend beyond moments of crisis to become a way of life. It is my fervent hope that we can create a world where differences are celebrated, where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and understanding, and where the power of our shared humanity prevails. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a painful reminder of the work that lies ahead, but it is not an insurmountable challenge.

Let us commit to educating ourselves about the complexities of this issue, to supporting peace initiatives, and to spreading the message of unity. By doing so, we can honor our shared humanity and work toward a future where conflicts no longer define our world.
 
With Peace, Love & Light, 
Bruce

instagram,"Years ago I worked in a Romanian orphanage in my Gap Year. It was a well intentioned but ultimately selfish act. The time came when I had to leave, which meant abandoning the (already traumatised) kids all over again. 
@hopeandhomesforchildren educated me about the profound damage #orphanages have on children; and that of the 5.4 million children confined to institutions around the World, 80% of them aren‚Äôt in fact orphans at all. They have a living relative, who, with the right support, can look after them.

I will always regret not returning to find Mirela (pictured) sooner. When I did find her ten years later, she was tied to a radiator, and had lost the ability to speak and walk - such was the neglect, and lack of love.

I will always be grateful to our #f1 #family (esp @pirelli_motorsport) for helping me build a home for her and her siblings.

No kid should grow up in an institution, help us reunite those separated from their families due to conflict, poverty, trafficking and lack of resource, by following @hopeandhomesforchildren 

And please don‚Äôt make the mistake that I did, by visiting orphanages and propping up often corrupt and exploitative institutions - which treat children like commodities. Can you ever imagine unvetted, paying strangers, being allowed to freely visit kids in schools in the UK? Don‚Äôt let it be the case abroad either.

instagram,"Franciscan University of Steubenville has announced the creation of an expedited transfer process for Jewish students in danger of antisemitic discrimination and violence on campuses across the United States. ‚Å£
‚Å£
The announcement comes amid violence in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúWith our fellow Christians around the world, we are praying for justice and peace,‚Äù said Father Dave Pivonka, TOR, president of Franciscan University. ‚ÄúBut with too many universities preaching tolerance but practicing prejudice, we feel compelled to do more.‚Äù ‚Å£
‚Å£
Despite record-breaking enrollment this school year, the Catholic university said it is willing to make the proper accommodations for any additional students. ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúOur community will welcome them with generosity and respect,‚Äù Pivonka said. ‚ÄúOur religious differences will not cause any conflict. On the contrary, at Franciscan, our radical fidelity to Christ and the Catholic faith demands of us fraternal charity toward our Jewish brothers and sisters, as it does toward all people.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
Dr. Stephen Hildebrand, vice president for academic affairs and a theology professor at Franciscan, spoke with CNA about the work the university is doing to welcome these potential new students.‚Å£
‚Å£
He explained that work is being done to rally support from the local community so that the needs of these students can be met, such as having a place of worship and the ability to receive a kosher diet. ‚Å£
‚Å£
While students are more than welcome to take classes in-person on campus, Franciscan will be offering online classes that can be started in the middle of the semester.‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúMy guess is that some of them, especially if they‚Äôre suffering persecution, might want to have the safety of home but have the opportunity to continue their education, so we have the ability to run online courses that we could start in the middle of the semester,‚Äù Hildebrand said.‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúWe see this as a small way, a small thing we can do, to really love our Jewish brethren and to have solidarity with them, to let them know that we recognize what is happening to them and that not only do we oppose it, but we‚Äôre willing to help them.‚Äù‚Å£

Global oil benchmark Brent hit $93 a barrel on Wednesday as the risk of escalating conflict in West Asia threatened to disrupt supplies from the region, with Iran calling for an oil embargo to be imposed on Israel. Gold jumped to the highest level since August even as stocks globally came under pressure. Since the Hamas attack on Oct 7, oil has risen 7.2% while gold is inching toward a nearly 7% rise amid uncertainties. Geopolitical tensions aside, other drivers are also supporting oil prices

Beginning their journey on October 5, 2001, ODA 595 made their way to Uzbekistan and, on October 19, crossed into Afghanistan via an MH-47 Chinook helicopter. Here, they established contact with Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Uzbek militia.

Adapting swiftly to their new environment, the team even learned to ride horses, a crucial skill. On November 10, ODA 595 and their militia allies achieved a monumental victory by liberating Mazar-e-Sharif from the Taliban.

instagram,"The Gaza Health Ministry reported Wednesday that 3,478 Palestinians have died and 12,065 injured since October 7.

Ashraf Al-Qedra, a ministry spokesperson, said 70% of the dead and injured are children, women, and the elderly. The Ministry reported the figures after an airstrike killed 471 at al-Ahli Arab Hospital. Israel and the U.S. have said the strike came from a missile misfire from Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The group has denied the allegations and blamed Israel. Israel has also disputed the death toll from the hospital blast. 

On October 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack, killing over 1,400 people in Israel, including at least 10 Nepali students.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an ‚Äúimmediate humanitarian ceasefire‚Äù to end the ‚Äúepic human suffering.‚Äù Israel had also cut off food, water, and electricity in Gaza. The U.S. has just brokered a deal to allow ‚Äú20 truckloads‚Äù of aid into Gaza via Egypt, the NY Times reported.

Meanwhile, several #SouthAsian countries weighed in after the news of the hospital blast:

‚Ä¢ India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: ‚ÄúDeeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured. Civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern. Those involved should be held responsible.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Pakistan caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar said: ‚ÄúIsrael must be held accountable for its war crimes as it continues its unrelenting bombardment and siege of Gaza that has resulted in death, destruction, and displacement.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Bangladesh‚Äôs Foreign Ministry said: ‚ÄúThis ruthless attack is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian laws and accords‚Äù and said perpetrators needed to be held responsible. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said: ‚ÄúWe saw the killing of people and children by bombing on a hospital in Gaza and blood-stained faces of the children yesterday.

instagram,"(Article via Washington post) The State Department on Thursday issued a rare ‚Äúworldwide caution‚Äù advisory to all Americans overseas, urging them to ‚Äúexercise increased caution due to the potential for violence and increased tensions‚Äù globally.

It said that there is a potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests. ‚ÄúStay alert in locations frequented by tourists,‚Äù it advised.

The State Department has urged U.S. travelers to ‚Äúreconsider travel‚Äù to Israel and the West Bank and placed a ‚Äúdo not travel‚Äù advisory ‚Äî its most severe warning ‚Äî on the Gaza Strip due to ‚Äúterrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict.‚Äù

Americans have been fleeing the country on charter flight and cruise ships since the Hamas attacks earlier this month. Over 7,000 U.S. citizens have departed Israel and the West Bank, a State Department spokeswoman told The Washington Post on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, the State Department raised its travel warning for Lebanon to ‚Äúdo not travel‚Äù because of rocket, missile and artillery exchanges between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah.

Karen Schwartz and Heidi P√©rez-Moreno contributed to this report.

instagram,"Leo by Lokesh Kanagaraj. An adequately satisfying spin around the broad strokes of ‚ÄòBaasha‚Äô and the original graphic novel, ‚ÄòA History of Violence‚Äô, with a terrific first hour and a refreshingly sauve Vijay high on emotions.

The first half - which I think is Lokesh‚Äôs best - impresses with the Opening sequence, Parthiban‚Äôs character, the conflict, and the interval banger everything was perfect. Perfect to the last-minute details. üíØ

Even though Loki delivered what he promised, he could‚Äôve worked better on the screenplay. Apart from the fight sequences, the flashback was less convincing and engaging for me. There could‚Äôve been better reasons/writing in the second half but it was meh üòë

Parthi - ‚ÄúIndha kadhayila ratchasa mugama‚Äù that's him! that's him! üëøüí• a classy, Wit, and protective family man scares me more bro! Parthiban gonna be one of the memorable characters of Vijay.

‚ÄúMaster‚Äù had VJS but even the super cool Arjun and Sanjay Dutt couldn‚Äôt provide much. But the Mysskin-Sandy dynamic is interesting even if brief. It could‚Äôve been much more compelling if the villains had at least a semblance of proper character arcs and build-up.

Kudos to the exceptional stunt choreography, and Ani‚Äôs music continued to shine, as expected.üî•

This is undeniably a superior Vijay film when compared to his recent works. Average stuff for Loki‚Äôs standards. There are only two installments left for the LCU endgame. I hope Loki will come up with greater stories to end this universe.

In short, 
Is it worth your penny?
Definitely!

instagram,"Elephant herds are in a constant state of motion. To find the huge amounts of water and food they need to survive, these massive mammals must keep moving. In Botswana's Okavango Delta ‚Äì home to the world's largest elephant population ‚Äì life is governed by the seasonal ebb and flow of annual floodwaters. Herds trek across this vast swathe of bushveld in great numbers as they follow ancient migratory pathways etched into the earth by generation after generation of grey giants. Although populations are relatively stable in this part of the world, herds are still threatened by conflict with humans as they stray out of protected areas. A recent survey indicates a high mortality rate for elephants in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA). The reasons for this are not yet fully understood, but factors such as poaching, habitat loss, human-elephant conflict and disease may play a role. One thing is clear: if we hope to peacefully share space with elephants, we need to find conservation solutions that benefit both people and wildlife. ‚Å£‚Å£

The lives of millions of children have been disrupted by the devastating conflict and many have witnessed the destruction of their homes, schools and familiar spaces and are now grappling with fear and trauma.

Despite challenges, our colleagues from @unicef  are on the ground, delivering life-saving assistance, including medical supplies, safe drinking water and nutrition support.

Specialized teams have also been deployed to provide psychosocial counseling, learning opportunities, and protection to the most vulnerable children.

A day after Colombian President Gustavo Petro threatened to suspend relations with Israel due to their decision to halt security material exports to Colombia in response to his Middle East crisis stance, Foreign Minister Alvaro Leyva asked Israeli Ambassador Gali Dagan to ""apologize and leave"".

Using his X account, Leyva demanded respect for the president and accused Dagan of being ""rude.""
‚ÄúThe history of universal diplomacy will record as a milestone the senseless rudeness of Israel's ambassador in Colombia towards President Gustavo,‚Äù Leyva published on X. ‚ÄúShame on him. He should at least apologize and leave. Intelligence is confronted with intelligence. There are States at stake.‚Äù

This statement from Leyva intensifies an already elevated state of diplomatic tension between Colombia and Israel.
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously summoned Colombia's ambassador and reprimanded her for ""hostile and anti-Semitic"" comments by President Petro, who has refused to condemn the recent attack by Hamas on Israel, despite pleas from the Israeli government and the United States to do so.

Dagan has been responding to Petro's posts since the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Petro declared his refusal to ‚Äúsupport genocides‚Äù and pledged humanitarian aid to Gaza, where thousands have lost their lives in retaliatory airstrikes by Israel.
Israel confirmed the decision to stop sending arms ammunition to Colombia even though a good part of the weapons used by the Colombian Armed Forces including rifles, Kfir planes, anti-aircraft batteries, tanks and radars, drones, Spike type missiles used in harpy helicopters, armored vehicles, ammunition, mortars and maritime systems, come from Israel.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

The missiles were allegedly launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants involved in a conflict in Yemen. According to one official, ‚Äúapproximately 2-3 missiles‚Äù were intercepted.

Defense Department secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that the USS Carney shot down three missiles as well as several drones launched by the Houthi forces Thursday afternoon.

‚ÄúThis action was a demonstration of the integrated air and missile defense architecture that we built in the Middle East and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interest in this important region,‚Äù Ryder said at a presser. ‚ÄúThere were no casualties to US forces and none that we know of to any civilians on the ground.‚Äù

instagram,"British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak landed in Israel on 19th October, a Reuters witness said, beginning a visit in which he will meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog before travelling on to other regional capitals.

According to his office, Sunak will share his condolences for the lives lost in Israel and Gaza as a result of the attack on Israel on October 7 by Gaza-based Palestinian Hamas gunmen and will issue a warning against further escalating the violence in the area.

""Every civilian death is a tragedy. And too many lives have been lost following Hamas‚Äô horrific act of terror,"" Sunak said in a statement ahead of his visit.

He said a deadly blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday, which killed hundreds of Palestinians, should be ""a watershed moment for leaders in the region and across the world to come together to avoid further dangerous escalation of conflict"", pledging Britain would be at ""the forefront of this effort"".

Sunak will also call for the opening of a route so that Egyptian humanitarian aid can enter Gaza as quickly as possible and so that British nationals who are stuck there can escape.

The Path to Peace: A world flawed by conflict often leads us to confine the dove, symbolizing peace, within a cage. However, it is high time we free the essence of peace and contain the destructive power of missiles instead. We are translating this powerful concept into an artistic costume, aiming to convey a profound message of peace, a sentiment deeply ingrained in Nepal's identity as a peace-loving nation. Nepal represents peace through its longstanding commitment to non-violence, its peaceful coexistence with diverse cultures, and its status as a neutral and harmonious nation. The costume is meticulously designed in colors that resonate with the choices of peace advocates, symbolizing their unwavering commitment to the cause of peace. The headgear represents a cloud in the sky, filled with missiles.

instagram,"Minnesotans waved Palestinian flags on the steps of the State Capitol Wednesday evening to demand a ceasefire in Gaza, where thousands have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in recent days.

The event, ""Stand with Palestine,"" drew about 1,000 people. It featured speakers who demanded an end to Israel's 75-year-long occupation of Palestine, and criticized local officials for their response to the conflict. That included Gov. Tim Walz, who received criticism at the rally for several high-profile shows of support for Israel.

Sana Wazwaz, a chapter lead from American Muslims for Palestine, said the group condemns Walz for his actions so far in the conflict. ""We call on him to and we implore him to understand the need for an immediate ceasefire and to make a public call to do so,"" Wazwaz said in an interview.

Walz's comments and actions in support of Israel have been similar in tone and content to most high-profile Democratic Party leaders. The conflict has exposed divisions between some on the party's left and moderate flanks. Tap the link in our bio to read the full report by Louis Krauss.

instagram,"On November 29, 1947 the United Nations adopted Resolution 181 (also known as the Partition Resolution) that would divide Great Britain‚Äôs former Palestinian mandate into Jewish and Arab states in May 1948 when the British mandate was scheduled to end. Under the resolution, the area of religious significance surrounding Jerusalem would remain a corpus separatum under international control administered by the United Nations.

Although the United States backed Resolution 181, the U.S. Department of State recommended the creation of a United Nations trusteeship with limits on Jewish immigration and a division of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab provinces but not states. The State Department, concerned about the possibility of an increasing Soviet role in the Arab world and the potential for restriction by Arab oil producing nations of oil supplies to the United States, advised against U.S. intervention on behalf of the Jews. Later, as the date for British departure from Palestine drew near, the Department of State grew concerned about the possibility of an all-out war in Palestine as Arab states threatened to attack almost as soon as the UN passed the partition resolution.

Despite growing conflict between Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews and despite the Department of State‚Äôs endorsement of a trusteeship, Truman ultimately decided to recognize the state Israel.

instagram,"""We must mobilize against the carnage being inflicted on the Palestinian people. A new Nakba is entirely possible ‚Äî the conditions are there. Israel has already ordered the population of northern Gaza to go to southern Gaza, even though it sometimes bombed them along the way. There is no safe passage for the population to move. The population has been starved of water and food, and there is no electricity.‚Å£
‚Å£
During the first week of Israeli bombing, Israel dropped more bombs on Gaza than the United States dropped on Afghanistan in a year. The scale is not only horrific, but genocidal. I don‚Äôt use that word lightly in any way, and I have never used it before in relation to the Palestinian conflict before because the previous wars were much less savage than the one we are currently seeing.‚Å£
‚Å£
How are people meant to survive? They don‚Äôt have food to eat. If you prolong this and if you block the supply of electricity for hospitals, what do you expect will happen in Gaza? Tens of thousands of people will die.‚Å£
‚Å£
A new Nakba is already here. There is no way for them to go to safety and then come back to their homes. The natural thing in war is to go to a place of safety until the insecurity is over and then for you to be able to return home.‚Å£
‚Å£
Of course, Palestinians are always afraid of leaving their homes, so there is that emotional and psychological pressure. If you leave northern Gaza, will you be able to return, or will Israel simply declare it to be a closed military zone?‚Å£
‚Å£
Israeli leaders have made statements about totally changing the way Gaza looks ‚Äî what does that mean, exactly? They have spoken about changing the whole landscape of Gaza and inflicting a cost that will be remembered for generations to come. Again, this is genocidal language.‚Å£
‚Å£
It‚Äôs very hard to tell how this is going to end. It depends on how much political pressure is put on Israel and how much popular pressure there is against the war, how many people come out in demonstrations ‚Äî all of these factors. You cannot predict these things.""‚Å£

instagram,"A blood libel is an anti-Jewish trope, rooted in very dangerous lies. Blood libels throughout history especially in the Middle Ages were used to justify the massacre of Jews. See any similarities ? 

A message to my Palestinian Neighbours,  Be very careful who you thinks is supporting you.The moment it was verified that PIJ ¬†bombed the Al-Ahli¬† hospital many were quick to drop the story. Why?
¬†
The rocket that was aimed to murder Israeli civilians ended up murdering Palestinian civilians.
Our common enemy is Hamas.
¬†
The lack of outrage over this misinformation also reveals a disconnect between Palestinians in the diaspora and Gaza.¬† Gazans know that the common enemy is Hamas who murders their own and this is not the first time.
¬†
Our liberation is connected and if there is anyone who doesn‚Äôt want war it is Jews and Israelis who are also mourning, not Karen who is hashtaging away on the way to yoga sipping matcha.
Think - is your goal to convince people to hate Israel or to¬† truly¬† rise above this conflict?

A profound self-destructive lie the anti-Israel world propagates is that Jews are ‚Äúcolonizers‚Äùto our homeland. During war this  MORE Jews flock to Israel than try to leave. That‚Äôs the attitude of an lndigenous People. Accept this fact so we can begin to transcend this cycle of war.",,3167,"{'like_count': 3057, 'comment_count': 110, 'num_users': 29771}",Y S A B E L L A   E L I S H E V A    ◊ê ◊ú ◊ô ◊© ◊ë ◊¢,,2023-10-19 17:35:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/371453564_303790005633633_3569227555407260400_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=6F1Xbbb8w24AX-Ode4g&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDk1MY9b61GMLAbafLWe94cikmyv7yjEPmFOKLOfN4mmw&oe=6559B041,https://www.instagram.com/p/CylsbjNOC_f/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393271447_905864307634233_6188474489995720182_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nM3sHj73zlwAX85CV5a&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBaC2WgUwJqr5jc-YMrlFcumTV4WLusSeFEEwz1WrUC3g&oe=65594EFD

A sizeable number attended the prayers with their children in response to the organizers‚Äô appeal to the community to express solidarity and make dua for the safety of the people who are in distress.

Apart from Qunoot-e-Nazila prayers, several silent protests or flash protests are being regularly organised in Hyderabad in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah conflict that started this month.

A flash protest was also held recently at Shahalibanda. Another small silent protest was held near Charminar with youth holding placards standing silently to express their solidarity.

Qunoot-e-Nazila is a special prayer by Muslims performed during calamities that befall the community. It is preferable to perform it during Fajr prayers (namaz before dawn) but can be performed during any five obligatory prayers.

instagram,"DOD assets in the Red Sea, Iraq and Syria responded to missile and drone attacks over the past two days, as U.S. service members look to deter groups from using the Israel-Hamas war as an opportunity to launch conflict that could engulf the region, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said today.

Ryder also spelled out the steps Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III has taken to strengthen DOD posture in the region to bolster regional deterrence efforts.

Ryder said the crew of the guided missile destroyer USS Carney operating in the northern Red Sea earlier today shot down three land attack cruise missiles and several drones launched by Houthi forces in Yemen. ""This action was a demonstration of the integrated air and missile defense architecture that we built in the Middle East and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interests,"" he said. 

There were no casualties. 

""We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched heading north along the Red Sea potentially towards targets in Israel,"" the general said. 

Ryder also detailed drone attacks on U.S. facilities in Syria and Iraq. The al-Tanf garrison in Syria was targeted by two drones on Oct. 18. ""U.S. and coalition forces engaged one drone destroying it while the other drone impacted the base resulting in minor injuries to coalition forces,"" Ryder said. All of the injured returned to duty. 

At the same time, early warning systems indicated a possible threat approaching the airbase at al-Assad. Base personnel sheltered in place as a protective measure.

Separately in northern Iraq, U.S. forces engaged and destroyed a drone resulting in no injuries or damage. 

Ryder said he will not detail what the American response to these provocations will be. ""I will say that we will take all necessary actions to defend U.S. and coalition forces against any threat,"" he said.

instagram,"Putrajaya will not send troops to Palestine but will focus instead on humanitarian assistance to Palestinians who are affected by the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim warned against provoking the matter, saying it is important for the country to work with the Middle East states, which should ‚Äúplay the prominent roles‚Äù.

‚ÄúSome insist we should send our armed forces but that is not what we will consider for now.

‚ÄúOur focus is humanitarian assistance,‚Äù he said at an event at the Seri Perdana Complex, Putrajaya, where he witnessed corporate contributions to the humanitarian trust fund for the people of Palestine.

He said the government had approved RM10 million, and the contributions collected from companies had come to around RM81 million. He said the government expected to reach its goal of collecting RM100 million in the near future.

instagram,"In the heart of one of the world's most enduring conflicts lies Gaza, a place that has come to symbolize the deeply entrenched struggle between Palestinians and Israelis. The Gaza Strip is a tiny enclave with heavily controlled borders that is home to over two million Palestinians, and its people endure hardships that few outsiders can comprehend.

The current conflict, which was initiated by a terrorist organization, is but the latest installment in a cycle of violence that in its most recent phase was initiated in 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. Gaza has in fact been built up, destroyed and repopulated by a long list of conquerors and empires over a period of more than one hundred generations. For these thousands of years, a deep-seated karmic pattern of violence and vengeance has been reinforced, a pattern that promotes more of the same in each ensuing generation and discourages any kind of meaningful arrangement that could bring a lasting peace.

The deliberate torture, rape, and murder of hundreds of helpless Israeli civilians, with children at school, the elderly and babies specifically targeted, was a heinous crime. Hamas did this to deliberately provoke an overreaction, one that they are praying will be so excessive that another generation will become sufficiently radicalized and fanatical to perpetuate the pattern. That countless of their own people will die means nothing to them.

But indiscriminately massacring innocent Palestinians in retribution would be monstrous as well, and given the reality that Gaza has a population of more than two million squeezed only a mere 365 square kilometers, making it one of the densely populated places on Earth, any major Israeli military incursion is bound to result in huge Palestinian casualties [con‚Äôd in comments]",,2919,"{'like_count': 2822, 'comment_count': 97, 'num_users': 131706}",Dr. Robert Svoboda,,2023-10-19 01:17:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/71169544_391805294848859_5018877097368616960_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=y4J1DJk_cVEAX8M6qtS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBKkMksNxZEGXePgSYR6O2UU6SvoTfnbp4PSkMY_xTC-w&oe=655A53B9,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyj8iwWr3KT/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393576015_843760517424415_960196032660927026_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ihcVS32yjq4AX-CFLKb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBYHonvQmU590p4A2CQHX2Ny9dKSdpBUXn3jmJSnWHPRA&oe=655A7390
instagram,"My first impressions of Saranda, Albania: ‚ÄúUhh this looks...interesting.‚Äù Which is my polite way of saying, ‚ÄúWhat on earth is going on here?‚Äù

After we got docked in Saranda, I walked by abandoned buildings, dodged broken glass along pseudo -sidewalks (if we can even call them that), all while catching just the most delightful whiffs of fishy garbage.

Enter my newfound friend Ari, a local Albanian guide and historian, basically the ringleader of my Albanian odyssey and why I wanted to give Albania a genuine chance.

With Ari, I got immersed into the best of Albania‚Äôs heritage‚Äì his family rolled out the red carpet of Albanian hospitality. His wife had the day off of work so she toured around with us. His mother-in-law greeted me with the biggest hug and kiss, as if I was their long-lost family member.

Shaped by thousands of years of conflict and resilience, Ari taught me so much about the Illyrians, and showed me how much Albania has changed since emerging from a cruel and repressive regime in the 1990s. We talked about the good and the bad as we drove around to his favorite beaches, ancient sites, and delicious food spots.

Moral of the story: First impressions can be deceiving.

A heartfelt thanks to Ari and fam, who laid the foundation for an epic summer living and working remotely from Albania.

Concerns were only heightened by the news last weekend that a six-year-old boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, was stabbed to death in the US, reportedly because he was a Muslim. ‚Å†

‚Ä¢ Jordan‚Äôs foreign minister said he believed the ‚Äúworst is coming‚Äù with regards to the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip.

instagram,"Hamas is the new Nazis and ISIS, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. UK absolutely supports Israel's right to go after Hamas, Rishi Sunak said.
A day after US President Joe Biden pledged solidarity with Israel, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday said the United Kingdom absolutely defends Israel's right to defend themselves in line with international law and to go after Hamas to take back hostages, deter further incursions and to strengthen Israel's security for long term. At the joint press conference, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Rishi Sunak for 'clear, unwavering support' since the day the war began. ""I think the fact that you came to Israel does mean a lot. I said this to President Biden yesterday that there is one thing more heartwarming than standing by Israel and that is standing in Israel,"" Netanyahu said.
Calling Hamas the new Nazis, the new ISIS, Netanyahu said the fight is now not only Israel's but the world's fight against the 'Nazis'. ""Hamas are the new Nazis, they are the new ISIS and we have to fight them together, just as the world, the civilised world united to fight the Nazis. This is not merely our battle, but the battle of the entire civilised world,"" Netanyahu said.
Netanyahu held a private meeting with Sunal at his office in Jerusalem as Sunak reached Israel amid the ongoing conflict between the Israeli forces and Hamas that started on October 7. ""I am in Israel, a nation in grief. I grieve with you and stand with you against the evil that is terrorism. Today, and always,"" Sunak said. Netanyahu told Sunak that the aim of the October 7 attack by Hamas was to destroy Israel's regional peace moves. Rishi Sunak welcomed Israel's decision to allow aid in Gaza.

instagram,"A major part of our worlds healing process is to continue to support healthy forms of Masculine and Feminine energy as we set the necessary boundaries with distorted versions.

It is important to begin to bring conscious awareness to distorted versions of the Masculine and Feminine, and it is equally important to empower the rise of healthy energies.

Instead of just tearing each other down, pointing the finger, or shaming, we all must do the healing work so that we can calmly and effectively set boundaries with toxic/distorted/manipulative/hurtful behaviors from others, while continuing to take responsibility for our own wounds; offering love, support, and understanding to those who are actively working on themselves as well.

Healing the conflict within ourselves and in our relationships is one major way we can bring more peace to our world.

instagram,"The contrasting World reaction to the missile strike on a Gaza Strip hospital could not be more stark. African leaders accuse Israel of targeting the facility and killing hundreds of Palestinians. They demand an end to hostilities and say Tel Aviv is guilty of war crimes and genocide. The EU, France, Britain and the USA (who voted against a Russian-tabled UN resolution for a ceasefire just before the hospital attack) say they are ‚Äòsaddened‚Äô and want an investigation to ‚Äòestablish‚Äô the facts. Israel denies the atrocity, blaming it on a misfired rocket from Gaza. 
However, some military analysts believe only Israel has such powerful weapons in this conflict. We‚Äôve put together statements by governments and leaders in the wake of the horror. Read them and give us your response.

This slight relenting in horror is thanks to the United States' barely conscious president deciding to take a brief pause from banging the drum for genocide. The US could make this stop tomorrow by turning off the supply of arms and money that allows a small country like Israel to have such a powerfully violent military machine, and which prevents it from ever seeing anything except a military solution to its problems. But they won't. Already GOP politicians are trying to reroute the US' Palestinian aid into replenishing Israel's Iron Dome.

instagram,"The Israeli army uses Palestinian children as human shields: 

The Defence for Children International (DCI) is a famous NGO that seeks to help alleviate the suffering of children across the world. Its Palestinian section is located in Jerusalem. The DCI investigated into how children were used during the Israel-Palestine war. The results were unexpected.¬† 

Quotations from the report:¬† 

‚ÄúThe recruitment and use of children in armed conflict is prohibited under international law‚Ä¶The prohibition also includes using children as human shields against possible attack‚Ä¶The report covers an eight year period between 2004 and 2011 (the reporting period)‚Ä¶During the reporting period, DCI, and other human rights organisations, have documented 17 cases of Palestinian children being used as human shields by Israeli forces.The practice of using human shields involves forcing civilians to directly assist in military operations or using them to shield an area or troops from attack. Civilians are usually threatened and/or physically coerced into performing these tasks, most of the time at gunpoint‚Ä¶In 16 out of the 17 cases involving the use of Palestinian children as human shields, the event occurred after a ruling by the Israeli High Court of Justice declared the practice illegal under domestic law. This would suggest that the Israeli army is either ignoring the court‚Äôs judgment, or not properly ensuring compliance with its ruling. It is also significant to note that in only one case was anybody held accountable for using a child as a human shield‚Ä¶¬†¬π 

Since the High Court‚Äôs ruling in 2005, lawyers and human rights organisations, including DCI, have submitted a number of complaints in relation to the use of children by the Israeli army as human shields. In one case, a nine-year-old boy was used as a human shield during the war in Gaza in January 2009‚Ä¶‚Äù¬≤

instagram,"Manipuri‚Äôs biggest societal fest, Ningol Chakkouba likely to be a victim of conflict

Waari Singbul Network | Oct 19, 2023

Imphal: Owing to the unceasing ethnic strife besetting Manipur, Ningol Chakkouba, the biggest festival of Manipuri women may not be celebrated in earnest.¬†Noticeably, many individuals and locals organisations in the state have taken their decision not to celebrate Chakkouba this time.

Hordes of¬†Meitei civil bodies of the state also appealed to forgo the festival that falls on November 15 taking into account¬†the unstable state of affairs triggered by the violence.

On Chakkouba day, the age-old festival, Meitei women, particularly the married ones, in their best traditional attires, move to their natal homes and enjoy multi dishes with their parents and siblings.

With simple gifts and blessings given by their parents and brothers, the Ningols (women) return home with high spirits. Entertainment programmes like music concerts, Shumang Leela (courtyard theatre) etc. are also held on Chakkouba day.

The festival has encompassed other communities since the last few decades, standing as testimony of love, unity and integration in the state. An irony to what is happening with over 175 people killed, 1108 injured and rendered around 60,000 homeless and sheltered in relief camps. Over thousands of houses and other properties have been destroyed since the ethnic conflict broke on May 3.

‚ÄúHad there been no violence in our state we would have by now planned everything for the ensuing Ningol Chakkouba like¬† the fish menu for the family feasting and the simple gift items to be given to
our married daughters and beloved¬† Ningols (women),‚Äù said Saikhom Ongbi Tombi Devi, a resident of Thangmeiband area in Imphal West district.

‚ÄúWhen the bereaved families are weeping for their near and dear ones killed, injured and maimed¬† in the unceasing conflict, when the people whose houses and properties were destroyed by miscreants and taking refuge at relief camps and when the people are bearing the brunt of the public unrest, there will¬† be no happiness in Ningol Chakkouba. Hence, we have decided to forgo the festival this time,‚Äù she added.",,1730,"{'like_count': 1722, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 69414}",Manipur Times,,2023-10-19 13:05:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11189884_452811628206739_1239030176_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=YEFrCVcsTQAAX953Gc2&_nc_oc=AQmgLZKpaEiFczWkw3cHqDLaTqLp-CNfLxIX5Kcco1JAv-76GjN7F5bpEW7pNQwF6-8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDIjqUT5A2AZlwldnBG13h5qigEkqHzZ1KYgM6xOncZCw&oe=6559BC36,https://www.instagram.com/p/CylNm0lRe1e/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393994775_338564895510799_765269907860087932_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=jyTQOOx8lI8AX_rR0tV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBaYe5E0SRlR3G_nZOSXsRXf6NqHzTmpOXgREmt7bIDIw&oe=65450665
instagram,"India's aviation industry has been experiencing a resurgence, with air traffic reaching new highs and indicating a promising outlook for pilots who weathered the storm of the pandemic. However, beneath the surface, a less rosy picture emerges as the relationship between pilots and airline management becomes increasingly strained, particularly within Air India, which underwent a change in ownership almost two years ago.
Since Tata Sons took over Air India, the relationship between the airline's pilots and the new management has hit an all-time low. It is no secret that senior pilots have often struggled to find a sense of belonging within the organisation they serve, given the unique nature of their profession. 
Senior pilots in Air India have been vocal about their grievances, frequently sharing their concerns on platforms like WhatsApp. Insiders suggest that the ""diminishing status"" of pilots and crew members has been ""a deliberate tactic aimed at alienating these critical staff members"". 

Insiders from the airline also allege that the pilots were displaced from high-ranking roles, including positions like chief of operations, which subsequently ignited a conflict with the management.
While the Tata management has concentrated on the aesthetics and quality of service, there appears to be a pressing need to address deeper issues within the organisation.
Sources from the ministry of civil aviation (MOCA), assert that Tata should have replaced the old management team with a fresh one soon after taking control. The retained management, with its existing ways of doing things, is viewed as a destabilising influence, continuing to fuel the infighting within the airline.
Air India has long suffered from the existence of factional camps, each often motivated by self-interest rather than the airline's well-being. Retaining the old management has inadvertently perpetuated these divisions, intensifying the adversarial relationship between different employee groups and management.

Where do I get to do what I really wanted to do?‚Äô says Shahid. His role model then was Aamir Khan who wowed ‚Äúby doing unconventional stuff which was commercially loved‚Äù. That opportunity finally came his way with Imtiaz Ali‚Äôs Jab We Met. It was a role passed on by others but Shahid tapped into the vulnerability and internal conflict of a young man who seemingly has everything. In turn, audiences saw a whole new side of Shahid, one that‚Äôs understated and yet so effective.

instagram,"Pakistan Thursday dispatched the first consignment carrying relief assistance to Gaza as Israel's indiscriminate bombardment continues on the Hamas-ruled strip, killing thousands and displacing millions.

The relief assistance, carrying one thousand winter tents, four thousand blankets, and three tonnes of medicines, will reach Palestine via Egypt in a chartered aircraft, the Foreign Office said in a statement.

Israel's unabated airstrikes on Gaza have claimed nearly 3,500 lives while thousands of others are injured. Entire city blocks have been levelled, water, food, and power have been cut off, and over one million people have been displaced.

Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel has claimed more than 1,400 lives ‚Äî and the conflict has set off a wave of fury across the Middle East against Israel and its Western allies.

At the media briefing today, FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan remains deeply concerned about the situation of ""our Palestinian brothers and sisters"" in Gaza.

‚ÄúWe strongly condemn the Israeli aggression and blockade, particularly the recent attack on a Gaza hospital. Israel's actions violate international humanitarian and human rights law,‚Äù she added.

The FO spokesperson further said deliberate attacks against civilian targets constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.

‚ÄúWe call for an immediate ceasefire; an end to the siege of Gaza; and the facilitation of humanitarian corridors for unrestricted relief supplies.‚Äù

The development came as Israel agreed on a deal for an initial 20 trucks carrying relief goods to cross the shuttered Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza, with the first deliveries expected Friday at the earliest.

More than 100 trucks carrying aid goods have been queued for days on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing, the only entry or exit point to Gaza not controlled by Israel.

Cairo has so far kept it closed, pointing to repeated Israeli strikes near the crossing and voicing fears that Israel may be hoping to permanently drive Palestinians out and into Egypt¬¥s Sinai desert.

instagram,"üí≠OPINION SECTION | It‚Äôs what politicians do.

Chaos breaks, and they chime in, state their stance in the glare of cameras, play the role of statesman.

But in the case of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the political ritual extends further. Every occasion, no matter how tragic and complex, is an opportunity to advance his hard-right Republican presidential ambitions.

As DeSantis desperately tries to carve himself a spot in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, he declares Palestinians ‚Äúall antisemitic‚Äù and says the United States shouldn‚Äôt take in any of the Palestinians displaced from Gaza.

His lack of thoughtfulness in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel is deplorable.

He fans the flames of division at home, lighting matches in the fresh wound of heartbreak and war. It has been his trademark as Florida‚Äôs governor. He exploits outrage, pain and fear to highlight his extremist agenda ‚Äî and score political points with the Trump base of white-nationalist voters. #opinion #column #desantis

instagram,"The Albanese government will expedite a new national racism strategy amid rising community tensions triggered by the war between Israel and Hamas, and the defeat of the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum last Saturday.

The minister for multicultural affairs, Andrew Giles, told Guardian Australia‚Äôs politics podcast there is a ‚Äúrenewed sense of urgency‚Äù about launching the new anti-racism campaign ‚Äúgiven the events of recent weeks‚Äù.

Asked how concerned he was about social cohesion in Australia in the wake of the polarising referendum campaign and domestic anxieties about the Middle East conflict, Giles replied: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very concerned.‚Äù

The government has been working with the Australian Human Rights Commission to set the foundations of an anti-racism strategy. Giles said ‚Äúsome research has gone into how we best go about it and how we best engage Australians who, in the context of busy lives, may not have the bandwidth to think through some of these issues in detail‚Äù.

‚ÄúI think that is a big lesson of recent politics around the world ‚Äì that we have got to understand how all the pressures and dimensions of an individual‚Äôs life impact on their willingness or capacity to engage in issues ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got to be where people are, not where we want them to be.‚Äù

instagram,"October 19, 2005, Haifa Israel (18 years ago today)
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
Ori & I took Ruby to meet her maternal great grandparents, Bella & Isaac, upon her turning one years old. We felt it was important to make this trip since they were already in their 90‚Äôs.
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
On this particular day we spent the afternoon just chatting with them. Their English was not great and my Hebrew, nonexistent, so Ori acted as translator and I was the one asking the questions. 
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
Ori‚Äôs grandfather shared about how they fled Poland right before the Holocaust and how lucky they were to survive. Sadly, their siblings were not so lucky and did not make it. 
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
I wanted to post this photo and have it live on my feed because it is part of my children‚Äôs story, it is their lineage. Their grandparents, (Ori‚Äôs parents), were first generation Israelis. I cannot help but think how devastated Issac & Bella, people that escaped the Holocaust, would feel about the current state of the world. 
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
The internet has gone mad with people becoming geopolitical experts overnight, even though they have never been to this region nor have any affiliation with it. There is name calling, sharing of stories just for clicks or for their agenda of proving they are right before they have even verified the story or the source. There are college students ripping down hostage posters in some sort of twisted act of social justice thinking some how ‚Äúthey deserved it‚Äù. There was an innocent 6 year old Palestinian American stabbed 26 times in a hate crime. 
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
This is dividing us and making an already highly fraught world, more broken. We cannot become numb to our humanity and create a competition of suffering. We need to keep educating ourselves, (me included), so we expand our hearts to everyone involved in this conflict, as we are all connected.
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
Some may ask, why it is my place to even post this. I guess in my own depth of sadness, I am hoping that I could potentially have an effect on some (even one person would be great) to consider the complexity of this situation and to strive for UNITY, UNDERSTANDING, EMPATHY & PEACE‚Ä¶I know that is a long way off but we need to start some where‚Ä¶.TOGETHER WE RISE ü´∂üèº",,1526,"{'like_count': 1437, 'comment_count': 89, 'num_users': 161220}",PATRICIA FOSTER KLEIN‚ú®Digital Content Creator & Fashion Stylist,,2023-10-19 19:51:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/339483732_1220708328817946_4472967366117826367_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Xk7wpL76peEAX8vngLI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCvBjevAahvKSyBUXrMaK1nXqMYHsVR_bQu5QZsJS1HvQ&oe=655B11A8,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyl7-CnAJs9/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393367027_3475272029357596_6483668493884471767_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=bwVxezXJsFcAX8aKB74&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCik96qi-77eJLPr6whyE-jmsc1hmfojXPKMxdZT9vWFA&oe=65591FB0
instagram,"The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak is set to embark on a visit to Israel later on Thursday, where he will meet with the top leaders to discuss the country's ongoing war with Hamas, and express solidarity, Reuters reported citing the UK PM's office.

According to his office, Sunak will meet Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog and will share his condolences for the loss of life in Israel and Gaza as a result of the October 7 attack on Israel.

""Every civilian death is a tragedy. And too many lives have been lost following Hamas' horrific act of terror,"" Sunak said in a statement ahead of his visit, according to Reuters.

Moreover, as per Reuters report, Sunak will call for the opening up of a route to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza as soon as possible and to make it possible for British nationals trapped in Gaza to depart.

instagram,"Whet Sheikh Gumi should understand is that if twins are separated at birth and adopted by a Christian and Muslim family, respectively, they will grow up and likely take their parent‚Äôs religion. That is why we must stop hating people based on their religion. People mostly don't choose their faith. It chose them. Most people are just a product of parental conditioning. That is why they say things like ‚ÄòI was born a Christian' or 'I was born a Muslim‚Äô. You were not born as an adherent of any religion. You entered this world with only one identity, which is the identity of a human being. It is on Earth you met religion. And you will leave it here. Because there is no religion in heaven except love! 

Sheikh Gumi's statement about not trusting Christians with Nigeria's security is regrettable and disturbing. We have come together as a country for 63 years, and this type of statement sets us back and builds distrust. We need competence and patriotism to tackle insecurity, not religious bias. Did Sheikh Gumi experience the kind of insecurity he saw in Kaduna under Nasir El-Rufai during the administration of Patrick Yakowa, a Christian? That, right there, disproves his theory. 

How can he think that Wike will make the FCT an extension of Israel and people with beards will be killed? That type of thinking is unfounded. Wike has no power over the Army, Navy, Air Force, or the Paramilitary Forces. Those are squarely under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, who is a Muslim, like Gumi. 

We have, to a large extent, successfully managed our diversity in Nigeria, and it will be most helpful if we do not allow the conflict in Palestine and Israel to cause us to hate each other. Nigeria is not Israel. Nigeria is a heterogeneous country that should serve as an example of peaceful religious coexistence to Israel if we get our acts right.

‚Ä®üé® As artists and cultural producers, our work has the power to shape public opinion. Today, as the media wages a war against truth and strips this conflict of its historical context, we have a unique responsibility to use our voice and artistic practices to say NO MORE! Now is the time to protest apartheid and amplify the just cause of the Palestinian people and their resistance against 75 years of occupation.

instagram,"What's happening: Today, on Thursday, people of Lahore took to the streets of Liberty Chowk to express their opposition to Israel's ongoing bombardment and blockade of the Gaza Strip, calling for an end to the suffering of innocent Palestinians. Lahoris came up with different sorts of posters giving out statements in favour of Palestine. The current situation in Gaza stems from an offensive initiated by the Hamas resistance group. In response, Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people, and local authorities have reported the deaths of more than 1,500 Palestinians due to the conflict.

instagram,"Western media - with their heart and soul - are trying to label all Muslims as uncivilised savages. 

If that weren‚Äôt the case, every media channel would have reported him a terrorist - the white American guy who killed a Muslim child and stabbed the mother, because the media fed him to hate Muslims and see them as terrorists. 

They completely back their governments for their support of the Israeli war crimes in Gaza. 

The media began Israel-backed propaganda that Gaza Hospital was attacked by Islamic Jihadists even before the blood of civilians dropped on the floor. 

They are using Hamas, which was created and funded by these very people, as a scapegoat to kill all in Gaza, as the West needs a strong state, Israel, in the Middle East so the Arab powers remain under their control. 

That was one reason why the US began and formulated the normalisation of ties between Israel and the Arab states - with oil reserves. 

Remember, America destroyed the second-largest oil producer on false claims of Weapons of Mass Destruction, just so it could gain access to oil - that country was Iraq - which still hasn't recovered from America‚Äôs brutal war crimes. 

Remember, the West fully backs and funds the conflict between Shia and Sunni in the Middle East - another tool to destabilise the region and so it stays in their reach. 

Media is a propaganda tool - no doubt journalists with high moral values and ethics exist, but too small in number. The media plays the role of a state agency to further the government‚Äôs vicious interests, and this is exactly what‚Äôs happening here. 

The only thing that is exposing all of this is you and me. Ordinary social media users, with no vicious interests, but to save humanity. 

Muslims and Jews have lived in peace before and they can live in peace now, but they won‚Äôt let it happen. It wasn't even about the religion, but they crafted it to be about it. 

Otherwise, you wouldn‚Äôt see Sunni states fighting Shia states. 

They have successfully destroyed peace between Islam, let alone Islam and Judaism. 

The point is, don‚Äôt be fooled by what Rishi, Joe or Benjamin say.

instagram,"Israel has blamed Palestinian Islamic Jihad for a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza City Tuesday night.
 
Hundreds of people were reported killed in the explosion at al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, which the Israel Defense Forces said was caused by a failed rocket launch by the group. Two U.S. officials also told ABC News the Pentagon independently concluded the blast was likely caused by an errant Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket that fell short of its target.
 
Palestinian officials are claiming it was the result of an Israeli airstrike.
 
Like Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad is a Gaza militant group involved in the conflict and has claimed to have taken Israelis hostages.
 
Islamic Jihad, the smaller of the two groups, is considered to be more extreme and is singularly devoted to fighting Israel, while Hamas also has sociopolitical functions as the governing body of Gaza.

He is accused of attacking a woman, an incident at the center of an alleged custody dispute involving a 10-year-old child.

The Hall County Sheriff‚Äôs Office in GA, officers responded to a 911 call from a woman on October 15 to a home, and when deputies arrived they say the woman told them Bleu (real name Jeremy Biddle) had shown up at the residence unannounced with the intent to take the 10-year-old child with him.

The woman says an argument ensued, and she told deputies Bleu picked her up and threw her to the ground, causing injuries to her right arm and hip.

EMS crews evaluated the woman for any injuries, but she refused to be transported to the hospital.

He has been released and posted a $2,400 bond.

A group of women on Thursday, October 19, organised 'Qunoot-e-Nazila' prayers at the Eidgah Hazrath Ujaleshah in Saidabad in the city.

A sizeable number attended the prayers with their children in response to the organizers‚Äô appeal to the community to express solidarity and make dua for the safety of the people who are in distress.

Apart from Qunoot-e-Nazila prayers, several silent protests or flash protests are being regularly organised in Hyderabad in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah conflict that started this month.

A flash protest was also held recently at Shahalibanda. Another small silent protest was held near Charminar with youth holding placards standing silently to express their solidarity.

What are Qunoot e Nazila prayers?

instagram,"Inzamam-ul-Haq, the former Pakistan cricket captain, is reportedly considering stepping down from his role as chief selector due to disagreements with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

Sources suggest that Inzamam is dissatisfied with the appointment of Shahid Anwar as the head coach of the U19 men's team, as he had advocated for former Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Yousaf to be given the position.
This is not the first instance of conflict between Inzamam and the PCB, as they have had differences in the past as well. Recently, Inzamam had signed a contract worth Rs2.5 million per month with the PCB.

However, the PCB has refuted these claims, with a spokesperson stating that Inzamam had actively participated in the selection process for the U19 men's team and the women's A team, and they had no knowledge of any discord between Inzamam and the board.

Earlier in the month, Inzamam was appointed as the chairman of the Junior Men's Cricket Selection Committee, adding to his existing responsibilities as the head of the senior selection committee. The senior selection committee includes Tauseef Ahmed, Wajahatullah Wasti, and Wasim Haider, while the junior selection committee consists of Aamer Nazir, Javed Hayat, Mahmood Hamid, Naveed Latif, Salman Ahmed, and Sanaullah Baloch.

In a separate development, former captain Mohammad Hafeez recently announced his resignation from the PCB Technical Committee via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), expressing his gratitude to chairman Zaka Ashraf and conveying his best wishes to Pakistan cricket. Hafeez's decision to step down from the committee came after a brief tenure of just under two months.",,1118,"{'like_count': 1089, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 294738}",Startup Pakistan,,2023-10-19 08:26:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/136657524_490579945672875_2680084267487805727_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Dn4n7bE1Jt4AX_QuMbQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCDJU5_QJ3kInKLTIHpAYRkgEtvNssNmjYLpjaO_eQWhw&oe=655B3866,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyktniOoVTq/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393464005_292420853604288_1894493221951909994_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0uhNF68N-SoAX9LdzGB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD2qVKz1PGQNKdKWmv_AvVjc5COYjFu4RhJ0itqXamaJg&oe=653597B2
instagram,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday expressed shock at the tragic loss of lives at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday night, stating that ""civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern"" and that ""those involved should be held responsible"".

Reacting to the reports that at least 500 people lost their lives in an explosion at the Saza hospital, the Prime Minister offered India's ""heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and prayers for the speedy recovery of those injured"".

While the Palestinian foreign ministry reportedly blamed Israel for the horrific attack and termed it a ""cold-blooded massacre"", Israeli ambassador to India Naor Gilon on Wednesday said that the explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza was due to a rocket fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group.

The Israeli ambassador said: ""al-Ahli hospital was hit by a rocket from the Palestinian Islamic jihad. Since the beginning of the fighting, more than 450 Palestinian-shot rockets have fallen inside the Gaza Strip. They try to hit our children, but on the way, they hit their own children. The international poison machine immediately accuses Israel. It's really a pity that many around the world are cooperating with them. But, in our technological world, everything is documented, and we have clear-cut evidence that it was a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket.""",,1084,"{'like_count': 1051, 'comment_count': 33, 'num_users': 61502}",The Express News Hyderabad,,2023-10-19 09:35:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/299654400_734560460972759_7642973483431267142_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qkVqSvILvDIAX99iHcb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAsEK4QpGddcFt7Ey_C8qWUtua_5Dyc72Cc_ZbwqmijYg&oe=655AA49F,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyk1ekzvfDI/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391651544_772325918239365_7052749694720163709_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4v7CALTM5sYAX8VE1Qj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfARRR2y21umwpTGvXgu3j6dFXXGFT414H2FwGBX3PeAKw&oe=65368B20
instagram,"At least 100 Israelis have been arrested for social media posts supporting Palestinians in Gaza and 70 remain in detention, according to a legal advocacy group in the country. Adalah, which represents Arab Israelis in human rights cases, said the arrests are part of an unprecedented crackdown on freedom of expression in Israel.

""We‚Äôre seeing things we didn‚Äôt see before,"" Adi Mansour, an attorney in Adalah‚Äôs civil rights unit, said in an interview. ""There‚Äôs a change in the perception of what is allowed and what is prevented.""

Police arrested Dalal Abu Amneh, a prominent Palestinian-Israeli singer, for ""incitement"" after her social media team posted a Palestinian flag with the caption: ""There is no victor but God,"" her lawyer told The New Arab.

Mansour said that others were arrested for posts that consisted of Koran verses, prayers for the people of Gaza and political analysis of Israeli military operations. He said that so far nobody had been charged by prosecutors, but that police had held many of them in detention for several days.

instagram,"A message to my Palestinian Neighbours, 

Be very careful who you thinks is supporting you.The moment it was verified that PIJ ¬†bombed the Al-Ahli¬† hospital many were quick to drop the story. Why?
¬†
The rocket that was aimed to murder Israeli civilians ended up murdering Palestinian civilians.
Our common enemy is Hamas.
¬†
The lack of outrage over this misinformation also reveals a disconnect between Palestinians in the diaspora and Gaza.¬† Gazans know that the common enemy is Hamas who murders their own and this is not the first time.
¬†
Our liberation is connected and if there is anyone who doesn‚Äôt want war it is Jews and Israelis who are also mourning, not Karen who is hashtaging away on the way to yoga sipping matcha.
Think - is your goal to convince people to hate Israel or to¬† truly¬† rise above this conflict?

A profound self-destructive lie the anti-Israel world propagates is that Jews are ‚Äúcolonizers‚Äùto our homeland. During war this  MORE Jews flock to Israel than try to leave. That‚Äôs the attitude of an lndigenous People. Accept this fact so we can begin to transcend this cycle of war.

instagram,"In a move sparking international concern, Azerbaijani authorities have revealed their ambitious plan to settle 140,000 Azerbaijanis in the Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) by 2026, a decision that has raised serious questions about the rights and properties of the indigenous Armenian inhabitants. Emin Huseynov, the special representative of the president of Azerbaijan, made this announcement, as reported by APA.
The timing and scale of this resettlement plan have alarmed many, given the recent history of the region. It's noteworthy that the number of Azerbaijanis proposed to be settled mirrors the quantity of indigenous Armenians who fled Nagorno-Karabakh ‚Äî 100,000 during Azerbaijan's military aggression in September 2020 and approximately 40,000 who chose not to return after the 44-day war later that year.

What intensifies the controversy is the Azerbaijani authorities' apparent willingness to resettle a substantial population in Nagorno-Karabakh while failing to address the resettlement of previously occupied territories over the past three years. This decision raises concerns about the intentions of settling Azerbaijanis in homes once belonging to forcibly displaced Armenians, potentially leading to property disputes and human rights violations.

The fact that prior to the recent conflict, the number of Azerbaijanis residing in Nagorno-Karabakh was significantly lower has not deterred the Azerbaijani authorities from pursuing their resettlement agenda.
The international community watches closely as concerns grow over the potential ramifications of this decision. Questions about the protection of property rights, the displacement of indigenous populations, and the implications for regional stability have now taken center stage. The fate of Nagorno-Karabakh's future hangs in the balance, raising critical questions about the rights and livelihoods of its former indigenous Armenian inhabitants.",,1020,"{'like_count': 948, 'comment_count': 72, 'num_users': 53210}",THE ARMENIAN REPORT,,2023-10-19 18:11:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/324592287_188950260390020_6056012698243655574_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EqMHXAcy72sAX-IXX8f&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA-muakr8pzJjpJFFjhvYTWanWCIog8dIcHLAUsnT7Qwg&oe=655A868E,https://www.instagram.com/p/CylwiAmK7Fc/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393484362_973786773713526_8430888703788217615_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=6APv7Tjw0pgAX83uI1b&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC8PtC1cVAcOthRcHshb2mEVQXgxbAN3XoFdVCNkm2Mgg&oe=6544F22A
instagram,"Are you watching the way in which Gaza is being viscerated, skinned alive, gutted and utterly crushed like an empty can of coca cola by Israeli artillery, fighter jets, bombers and state of the art long range precision bombs?

The whole thing is beginning to look like what was done to the German city of Dresden by the Allies in WW11 when the whole city was turned into nothing but a sea of rubble and what was done  to the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the Americans when a nuclear weapon was dropped on both in the same war. 

Is it not utterly frightful? Is it not like hell on earth? Is it not the worst type of nightmare that anyone can possibly experience?

Think of the screams of horror, the tears, the blood, the flying body parts, the pain, the begging, the pleading, the praying, the shouting, the mourning, the pain, the despair, the stench of death, the smell of rotting and burning flesh, the darkness, the fear, the disease, the flies, vultures and rats feeding on dead bodies, the horror, the sheer helplessnes of the people living there and the fact that they have no power to make the rain of fire and death stop. 

And all this even before the Israeli ground forces and infantry goes in for what will undoubtedly be a merciless, brutal, and unrelenting and savage ground assault and land invasion in which they will literally go street to street and house to house killing every living thing in their path.

That is the FACE and REALITY of war and no-one, no matter what side of the divide you are on or who you are supporting in this terrible conflict, should ever joke with it or take it lightly.

I personally find the whole thing heartbreaking and traumatising because we are watching human beings, including women and children, being cleaved and carved to pieces and their homes, offices, places of worship, towns, streets and loved ones blown apart from the sky.

It is enough to bring tears to anyone's eyes given the damage that is being done and the innocent lives that are being lost.

Only a monster would relish such a sight, no matter how justified you may think it is.

Gazini Ganados : 

Sick to my stomach.
This has been a heartbreaking week for so many of us. Im scared, disturbed, deeply saddened. We can always be doing more.

Ive been silent regarding the conflict about the war between Israel and Palestine because as some of you may know I recently just kept in touch with my father and my family who is now living in Palestine, Gaza. 
I‚Äôve been keeping my thoughts to myself because I felt like ‚ÄúOH I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
TO FORM AN OPINION"" or ‚ÄúIM NOT THAT CULTURALLY INFORMED‚Äù.
 But it doesn‚Äôt have to end there. 
Get educated.

I would like to express my deep sorrow for the Israelis who have lost their lives and been injured in the dreadful terrorist attacks. 
Hamas killing civilians was HORRIBLE but
Israel countering by killing 10√ó more civilians is beyond insane.
 I cannot remain silent in the face of the Israeli government's attempt to seek revenge from innocent civilians for the terrorist attack. I  will not remain silent about this genocide either specially that my family‚Äôs life depends on it.

In Israel's attacks, one Palestinian loses their life every 5 minutes.
Every hour, 3 children lose their lives. Can a baby be a terrorist?

How can so many be so silent? What are you scared of? Scared to defend basic human rights as innocent people are murdered. 

It‚Äôs been a long dark tunnel since oct 7  and a long way to go to immerge from this horendous situation.

Sharing with you my conversations with my brother @hassan_2000_zxk  and stepmother @e_no0osaaa 
is by far my biggest heartbreak. üíî

‚ú®Author Collaboration‚ú®
THIS BOOK WAS ADAPTED FROM A SCRIPT! ‚¨áÔ∏è

Hello friends! The book I'm sharing today is one of the most unique I've read...possibly ever! ORIGIN'S EDGE is the first book in the Book of Men series, and it's a story with a dystopian vibe where the search for a mystical book capable of manifesting everything that is written within it goes hand in hand with an escalating conflict that could alter the fate of humanity. This story was originally written as a movie script, but the author adapted it into a novel that doesn't really read like a traditional book. Instead, it maintains a bit of that script-like quality in the writing style and the way events unfold. It takes a bit of getting used to, but I'm very invested in the intrigue! Definitely recommend if you want something unique to push you out of your comfort zone.

instagram,"üìö Unsealed Covers : A Decade of the Constitution, the Courts and the State.

Book Blurb:

In Unsealed Covers, Gautam Bhatia provides a snapshot of the Indian judiciary between 2014 and 2023. The 2014 general election saw the installation of the first majority non-coalition government in many decades (the NDA). The 2019 general election saw its return with a greater majority. It is commonly accepted that the NDA years have generated significant conflict within and around various democratic institutions meant to act as checks and balances against majoritarian power.

One of the most important theatres of conflict has been the judiciary-in particular, the Supreme Court. Critics have distinguished the Supreme Court's past assertive record with its quiescent and sometimes facilitative attitude towards the NDA government(s). Unsealed Covers provides a unique terrain where the actions of the judiciary and its relationship with the government are examined in terms of evolution and chronology. It also comments on some of the most important judgments of the past decade.

‚ÄúNo two people ever love each other the same way.‚Äù

Have you ever wanted to beg a person to stay yet yell at them to get the hell out? I know I have.

The same happens to Malcolm Gephardt when his wife Jess decides to leave on Halloween night because they need a break. After a tumultuous few years of trying everything to have a baby, Malcolm‚Äôs thrown in the towel & she‚Äôs unable to cope. Having children is her ultimate dream, but Malcolm has his own ‚Äúbaby‚Äù to worry about. His bar,The Half Moon.

‚ÄúHe should have followed her that day‚Ä¶should have stopped her from getting in her car & talked everything out with her. But he‚Äôd just let her go. Because he was shocked‚Ä¶Because his feelings were hurt‚Ä¶Because he didn‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù

They had two very different ways of handling stress, disappointment, conflict‚Äî

‚Äú[Jess] wanted a concrete solution‚Ä¶wanted a cure for grief & wanted someone to tell her where to find it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe growing sense that life was passing her by & if she didn‚Äôt do something she‚Äôd leave nothing behind to prove she was even there.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe used to ask himself what he was going to do, but the question was too large, & he had no answer, so at some point he decided to just get through each day.‚Äù

As a happy-go-lucky bartender, soon to be bar-owner, Malcolm is impulsive & jumps on what he wants. He doesn‚Äôt think of repercussions or anyone but himself. Whereas Jess, an established lawyer, takes time to sort through facts, pros & cons; how a decision effects their joint lives. All opportunities well thought out.

The two also move on without each other differently. While Malcolm keeps to himself, sticks to his routine & thinks about what he could‚Äôve done different. Jess moves on with another person, perhaps just to see how it feels to live differently. 

‚ÄúShe was the voice in his head even when she wasn‚Äôt right in front of him.‚Äù

This book is a true testament of a couple trying to survive through the devastation of infertility. 

This was a good book‚Ä¶.but S-L-O-W. Also, third person POV isn‚Äôt my fave.

instagram,"Biasanya dissenting opinion dalam putusan Mahkamah Konstitusi berisi argumen hukum yang berbeda. Tapi kali ini, dissenting opinion dalam putusan uji materi UU No. 7 Tahun 2017 terkait batasan umur capres-cawapres bernada beda. Para hakim MK yang berbeda pendapat dalam putusan ini justru menceritakan proses dan hasil putusan yang terasa ganjal bagi mereka. 

Dalam putusan ini, Ketua MK Anwar Usman yang juga ipar dari Presiden Joko Widodo ikut terlibat. Padahal di gugatan lainnya yang serupa, dia tidak ikut terlibat karena khawatir ada conflict of interest ataupun karena sakit. Komposisi putusan hakim pada gugatan ini yakni 3 hakim mengabulkan sebagian, 2 hakim mengabulkan sebagian dengan alasan berbeda, dan 4 hakim menolak dengan pendapat berbeda.

He was presented with The Pearl Sword ‚Äì a gift to the City of London from Elizabeth I ‚Äì and immediately returned it to symbolise the authority of the Lord Mayor in London‚Äôs Square Mile when the Monarch is not present.

Without mentioning the politics of division in the UK in recent years, like Brexit or Scottish independence or cancel culture, he did express his concerns about the fractious nature of the debate on social media and urged the country to engage in a more civil discourse.
Royal aides said it was a ‚Äúplea for calm and for respect‚Äù.

instagram,"Few people understand their anger or what to do with it.

We‚Äôve worked with many people in psychotherapy who have been denying their anger for decades. But repressing angry emotions is not good or helpful.

Anger is a God-given emotion. We feel angry when our will is crossed or when we‚Äôre afraid that we won‚Äôt get what we want.

Anger is not bad, it‚Äôs a natural human emotion.

Think of anger like a headache: it signals to us that something is wrong and needs attention. So if we are wise then we deal with the underlying problem‚Äîand hopefully that frees us of our anger headache!

Maybe you‚Äôre not saying no to someone or something when it is important to do so. Maybe you‚Äôre overloaded and not communicating your stress. Or you‚Äôve been hurt and need empathy.

It‚Äôs always helpful to be aware of all our emotions, including anger. The key is how we deal with our anger.

When we‚Äôre angry we may lose our temper, be passive-aggressive, or convert anger into guilt. Or we may stuff anger and live with resentment‚Äîperhaps we feel we need our anger to protect us or to give us power.

But to hold anger is to let it live in your body like cancer and it‚Äôll show up in a number of unhealthy ways.

So what can we do with our anger?

God wants us to be honest about the anger we feel when we‚Äôve been mistreated or our will has been crossed in some other way.

So for all of us, it‚Äôs important that we learn to listen to our angry feelings, express them in a safe place, speak the truth in love, set boundaries, and forgive people who offend us.

Practically, here are 3 steps to help you do this:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Be emotionally honest. Verbalize your situation of conflict and angry feelings to God and a safe friend.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set boundaries. Verbalize your limits and ask for what you need so you won‚Äôt be mistreated again.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Submit to God. Entrust justice to God by letting go of your anger and forgiving the other person. Ask the Lord to help you do the next right and loving thing.

So - I share from a place of devastation. 

I share from a place of studying conflict mediation while in grad school alongside Palestinians and Israelis 

I share from a place of knowing I will be going back to Israel at some point to help rebuild 

I share from a place of desperation that people pause for a moment and question the information they are reading before Re sharing it (one of the core themes of living a Jewish life is questioning - a powerful spiritual practice)

instagram,"""It‚Äôs safe to say the days of ‚Äòmowing the lawn‚Äô are now over. The attacks of Oct 7 were so intense ‚Äî claiming more casualties in this short timespan than the Israelis have faced in any preceding war ‚Äî that they have turned the page in this conflict forever.

What is opening up before us now is a much larger and most likely more protracted war than anything seen in the long history between Israel and Palestine. Unless diplomacy succeeds in talking the Israelis out of their ambition, the attack on the hospital in Gaza on Tuesday could be only the first of many more such atrocities to come.

This war has already started churning the streets, both in Arab as well as Western capitals. The important thing to note is that it has not even begun in earnest yet. These are the days between Sept 11 and Oct 7, 2001. The real conflict is yet to begin. How far it goes, and how much social upheaval it engenders along the way, remains to be seen ‚Äî the protagonists themselves don‚Äôt know.""

instagram,"With his daughter Rana, Abdulsamad adds flowers to the graves of the five family members he lost during the earthquake: his daughter, Ziba, 18; his son, Arif, 2; his wife Bibi Gul, 35; and two in-laws. Seven-year-old Rana was outside playing when the quake ‚Äì one of four in the span of a week ‚Äì hit. Now she collects dirt for the graves, and goes through the family remaining belongings to find what can be salvaged, picking up chickpeas one by one, while her father digs in the rubbles. 
I guess it‚Äôs impossible to convey how heart wrenching the situation of the families was; and how hard the future will be.
Like most of Zendajan district, the community of Seyad Aab village was already struggling after decades of conflict and repetitive droughts. Now the village has been almost completely destroyed and no one knows how the remaining inhabitants will survive.
¬†
The village is one of the worst hit but not an exception, thousands have died across several districts of Herat Province this month in the four earthquakes, and the loved ones who survived are left with nothing. More than 43.000 people have been directly affected in Herat province.
Although it wasn‚Äôt hit like the districts, in Herat city, people were sleeping in tents for fear another earthquakes would make their homes fall. Hospitals are overwhelmed. Humanitarian aid insufficient while thousands have no more home and the winter cold is settling.
¬†
I really have no words to describe how immense the pain and the destruction. Hoping humanitarian aid will at least limit the hardships in the coming weeks, months, but given the current situation, even before the earthquakes, it‚Äôs hard to believe it will be enough, as foreign funds dry up.

instagram,"We are in interesting times. Lines are being drawn, conflicts arise. You know we live in one of the most peaceful times in the world on a global scale compared to our past. But things seem more Chaotic than ever. 

You check the news, shooting. You check social media, a conflict has sparked, but none of them started a few days ago, they are fires that burned a little too steadily, with a little too much tension and fuel, for clearly a little too long. The world is called upon to react, emotionally, non sensibly, in a very dogmatic and tribal sense. But this is our nature isn‚Äôt it, our history, as it cycles through different tribes, empires, and peoples. 

Many things are uncertain, but one thing is for sure. If you are not going to feel the heat of the fire yourself, try not to add any fuel to it from a distance. You won‚Äôt be the one getting burned. It is a responsibility upon you to look at the big picture as much as you can, to learn, to read, to listen more than you speak perhaps, especially from those you‚Äôve never heard the perspective of before. 

Whether you wish to fight, or make peace, or understand the issue at hand. In all three cases, you most know your enemy. And even more importantly, Ask why you call him such a term. 

If you‚Äôre going to speak on enemies, moral ‚Äúevils‚Äù, and things you choose to lower the value of in your language, you best be willing to back up that talk with some risk, some courage, and some suffering. God loves a passionate man, but has less to praise in an emotional one. Learn the distinction. Choose to think logically in a time of rapid emotions. 

And so if you choose to fight, make sure it is for good reasons, good cause, and train hard, give your enemies hell, and be willing to suffer for what you believe. This is what we must demand of ourselves. 

And if not, do what you can, speak the truth, aim for peace, and speak up for those with no voice. In the meantime, pray for the peace and prepare for war, peace is possible, but it never lasts forever. May God favor the brave and bless the martyrs, and give us one ounce of their bravery.

instagram,"In conflict, couples often get stuck in a scenario where they keep defending their own viewpoints and fighting to be right. They want their partner to agree with their side. 

Remember, your perception is your reality; your partner's perception is theirs. You are both right; each just looking at it from a different angle. 

On top of that, couples often blame each other and see the other as being wrong or being the problem, believing they themselves are right. 

Remember, your partner is not the problem; you are not the problem; the problem is the problem. It can help to realize that the problem lies outside of the couple and that you are both on the same team trying to solve the same problem. 

Stop the right-fighting because when one wins, you will both lose. It is about finding a win-win solution that will work well for both. 

It is about trying to understand each other's point of view and considering both viewpoints when trying to come to a solution that will work well for both.

Keep loving!

instagram,"A U.S. State Department official announced his resignation Wednesday over the Biden administration's decision to send more arms to Israel as it carries out a massive assault on the occupied Gaza Strip, killing more than 3,400 people, decimating the enclave's civilian infrastructure, and strangling the population with an unlawful blockade.

""I cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse, and which I wholeheartedly endorse: a world built around a rules-based order, a world that advances both equality and equity, and a world whose arc of history bends towards the promise of liberty, and of justice, for all,"" Josh Paul, who spent 11 years as director of congressional and public affairs for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, wrote in his resignation letter.

Paul helped oversee the transfer of U.S. weaponry to allies, a position that he acknowledged ""was not without its moral complexity and moral compromises.""

""I made myself a promise that I would stay for as long as I felt the harm I might do could be outweighed by the good I could do,"" Paul wrote. ""In my 11 years I have made more moral compromises than I can recall, each heavily, but each with my promise to myself in mind, and intact. I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued‚Äîindeed, expanded and expedited‚Äîprovision of lethal arms to Israel‚ÄîI have reached the end of that bargain.""

Paul's resignation came hours after U.S. President Joe Biden embraced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and ""reiterated his steadfast support for Israel"" even as United Nations experts, human rights organizations, and international law scholars accuse the country of committing egregious war crimes‚Äîincluding genocide.

instagram,"have you ever been sitting in a meeting, fully focused on what is being said, when suddenly, the small being that lives inside your body kicks you square in the bladder--completely catching you off guard--so that you pee just a little bit?

this is a daily experience for me at the moment, and i weirdly love the challenge of keeping a straight face while something so intense is happening to me somatically. let's be honest, i would LOVE to be able to pause the meeting to talk about it, but i hardly think society [as a whole] is ready to embrace bodies as a part of our human experience. 

part of the hustle culture of capitalism requires us to maintain a pace that diminishes the unique experience of each of our bodies.. whether we're talking about disability, mental health, chronic pain, injury, pregnancy, etc.. the implicit expectation put on the individual is 'just keep producing, and if something is 'wrong', then handle the symptoms with a pharmaceutical and then get back to producing'.

but i'm not here to soap box about disembodied living in america.. (or am i?)

speaking of changing bodies.. i have somehow managed to make it through my pregnancy without buying any new clothes. i've been enjoying hand-me-downs and also renting from @armoire.style ‚Äî they have an incredible range of styles and sizes, including an entire maternity range, and have a super user-friendly clothing rental subscription. they're also WOC-owned! win/win/win.

also, it feels important to name the conflict going on in the world at the moment, and how it is impacting each of us in various ways. i saw a stat that said that 5,522 pregnant people are expected to deliver in the next month in gaza, and that number is separate to how many babies and children are already in the middle east and involved. the grief is real, the divided opinions are real, the information fatigue is real. take care of yourself and stay offline as much as you need to. our bodies and nervous systems are not made to consume this much conflict and tragedy--and social media does not allow for humanity and nuance, both things we so desperately need. x

instagram,"For the wounded, injured and sick in Gaza, there is seemingly no escape. On October 17, 2023, news broke that at least 500 patients, staff and people seeking shelter from Israeli bombs had been killed in an explosion at a hospital, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave.

It amounts to a devastating loss of life during a campaign of bombing that has not spared the frail or sick. Just days earlier, the World Health Organization said in a stark assessment that an order to evacuate from hospital beds and head south amounts to a ‚Äúdeath sentence.‚Äù

By that time, four hospitals had already ceased functioning in Gaza‚Äôs north because of damage from Israeli bombs.

Beyond the sheer immediate devastation of the current conflict ‚Äì in which thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed ‚Äì there will be significant and undoubtedly long-lasting implications for the Gaza Strip‚Äôs health system.

As a Palestinian expert in global health who has worked with medical professionals from Gaza, I know that even before this latest escalation of violence, health services in Gaza were in a poor shape. Insufficiently and poorly resourced for decades, doctors and hospitals also had to contend with the devastating effects of a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel, in part with coordination with Egypt.

‚ÄúDear campus community,
¬†
‚ÄúWe are increasingly concerned by the growing prevalence of online threats, doxxing, and harassment connected to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. We decry any calls for violence in any form or support for terrorism as we continue to mourn the loss of innocent life. We understand this rhetoric is creating deep fear and concern among many members of our campus community. With that in mind, we want to share an extraordinary message, written by two of our faculty, one who is Palestinian and one who is Israeli: ¬†

‚ÄúFrom: Dr. Hatem Bazian (Lecturer of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures and Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies) and Dr. Ron Hassner (Professor of Israel Studies)

‚ÄúTo our students,
¬†
‚ÄúWe are two professors on this campus who disagree, vehemently. But we have always treated one another with respect and dignity. We love this campus with its diverse communities and all of our students and are heartbroken to hear of incidents of near violence between students in recent days.

instagram,"‚ÄòThe war galloped across Luxembourg and came to a halt at the frontier.‚Äô

In the autumn of 1944, Lee Miller was following the liberation of Luxembourg for what would be an in-depth seven-page spread in both English and American Vogue. With her trusty Rollieflex camera in hand, Lee‚Äôs photographs from this time became emblematic of her journalism ‚Äì documenting the impact of conflict on civilian life. 

Here at the archives, we‚Äôve been pouring over Lee‚Äôs original draft manuscripts and correspondence. ‚ÄòThis is a very difficult piece you have sent me,‚Äô Lee wrote to her editor, Audrey Withers, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll try to put it all together for you into some sort of visual piece because it is harrowing.‚Äô Lee writes of bundles stacked in doorways ‚Äòbeing passed out of windows, falling off ridiculous carts‚Äô such as this one. 

In October 1944, Lee wrote to the censor, pleading for the material to be censored ‚Äòin advance so that I don‚Äôt break my heart and bore you with things that are un-releasable?‚Äô Sections of the article were scored through by the censor, and the story was eventually passed for publication in December.

instagram,"A culmination of years of strategy and sacrifice for a moment that changed the world, on October 19, 1781, General George Washington accepted the surrender of British General Lord Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia, effectively ending the military conflict of the American Revolution. When the war began six years earlier at the Battle of Lexington and Concord, few could have foreseen that the American colonists could defeat the powerful British Army and Navy.

In  the fall of 1781, the war was still in doubt. The British forces were divided with one army holding New York City and the other maneuvering through the southern colonies. A timely alliance brought the addition of French troops to the side of the Continental Army. Washington initially wanted to attack the British force in New York, but now supported by the French, he seized on the opportunity to move against Cornwallis‚Äôs army near Yorktown, Virginia. While the Continental Army marched south, a fleet of French ships was ordered to the area to cut off the British escape from the Chesapeake Bay. 

After combining his army with troops already around Yorktown under the command of Marquis de Lafayette, Washington began bombarding the British trenches on October 9. By October 17, Cornwallis realized he could no longer hold his position. Two days later, he signed the Articles of Capitulation, surrendering his troops to Washington on October 19. While the treaty ending the war was not signed for two more years, Cornwallis‚Äôs surrender represented the ultimate victory for the colonists and ensured American independence. 

The Washington Monument on the National Mall honors the military success of George Washington, as well as his later contributions in shaping our young nation and serving as our first president.

üßúüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü©∫

Over the past two weeks, I've been looking closely at my own child, our surroundings, and life and it feels RARE. With 400+ million kids living in war/conflict zones around the world, including all the affected innocent children caught up in Israel/Gaza, it feels like a rarity to see a child growing up without fear of violence, abuse, neglect, or food insecurity.

And even among the kids who ARE at risk, we still see their unwavering optimism. We see kids in refugee camps, amidst an imminent threat of violence, still playing soccer, doing handstands, laughing, and smiling as they talk about their dreams of attending school and eating endless sugary baked goods.

I literally have no idea where I'm going with this but I feel grateful, helpless, guilty, optimistic, anxious, and lost all at the same time. And that's normal. Take time to be vulnerable and open about it.

May we do what we can to protect and preserve the unrelenting optimism of our children.

Lessons‚Ä¶

1. Share a vision. If you‚Äôre not clear on where you want to go TOGETHER, you'll drift apart.

Plan your goals together, both business + personal.

We have a weekly mastermind together every Sunday morning to stay aligned & communicate what's working Vs. What's not.

2. Avoid Stubbornness. It's a relationship killer.

When we disagree (almost daily, lol), we strive for win-win outcomes ASAP.

The real magic of your life lies in what you‚Äôre thinking but not saying. 

^Read that again

Moralüëá
Clear the air.
Keep moving forward!

3. Understand your partner's point of view before opening your mouth. This will expand your awareness & make you an all-around better human.

4. Know each other's schedules. We share calendars so we know what we're up to. This helps with planning & time management.

5. Conflict is normal. 

Avoiding conflict is unrealistic & will set you up for failure.

When things get boring or frustrating (which they will) - communicate it. 

Don‚Äôt sit & complain. Do something about it! 

We love a good debate, lol. It helps us understand each other + always has a silver lining that serves us.

6. Men, pick up your boxers & socks always or prepare to meet DOOM!

7. Give your partner time to think, have fun, & recharge by themselves. These serve as breathing spaces.

I go shooting and fishing, don‚Äôt look at my phone for hours on end.

Claire likes to do CrossFit, shop, and go out with the girls.

Strategic time + space apart is important.

8. Never piss off one of the sisters, lol.

9. Dial in your social circle. 

Get in the proximity of role models & interesting couples doing great things.

Be ruthless with who you let into your circle.

10. Date night every week.

The first thing I plan every week is fun. I then build my other commitments around it.

- Kids minded

instagram,"Wild Diversity started as a dream. Over the years this dream has blossomed into a vision where BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities have belonging and freedom in the outdoors. Where any member of our community can see themselves out in nature radiating with joy. That vision is what we strive for every day as we work to create opportunities for interpersonal connection and deeper relationships to the outdoors. 

As an organization that believes in this dream, it is heartbreaking to witness the occupation that has been taking place for the last 75 years in Palestine. We are left speechless as we watch our Palestinian friends, family and community fight for their most basic rights and for their lives. We cannot stay silent. 

To our friends and community, we want to make it irrevocably clear that we stand with you. We stand with Palestine. 

What the world is currently witnessing is not a conflict, it is genocide and ethnic cleansing. We know that if we wish to see our dream of a world full of liberation, joy, diversity, and acceptance come true then we must fight for our community and stand against all types of injustice. 

We urge our community to come together during this time. Embrace your loved ones, mourn  these losses, and fight for our collective dream of liberation. 

Free Palestine.

instagram,"The Government of Canada has escalated its travel advisory for Lebanon, urging its citizens to ""avoid all travel"" to the country.

This update comes as a result of worsening security conditions, civil unrest, an elevated risk of terrorist activities, and the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas - along with limited skirmishes at the Lebanon-Israel border.

The advisory warns that the situation could further deteriorate without notice.

The Canadian government also cautioned that its ability to offer consular services, including the evacuation of its citizens, could be restricted in the event of an intensified armed conflict.

Canadians currently in Lebanon are advised to consider leaving the country through commercial means if it is safe to do so.

instagram,"When I checked my messages the other day, I noticed that my employees were engaged in something many of us dread: an argument.

I was drawn to this because, honestly, hindi ko talaga gusto yung feeling nung tension when there is a conflict, regardless if it's happening to me or any other person. I preferred everything to be peaceful because deep inside I thought that anything that produces unpleasant emotions like disagreements were a bad thing.

I can blame two things here:

1Ô∏è‚É£ My misunderstanding of the Law of Attraction (dapat daw positive lang)

2Ô∏è‚É£ My tendency to people please para happy happy lahat

Then, things changed when I read the book ""The Five Dysfunctions of a Team"" not long ago. 

It made me realize that healthy debates about ideas were actually a good sign for a team (team here can refer to family, friends, co-workers, intimate relationship, etc)

.. and that lack of conflict is a red flag.

Why?

Kasi hindi naman lahat sa team ay 100% agree sa sinasabi ng isa't isa. So kung walang sign ng conflict, it may mean that team members are not voicing their opinions and, in a sense, just tolerating each other.

And this bad habit of withholding our opinions to avoid conflict is where resentment often grows, and it is usually the cause of losing respect for one another in the long run. Soon, we'll find that we don't want to listen to or value that person's input anymore.

Even worse, we might find ourselves saying bad things about this person to others (even unintentionally) because we can't openly express our views within the team. Instead of addressing issues together, we share them with outsiders. This is often how the #UnproductiveMarites culture develops. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So what did I do when I saw this happening to my people the other day?

I spoke up.

Umepal ako.

I interrupted.

But not for my usual reason of stopping them because I want everyone to be happy happy.

But to tell them that what they're doing is good for the team, and that they need to keep it up. ü§†

That's when I realized that I had changed. 

That once again.. 

.. I had leveled up by a couple of points and become a better leader. üöÄ

instagram,"This book is really amazing to me - Patricia Evangelista is a trauma journalist and investigative reporter who covered state-sanctioned killings in The Philippines through the Duterte regime.

‚ÄòSome People Need Killing‚Äô is reported non-fiction but just reads so beautifully - like a first person novel full of characters and ideas that covers the worst and best of humanity. 

It‚Äôs difficult to focus on anything outside of the Israeli genocide attempts in Gaza today, but actually the impulses of domination and resistance are universal and once we believe the lie that any one life matters less than another, the through-line is clear.

Grateful to journalists like Patricia for their courage and dedication to the truth. 

So far in this phase of the occupation and conflict, Israeli forces have murdered 15 journalists.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.‚Å£
‚Å£
On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

Talk quietly and engage in slow, rhythmic movements such as swaying to music or a gentle yoga session. Don‚Äôt engage in battles at this time. Instead, retreat from conflict while you revive your spirit and become even stronger. Delay decision making at this time. You‚Äôll know exactly what to do when you emerge from your gentle retreat.

Working with Archangel Sandalphon: Sandalphon‚Äôs aura is a calming and cool shade of turquoise, like the translucent tropical ocean. Meditate upon this color, or hold the stone associated with his energy‚Äî turquoise‚Äîand feel your heart rate and breathing become quieter. Sandalphon can help your words and actions to be kind and gentle, yet powerful. As the archangel associated with music, you can feel his presence strongly when you listen to music, sing, or play a musical instrument.

instagram,"The Jamaican Government Faces Scrutiny for Deporting Haitian Asylum Seekers Amid Ongoing Conflict - The Jamaican government is under scrutiny after a third group of Haitians, who arrived on the island on Sunday, were repatriated to Haiti, a nation currently facing an ongoing war. 

Just hours after another group of Haitians sought refuge on Jamaican shores in Portland, they were promptly placed on a boat and sent back to their homeland. These Haitians, who have the right to legal representation, reportedly had limited communication with attorneys.

According to international human rights lawyer Malene Alleyne, she was at the gate of the property where the refugees were held and attempted to present an asylum request to the authorities, as requested by one of the 35 Haitians. However, Alleyne was denied access to the property.

There is ongoing global trauma and conflict. Some days are dark and can create a sense of hopelessness.

I want to remind you that you can still choose to nourish yourself.

You have permission to be informed because you have compassion, but not over exposed.

You have permission to release the judgement you may feel from yourself and others about how you‚Äôre responding.

You have permission to tap into the energy of human connection, joy, peace, and the sacredness of now without guilt or shame.

My heart and body feel the weight of what is happening in the world. There are ways to care deeply without being consumed by the news and overwhelmed by anxiety.

Give yourself a soft landing by being gentle with yourself and others during this time.

Said with love,

Menteri Koordinator Bidang Politik, Hukum, dan Keamanan (Menko Polhukam) Mahfud MD mengungkap modal yang dikeluarkannya untuk menjadi calon wakil presiden (cawapres) pendamping Ganjar Pranowo.

‚ÄúMungkin Anda tidak percaya, tapi saya jujur saya tidak keluar sepeser pun uang dan tidak diminta untuk mengeluarkan uang sepeser pun,‚Äù katanya, dikutip dari kanal YouTube SCTV, Kamis (19/10/2023).

Menurut Mahfud, perkara kontribusi materi ini menjadi alasannya selalu menampik kabar terkait dirinya menjadi kandidat kuat cawapres.

Itu menjadi alasan saya kenapa dulu ketika orang menyebut saya sebagai calon, saya lalu bilang tidak. Karena di pemahaman umum, termasuk saya, enggak punya uang ya enggak usah nyalon, gitu,‚Äù lanjutnya

Hal ini kemudian tak lagi menjadi masalah ketika koalisi pengusung Ganjar memastikan bahwa dirinya tak perlu mengeluarkan uang, karena kebutuhan negara thdp sosoknya menjadi hal yg lebih penting.

‚ÄúSemua pimpinan partai sudah mengatakan begitu, nanti uang itu ada yang ngurus sendiri. Pak Mahfud kerja saja untuk negara ini,‚Äù ujar mantan Ketua MK ini

Meskipun demikian, dirinya mengaku terkejut atas kebijakan ini, mengingat ongkos politik dalam kontestasi pemilu umumnya memakan biaya ratusan miliar rupiah hingga lebih.

Mahfud juga mengungkap bahwa Ketum PDIP Megawati Soekarnoputri secara eksplisit mengingatkan dirinya agar tak menerima sumbangan berupa uang, supaya tak tjd konflik kepentingan.

‚ÄúBagi saya sebuah surprise juga. Bahkan Bu Mega ini eksplisit mengatakan, Pak Mahfud, kalau ada orang mau nyumbang biar tidak ada conflict of interest, tidak nerima uang tunai. Soal yang lain-lain, yang resmi itu sudah ada yang menguruskan, ada bendaharanya,paparnya

Salah released a video message on his social media accounts, making his first comments on the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict after coming in for some fierce criticism in his native Egypt for staying silent on the issue for over a week.

The Gaza health ministry said at least 3,478 Palestinians have been killed and 12,065 injured in Israeli air strikes on Gaza since Oct. 7, the day Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed into Israeli towns, killing 1,400 people and taking hundreds of hostages.

instagram,"STOP THE WAR ON CHILDREN

Save the Children Philippines stands with the Philippine government and civil society in condemning the killing of civilians, including children, along with attacks on schools, hospitals, and public places in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. This is a grave violation of human rights and children‚Äôs rights, and we collectively call for those responsible to be held to account for their actions.

In the middle of this, children are always the most vulnerable and first to suffer in any conflict. With every airstrike, rocket, and bullet fired, children‚Äôs sense of security is ripped away yet again, with dire consequences for their long-term wellbeing.

They are terrified, have been forced from their homes, and are cut off from an education. If violence escalates further, children‚Äôs lives and futures will be the inevitable cost. The only way to truly protect children‚Äôs lives is to halt this violence.

instagram,"The Ultimate Confrontation: The Flower and the Bayonet 

It‚Äôs one of my favourite stories of design born from strife, hope and inspiration.

The first series of images from 1967 shows a young woman Jan Rose Kasmir, then a high school student, brazen enough to go and stare down bayonets and proffer a chrysanthemum to hostile soldiers. The photograph was taken by the famous Marc Riboud in Washington where over 100000 activists turned up to protest against the American occupation of Vietnam.
 
The second last image taken by American Bernie Boston the photo titled ‚ÄòFlower Power‚Äô 1967 was nominated  for the Pulitzer and shows a young man sticking flowers in gun nozzles. 

Both images became iconic and in 1999, Odile Lobadowsky, president of Kenzo Parfums, was inspired by Riboud‚Äôs picture and created a perfume bottle that was bayonet inspired with a lone flower inside. 

In the words of Namwali Serpell, ‚Äú‚Äòa flower stronger than a gun.‚Äô As maestro perfumer Alberto Morillas concocted the fragrance, the concept was refined: a red flower in the city, growing against a backdrop of skyscrapers and asphalt, both delicate and resilient. Kenzo introduced it in 2000 as Flower, a reminder that the autumnal day at the Pentagon three-plus decades earlier must have had a smell. Flower‚Äôs glass bottle is slender as a rifle barrel, but curved and yielding, a long-stemmed poppy seeming to float inside it. It‚Äôs so tall that stores have to display it lying on its side. The perfume smells like no particular flower and like every flower in the world combined. The marketing materials read, ‚ÄúNo one plants or chooses me. I simply grow.‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Äù (BIDOUN)

And so as our worlds turn again to the guns, it‚Äôs your choice to be the flower and choose hope.

instagram,"Perfectionism can be like a double-edged sword. On the outside, it might seem like everything is flawless, but on the inside, it's a constant battle with stress, anxiety, and fear of making any mistakes. Perfectionists tend to overthink things, worrying about what others think, which creates a lot of internal turmoil. It's a struggle between looking perfect to the world and feeling far from it on the inside.

instagram,"I‚Äôm sitting here at home while my 2 year old son naps next to me and I can‚Äôt help but have an overwhelming feeling of guilt.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all seen the same videos shared across social media of the poor innocent children that have been killed during the conflict in the Palestine that I have.

It‚Äôs all I can think about this past week.

I feel guilt.

Guilt because we are standing by watching the genocide of the Palestinian people and doing nothing about it.

How must these innocent Palestinians stuck in Gaza feel when they see and hear government leaders show their support to Israel while they are trapped, with out aid and being absolutely bombarded by air strikes.

Another thing that doesn‚Äôt sit too well with me either is the silence on this situation from the same people that were so vocal on social media the last 4 years around human rights on when it came to vaccines, face coverings and covid testing.

But, somehow there hasn‚Äôt been a peep out of them around the horrendous situation that‚Äôs going on in Palestine.ü§Ø

Why?ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It shouldn‚Äôt matter what your religion is, wether you‚Äôre from north, west, east or south this shouldn‚Äôt be about picking sides in this conflict.

We are witnessing genocide before our very eyes.

I am not anti-Semitic one bit nor do I condone the atrocities committed by hamas on oct 7th but as a human being I do not know how you couldn‚Äôt be vocal about the war crimes being committed by Israel right now and stand back and watch thousands of innocent men, women and children be slaughtered.

A whole population denied the most basic of human rights with no access to water, food, medicine, and other necessary supplies.

1200 children killed so far, to put that into context the average secondary school in UK has 986.

Imagine your child‚Äôs entire school completely wiped out, every year group, every teacher‚Ä¶

Obliterated.

Our children and grand children will learn about these things and as we have about atrocities committed through out history and ask us what we done‚Ä¶

What will we tell them?

Just hope some how this is resolved soon and peace can be restored before it‚Äôs too late.

Social media users have also been told to just go ahead and implicitly trust screenshots that carry the logo of a legitimate news outlet even if the headline reads ‚ÄòSwifties Infiltrate Hezbollah, Behead Leadership Before Screaming Taylor Swift Akbar‚Äô.

‚ÄúDo not, and we repeat do not accept that the seconds directly after an alleged attack/explosion/invasion/shooting might not be when a full accurate picture of events can be discerned.

You don‚Äôt need to be Muslim to stand for Palestine. You just need to be human..

14 Palestinians die every hour 1000+ in the last 10 days

Horrified by the loss of innocent lives, mostly children and women, in Gaza. My heart goes out to the victims' families. remember, hospitals and medical personnel are protected under international humanitarian law but Israel doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about single human lives, bc they are murders. 

Most if these lives are fucking kids?????? What‚Äôs wrong with this world we live at? Is this is the peace you guys want? 

This is not a ""war.""
A war implies equal footing, symmetrical power, armies instead of unarmed civilians as targets. 

This is a fucking genocide.

They might have been prepared to commit genocide. But they were extremely underprepared for the truth finding ability of social media. The way they've been spreading false information has been so sloppy. Thankfully; Truth comes out.

Humanity does not say yes to these acts, nor does any religion. If you don't see this as a problem, then you are the problem. I have a voice, that's why I'm speaking up so should you.

Praying for my Palestinian brothers and sisters. Praying that Palestine will be free one day Don't stop speaking loud! 

‚Ä¢More Palestinian kids were killed in 1 Week
Than Ukrainian kids were killed in 1 Year. 
This is terrifying‚Ä¶..

This is not conflict. not war. genocide.
when one side of a ""conflict"" can control the other's water, food, electricity, and internet supply when one side receives over $3 billion in military funding from the US every year-and when the other side is forced to evacuate with absolutely nowhere to go - that is not ¬´conflict."" that is extermination.

THEY GOT MONEY FOR WARS BUT CANT FEED THE POOR..

instagram,"‚ö†Ô∏èüáæüá™BREAKING: A US Navy warship operating in the Middle East intercepted multiple projectiles near the coast of Yemen.

One of the officials said the missiles were fired by Iranian-backed Houthi militants, who are engaged in an ongoing conflict in Yemen. 

Approximately 2-3 missiles were intercepted, according to the second official.

The officials said it was unclear what the missiles were targeting. It‚Äôs possible the missiles were fired at the USS Carney or launched towards another target.

The incident comes amid high concern about potential Iranian aggression as tensions in the Middle East continue to rise following the Hamas terror attack in Israel. Iran has long been a backer of Hamas.

The USS Carney transited through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea on Wednesday. US Fleet Forces command said in a social media post that it would ‚Äúhelp ensure maritime security and stability in the Middle East.‚Äù",,413,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 413, 'num_users': 479026}",OAF Nation,,2023-10-19 18:46:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/138550071_239186291028601_7716634369521799910_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Zh7yFgSc6cIAX9rCrvV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAqtyc4qXNAMdDcjgFkc2zwwj1GeSY-8i2kBI2y-IHVUg&oe=655A4AD1,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyl0iJxvYpt/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393590947_3583119548573875_7748014266725718798_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EHjVWA3iGKsAX-gdaEJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAv2pDG0Ovg0zWlDSKaG2gNSQCrVy-XaZa1ZHft0dLNXg&oe=65440A19
instagram,"Representatives of Belgium's three largest religious communities, Judaism, Islam and the Catholic Church, read a joint appeal for peace and unity in Parliament on Thursday afternoon. They particularly warned against importing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into the country.

The chief rabbi of the Antwerp Jewish community Pinchas Padwa, imam Nordine Taouil and priest Rik Hoet met at the invitation of N-VA MP Michael Freilich. The meeting took place half an hour before the opening of the plenary session of the Chamber, in a room at the Palais de la Nation. 

In their letter, the three major religious communities warn of the consequences of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on our society. ‚Äú Let us not import conflicts from elsewhere and let us not allow our lives to be guided by extreme ideas and positions. In this country, we are all fellow citizens, neighbors, friends and/or business partners,‚Äù they said . -they notably declared. ‚Äú It is easy to hide when things are difficult and it hurts us when innocent people die, but we must defend peace and fight against hate speech. Belgium is our country and we need each other. ‚Äù , added Nordine Taouil. 

The Secular Action Center questioned this initiative which gives "" the false impression that the Federal Parliament would open its doors to a selection of religious convictions "", it indicated in a reaction to Belga. ‚Äú Fortunately, that‚Äôs not the case. ‚Äù

"" After the attacks of 2016 which bloodied our country, in a joint declaration, the federal government, recognized religions and secularism, affirmed their desire to 'defend and promote our common base of values' by indicating that these are 'those of the Enlightenment like fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom of conscience, separation of Church and State, equality between men and women, - discrimination' "", recalls the CAL.",,407,"{'like_count': 405, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 13354}",muslimjewishbrotherhood,,2023-10-19 17:00:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/384983331_1060310614974054_1458891557923464658_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SRPyzfV-N-wAX-a9Bik&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAizNgD51xG3CpznHruOY1zeBbxiz5dGNhPvmd8z9r7tw&oe=655B1481,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyloZxoPmy8/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393286781_867037527960197_8019824180840001296_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0Nv-1YXG0-EAX-h11NE&_nc_oc=AQnUhy06l1T1DjwLIW34UtIUOhd7p_m2MLUXAYm-9ZKOszl1w9scws3CZD7n41CFLIA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCBn8-CFp0iKIrCGYEPDx4TdUmYOSKngM0g_nnU_N6-4A&oe=653AF249
instagram,"PART ONE OF TWO

In an effort to get a gauge on what the community (you) is feeling, we asked for your judgements on whether or not the Israel - Palestine conflict will escalate into a wider regional conflict. In this post - we will provide why you think it WON'T escalate:

-
The possibility of the current Israel-Palestine flare-up evolving into a wider Middle Eastern conflict is moderate, but historically, those conflagrations haven't cascaded into bigger Middle East wars.
-
Countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may be more willing today to work with Israel against Iran and may have minimal public reaction to the latest bout of fighting, but the new geopolitical order in the region hasn't had to weather a conflict involving Israel and the Palestinians, for whom most Arabs retain sympathy.

The war‚Äôs progress seems unlikely to spread into a broader conflict, and Hezbollah‚Äôs supportive IDF and rockets as a signal of solidarity rather than shaping operations. They don‚Äôt seem likely to commit more forces, especially if rallies keep happening in Beirut rather than in the South. Lebanon also can‚Äôt afford a repeat of 2006 costs. 
-

-
Syria seems unlikely to open another front. No internal assessment can possibly encourage Assad to commit to another conflict. Al-Sisi has an election and economic crisis to handle. Though warfaring is probably his comfort zone, he‚Äôs showing great concerns for the refugees likely destined for the Sinai, and Islamic State‚Äôs efforts.
-
Jordan has a Palestinian queen and a Palestinian refugee problem-cum-source of radicalisation. Neutrality is key for King Abdullah II.
-

Jordan and Egypt are helping Israel, and nobody is coming in from Jordan or Egypt. Syria has too much going on, and Lebanon is a failed state. Nothing kinetic is happening outside of the localized conflict.

//

So what do you think of the above judgements? Credible? Cooked? Let us know in the comments below!

Look out for part two which will be why some of you think it WILL escalate.

instagram,"This week in the State Senate, a resolution passed regarding the conflict in Palestine and Israel. 

Just like some other non-binding resolutions we work on in the legislature, it passed as a voice vote with no recorded voting. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean that the resolution as written represents the views of every member of the Senate. 

While I wholeheartedly condemn the killing of innocent civilians by Hamas and join my fellow Americans in a call for peace, this resolution failed to dignify the humanity of all innocent people suffering due to the conflict.

If the Michigan State Senate is going to weigh in on an international conflict over which we have little control, we at least need to acknowledge the full context and history surrounding the subjugation of the Palestinian people at the hands of the Israeli government. 

Palestine has been under a decades-long occupation, and Gaza has been called the world‚Äôs largest open-air prison by international human rights groups and Israeli activists alike. Thousands of innocent Palestinians were killed in the last two weeks and continue to fall victim to indiscriminate bombings in the world‚Äôs most densely populated area. 

Water, food, medical supplies, and electricity are human rights ‚Äì not commodities that can be turned on or off by an outside force at any moment. 

The collective punishment of the Gazan civilian population is a war crime and must stop immediately. Palestinians need increased humanitarian aid from the US and the world in order to simply survive. 

What has been clear in the aftermath of this tragic event is that the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, Arab-Americans, and Muslims in Michigan do not feel heard or listened to by our government leaders right now. Passing a resolution without materially acknowledging the plight of the Palestinian people and the needless death occurring daily in response to the attack only furthered that divide.

instagram,"‚ÄúIsrael has a right to defend itself.‚Äù It is a refrain frequently invoked to justify Israeli responses to attacks launched against its citizens by Palestinian militants. Yet not every Israeli has accepted that truism. Indeed, if there is a single individual who best represents the challenge to such thinking it is the late Yeshayahu Leibowitz.

A fierce embodiment of the Socratic gadfly, Leibowitz (1903-1994) was unafraid to use strong language to criticize Israel‚Äôs occupation of the Palestinian people and territories, which commenced in 1967.

‚ÄúThe corruption characteristic of every colonial regime would also prevail in the State of Israel,‚Äù he said in his typically provocative style. For Leibowitz, the occupation meant that Israel forfeited its right to retaliate in self-defense, and he was ever vocal about this position. For his opinions, he was called by no less an eminence than Sir Isaiah Berlin ‚Äúthe conscience of Israel.‚Äù Revisiting Leibowitz‚Äôs views now‚Äîmore than five decades after he first articulated them‚Äîprovides observers with a unique, and often overlooked, perspective in contemporary discourse on the conflict.

Yeshayahu Leibowitz was born in Riga, Latvia in 1903 into a family of religious Jews. They were Zionists, adherents of the pan-national movement founded in Europe whose goal was to establish a sovereign state for the Jewish people in their historical homeland, namely, the land of Israel. A brilliant pupil, Leibowitz studied chemistry and philosophy at the University of Berlin, and then medicine in Koln and Heidelberg, before moving to Basel to finish his medical degree while the Nazis rose to power in Germany. In 1934, he immigrated to Palestine and took an appointment as a professor of biochemistry, and later neurophysiology, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he taught for nearly six decades. In addition to publishing numerous books and articles on everything from the history of science to the philosophy of Maimonides, he was the editor of the Encyclopedia Hebraica, and a frequent public speaker on Jewish thought, ethics, and philosophy.

instagram,"My heart breaks for THE PEOPLE. The people who are just trying to live their lives, trying to care for the ones they love, trying to pursue their passions. I‚Äôve seen a lot of this world, and for all our differences (which should be celebrated not feared) most people are pretty similar, we just trying to get by. Trying to smile and laugh a bit more than we cry. Trying to do better for our seeds. 
Human suffering has always been here, but somehow the older I get, the more it resonates at my core. Maybe because I now know how fragile life is. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve met people all over this planet, some in regions that are now in conflict, who I desperately hope are safe. 
As an artist, I‚Äôve been lucky to meet and spent my time other artists, like minds, who speak that same ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô. I‚Äôve felt the stories we are all trying to convey. All in our own ways, but it‚Äôs all a familiar frequency. For all my cynicism, I actually believe in humanity, I do, but this world has a habit of traveling the dreary paths I expect it to repeatedly. I keep waiting to be surprised by real change and betterment. I‚Äôve seen a few glimmers here and there. I hope I get to see more. For now, hold the ones you love tight, help those in need when you can, talk to each other, and travel as much as you can. I truly feel there is a genuine fear by those in power of a well traveled person. The more one travels, the more one understands how connected we all truly are.
That‚Äôs all I got. I have no answers. It takes a long time to get to this point. To know you don‚Äôt know shit, and to accept that. 
My heart will always be with those in the struggle, regardless of where it is. 
Those who know me know of my distain for religion. I view it as any other opiate: If it helps you get by, cool, I understand. We all need something. However, when it‚Äôs abused it can destroy communities. Unfortunately this world is full of addicts. 
The old ways and constructs should have long been shattered. It‚Äôs time for an end to the oppression, the control, and to truly be liberated. 
Worldwide.
Comments will be off for this one because I‚Äôm not here to debate. I just needed to yell into this digital void.

instagram,"Is fighting fair in marriage really possible?

We think so. 

Fighting is never fun but there are a few practices that we believe can help the process to not be quite so damaging.

Here are a few tips on how to ‚Äúfight fair.‚Äù

‚û°Ô∏è If either of you is angry, take a time out to calm down.
‚û°Ô∏è During the time out, take time to pray before coming back together.
‚û°Ô∏è Listen to what your spouse is saying. Both of you should be able to speak without interruption.
‚û°Ô∏èRepeat back to them what you heard them say to make sure you heard them correctly. 
‚û°Ô∏è Do not raise your voice at one another. 
‚û°Ô∏è Empathize with each other: What does this look like from my spouse‚Äôs perspective?
‚û°Ô∏è Reframe your perspective to, the goal is not about you winning the argument, it is about your MARRIAGE winning. 

Start by simply putting one of these things into practice the next time you find yourself in an argument with your spouse and see how it shifts things.

If you find yourself having a lot of unhealthy conflict in your marriage and need help, comment or DM the words FIGHT FAIR for more information on our FREE webinar taking place October 24th at 12 pm central.",,366,"{'like_count': 355, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 62543}",Non-profit Christian Marriage Ministry,,2023-10-19 02:00:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/44880276_1880096505419104_2481226465442529280_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=TP5IljkMbRoAX_sAIl-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBOwMGEBT6WS2FTWh1RH7Z-9QmBFJlLUz7R9yOeeCIdFA&oe=655AF20A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CykBb5crXgN/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393983957_1053279825678708_25626717297300614_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=18YZrLEFd70AX8wT7IE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB6u6tHI4-zdsj2T9VS_De3zMFTTUQkESASVBjXa1wugA&oe=6559F0E3

A Nairobi trader has claimed that Nairobi county council officers, also known as Kanjos, robbed her of Ksh400,000 at Mwariro Market along Ring Road.

The lady, who sells potatoes in bulk, alleged that she lost all the cash she had made in sales and was counting huge losses after Kanjo raided her shop. 

Furthermore, the officers allegedly manhandled her, took the Ksh400,000 cash from her pocket, and nearly snatched her phone during the incident that happened on the evening of Wednesday, October 18. 

The woman attributed the raid to a misunderstanding between the county officials and the market management, adding that the traders ended up bearing the brunt. 

''There is a possible conflict between the county council officials and market directors that has caught traders in between,'' she alleged but did not divulge whether the directors reached out to the traders to clarify the issue. 

She also did not clarify if she had filed a report with the police in an effort to recover her Ksh400,000 cash. 

Nonetheless, the lady further complained that she is charged a Ksh 9,000-10,000 fee before she accesses the market, based on the capacity of potatoes she transports from the farm to her shop. 

Other than the frustrations by the kanjos, traders selling perishable goods complained of high cess fees imposed by the county government. 

They also urged the county, led by Governor Johnson Sakaja, to intervene and resolve the crisis by enacting better management structures and reducing taxes. 

Earlier on Wednesday, smokie and egg vendors at the Nairobi CBD counted losses after Nairobi Kanjos confiscated their trollies. The county council askaris alleged that the vendors were operating without licenses. 

Later on, Governor Sakaja condemned the act, apologised and compensated the vendors Ksh 10,000 each.",,366,"{'like_count': 363, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 123653}",Kenyans.co.ke,,2023-10-19 09:38:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/49548307_377885822966343_4416214128276799488_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=36JFBCCF5vIAX_rSLS5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAzXatPcKTHyIA2BSCgFo2aRVQMupKtjg0NOtJD6_7Iow&oe=655AB8D0,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyk1554qJ8H/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393579152_873019094193588_2725763367204247446_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=RJ9AQP50ePAAX_5yA9k&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAqpPt0ku6EyeyJPR-HFby3ZjBrglRbbU2_3Di2dIE3ow&oe=65374DFC

instagram,"Feeling disgusted by the world right now. Not just the terrorist attacks, carpet bombings, misinformation, private dm‚Äôs with lack of empathy for human beings and quite frankly basic racist reasoning, but also the silence across the board in my industry. I understand how people want to separate their careers with ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù.
I am also very careful not to get involved usually because you are opening the door to an endless spill of hate of the online comment section, internet racists and armchair bullies.
You have to go beyond religious beliefs and stand up for human decency and peace. 
I am horrified by the recent attacks by Hamas, anyone who isn‚Äôt is just f**** up, especially in our scene where we could have been the ones at the rave party, for example. However i am also disgusted by the israeli government carpet bombings and the suffering that Palestinian people are enduring throughout the ongoing Apartheid. I feel disgusted of how our governments aren‚Äôt calling for ceasefires and condemning the bombings. I understand how social media is pushing different information based on your political views, but this isn‚Äôt even a question of politics, it‚Äôs a question of humanity. So many Jews are speaking up like @jewishvoiceforpeace and standing up for peace doesn‚Äôt make you an Anti Semite. This has gone way beyond a Judaism vs Islam issue, it‚Äôs been hijacked by dangerous extremists on each side that don‚Äôt want a resolution. 
In this age of cancel culture, i understand how one should be very careful when using social media to express a personal view. I understand if you are scared of being cancelled or losing gigs. 
I will be taking a break from posting for a moment. I sincerely wish for this conflict to end and for both Israelis and Palestinians to finally live together in long lasting peace.

Whether advocating for this in leadership settings or gathering these groups weekly to enjoy each other's energy it's important to maintain a culture of belonging to promote excellence, especially in this context where it's easy to feel isolated from teammates you play the sport you love. 

An internal conflict many diverse student-athletes battle, there must be avenues for them to effortlessly reconnect to who they are and why they are here.""

‚ÄúLike many of you, I am heartbroken by the terrible violence and suffering in Israel and Gaza. The brutal attack by Hamas on Israel, the killing of so many innocent people‚Äîincluding children and the elderly‚Äîand the taking of hostages, fill me with grief and dismay. Israel's subsequent blockade and bombing of the Gaza Strip is causing the loss of yet more innocent lives. This tragedy has a long and complex history, one leading to an appalling result.

‚ÄúI know many members of our community have deep ties to Israel and to Palestine and are experiencing tremendous sorrow and trauma at this time. Your suffering must be particularly acute; we feel compassion for all that you are experiencing. 

‚ÄúWe realize that this conflict can engender powerful emotions and reactions among members of our community. We urge everyone to review and respect our essential Principles of Community, with particular emphasis on these two tenets:

‚Äú- We are committed to ensuring freedom of expression and dialogue that elicits the full spectrum of views held by our varied communities. 

‚Äú- We respect the differences as well as the commonalities that bring us together and call for civility and respect in our personal interactions.

instagram,"New Story By @maitre.pascal : People of the Middle Waters

The Osage Nation is an indigenous American tribe that formed around the Ohio Valley over two thousand years ago and migrated south after being hit by European diseases and frequent conflict with the Iroquois in the 17th and 18th centuries. 

In Oklahoma they purchased a reservation on the Kansas border, covering an area of roughly 5,900 square kilometres.

In 1894, vast oil reserves were discovered, by the 1920's bringing in $65,000 per head and a wave of extreme corruption with dozens of murders, only ended by congress disallowing non-native Osage from inheriting deeds to oil reserves. This infamous spate of killings is explored in Martin Scorsese‚Äôs new film.

Oil production peaked and now 90% of the Nation's budget comes from gambling. The Osage Nation is living in relative prosperity. Though most members are Catholics, they continue to honour ancestral traditions and original beliefs. 

1. Members of the Osage Nation take part in a commemoration ceremony for the anniversary Osage Nation recognition on 11 March 2006. 

2. An illuminated sign at the Osage Nation Visitors Center in Pawhuska.

3. Artist Wendy Ponca in her home with her children Sarah and Tom, her husband Antony and her adopted children Jade and Clovis. 

4. Bison grazing in the Tall Grass Prairie Reserve.

5. Everett Waller, Chairman of the Board of Mineral Resources including Petroleum standing in front of a mural featuring people from the Osage Nation.

6. A swimming pool at the Hotel Casino Osage. 97% of the Osage Nation's income comes from casinos. The Hotel Casino Osage is the biggest.

7. Commemoration ceremony for the anniversary Osage Nation recognition.

8. A man kneels and prays during Sunday Mass in a Catholic Church whose congregation comes from both the Native American Osage Nation and the local white American community.

9. An art work in Hominy City, home to many Native Americans from the Osage Nation.

instagram,"More often than not, it‚Äôs not big events that cause a relationship to break down. Instead, it‚Äôs a repeating cycle of negative reactions to perceived threats. These behaviors were once protective to us as children, but as adults, they‚Äôre damaging to our relationships.

These threats might look different for the different attachment styles: For those with an anxious attachment style, indications of disinterest, disengagement, or lack of physical affection may trigger fears of abandonment‚Äìso they fight against this threat by creating conflict, pushing for attention, or acting clingy to reduce their anxiety.

Those with an avoidant attachment style may perceive emotional closeness, attempts at intimacy, and having to open up as threats to their individuality‚Äìso they may flee from this threat and their feelings of anxiety by shutting down and withdrawing.

People with a disorganized attachment style often see emotional closeness as both desirable and fear-inducing‚Äìresulting in frequently swapping between both flighting for and fleeing from it. Their anxiety is difficult to manage because their attachment needs were consistently shifting as children, so they‚Äôve transitioned their anxiety-reducing behaviors to their adult relationships.

But by‚Ä¶
- Identifying the problem
- Questioning how your life would be different in you changed these behaviors
- Understanding the role of your attachment style in the cycle
- Working on communication skills, and
- Staying motivated
‚Ä¶it is possible to break the insecure relationship cycle!

-READ BELOW-

Ontario MPP Sarah Jama has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Premier Doug Ford over what she is calling ‚Äúdefamatory‚Äù remarks that accuse her of having a history of antisemitism.

The letter was sent to the Premier‚Äôs Office on Thursday, according to a lawyer representing Jama, and demands the premier retract the posts and publicly apologize within seven days.

On Oct. 11, Ford posted a statement on social media that called for the Hamilton-Centre MPP‚Äôs resignation.

He cited comments Jama made a day earlier about the Israel-Gaza conflict and said that she has a ‚Äúlong and well-documented history of antisemitism.‚Äù

The premier also said that Jama supported ‚Äúthe r*pe and murder of innocent Jewish people.‚Äù

The cease-and-desist letter says the public comments have done serious harm to Jama‚Äôs reputation.

Jama is about to be censured by the Progressive Conservative government over statements she made on social media that called for the end of ‚Äúall occupation of Palestinian land‚Äù as well as an end to the ‚Äúapartheid‚Äù in the region.

The statement did not originally mention the Hamas attack that occurred a few days prior, which resulted in thousands of deaths and the kidnapping of Israeli citizens.

The following day, Jama apologized and condemned the ‚Äúterrorism by Hamas‚Äù while also noting that she believes that ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs bombardment and siege on civilians in Gaza, as was also noted by the United Nations, is wrong.‚Äù

instagram,"The Texas Democratic Party and the Democratic Party of New Mexico joined forces to denounce the concertina wire installed along the Texas-New Mexico border as part of Gov. Greg Abbott's ongoing Operation Lone Star.

Coils of razor wire were recently installed along the Rio Grande near Sunland Park, New Mexico, which neighbors El Paso.

In a joint statement released Oct. 17, Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa and Democratic Party of New Mexico Chair Jessica Velasquez blasted Abbott's latest move as a ""stunt funded by the working Texas family's tax dollar that will result in environmental damage, community division and injuries of vulnerable migrants.""

""It's clear that Gov. Abbott has no plans on actually addressing our broken immigration system head on,"" Hinojosa and Velasquez wrote in the statement, ""but instead adding more fuel to Operation Lone Star's dumpster fire.""

The concertina wire strung along the Texas-New Mexico border is the latest in a string of efforts made by Abbott to stem border crossings by record numbers of asylum-seekers entering the U.S.

What began as razor-wire along the Rio Grande and morphed into a floating barricade in the middle of the river has now transformed into an interstate conflict.

instagram,"On Tuesday night an explosion at the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza killed an unknown number of people. From that moment two irreconcilable accounts of what caused the blast started to diverge.‚Å†
‚Å†
Whatever else happened it was a human tragedy and an object lesson in the power of misinformation to distort reality and influence real events:‚Å†
‚Å†
üî≥ Hamas quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike and said up to 471 people had died. ‚Å†
üî≥ Israel denied responsibility, blaming a misfired rocket launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. ‚Å†
üî≥ By that time a summit aimed at containing the war had been cancelled. Yesterday pro-Palestinian demonstrations filled city centres across the Middle East.‚Å†
üî≥ When two sides in a conflict trade blame and social media blurs the lines between citizen journalism and propaganda, how can independent researchers pick their way towards the truth? ‚Å†
‚Å†
It‚Äôs not impossible. Minute analysis of raw footage uploaded to social media ‚Äì in this case mainly Telegram ‚Äì can provide a basis for sorting fact from fiction.‚Å†
‚Å†
Yesterday researchers at Bellingcat, a pioneer of open source intelligence (Osint), were going frame-by-frame through more than 50 videos and images of the explosion and its aftermath.‚Å†
‚Å†
They were looking for clues to: The type of weapon that might have caused it; where it came from; where it landed; and its blast radius.‚Å†
‚Å†
They found plenty, but certain aspects of this new nadir in Israeli-Palestinian history were already clear.‚Å†
‚Å†
Both sides lie. Recent examples include Israel‚Äôs claim last year its soldiers didn‚Äôt kill the journalist Shireen Abu-Akleh ‚Äì disproved by open-source intelligence within days ‚Äì and a Hamas claim last week not to have targeted civilians on 7 October. But, with patience, the platforms that spread misinformation can be used to expose it too.‚Å†

instagram,"The OCHA reports that Israel's death toll is more than three times the total number of Israelis who lost their lives since the Office started recording casualties in 2005 (nearly 400).

Gaza/Jerusalem: The death toll in the ongoing Hamas-Israel conflict is nearing 5,000, with thousands of others injured and displaced as a result of the violence which continued for the 13th day on Thursday.

In its latest situation update, the UN Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA) said the death toll in Israel as of Thursday morning stood at 1,400, which included foreign nationals, as Palestinian armed groups‚Äô continued indiscriminate rocket firing towards Israeli population centres.

The number of injured increased to 4,562.

According to the OCHA, Israel‚Äôs death toll is over threefold the cumulative number of Israelis killed since the Office began recording casualties in 2005 (nearly 400).

Meawhile, at least 199 people are currently being held captive in Gaza, it added.

Citing the Palestinian Health Ministry based in Gaza, the OCHA said that the death toll in Gaza has increased to 3,478, including 853 children, with about 12,500 others injured.

The UN agency said the deadly bombing at Al Ahli Arab Baptist hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday left at least 471 people dead, including children, healthcare staff and Internally Displaced People (IDPs).

The overall death toll in Gaza in the last 12 days of hostilities has significantly surpassed the total number of fatalities during the 2014 escalation, which lasted for over 50 days, resulting in 2,251 Palestinian deaths, the OCHA said.

Meanwhile in the West Bank, 64 people have died since the conflict erupted on October 7, including 18 children. The number of injured persons stood at 1,284.

The cumulative number of IDPs in Gaza is estimated at about one million, including over 513,907 people staying in UN Relief Works Agency-designated emergency shelters , of whom 353,539 are in central and southern Gaza alone.

Since October 11, Gaza has been under a full electricity blackout, following Israel‚Äôs halt of its electricity and fuel supply, which in turn triggered the shutdown of the besieged enclave‚Äôs sole power plan",,310,"{'like_count': 305, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 53867}",Hyderabad News Insta,,2023-10-19 13:19:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/319075348_834526007636091_7251464161281060085_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=R4r92QhOFH8AX8ybzhW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBUWv5yaI--VZn078AXWvIXLy1ycFd4-VVPmaUaDLkuWQ&oe=655A8132,https://www.instagram.com/p/CylPKnfLXRm/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393175866_713474267318898_4108579582486710973_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qaDK9SDnZeQAX8DS_8w&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAFZlyShrqG9-ouOOHzca3E1ItZ-t85o9uuxTEiOO2V4Q&oe=6537F035

Grieving the loss of a loved one is a rite of passage in to this worldly experience. Unlike many rites ceremonies, this has no age limit. Some of us endure it early, others later.

I‚Äôll share that grief is not linear. We experience bouts at unexpected times, but if we remember why we are here ‚Äîwe stay grounded in our purpose. That grounding‚Äîthat rooting‚Äîwill sustain you on your journey. 

I stand United in grief with the human beings in our global family who are mourning loved ones who have lost their lives during this Millenia long Israeli/Palestine conflict ‚Äînow escalating to outright war‚Äîbut, in the same spirit of humanity, the greatest man who this land has ever produced once said; ‚ÄúInjustice anywhere, is a threat to just everywhere.‚Äù I say Free Palestine, not as a political choice, but as vote for the endurance of the best in us all‚Äîthe fact of our humanity, and subsequent inability to survive without each other.  #ceasefire

I don't want there to be any doubt about where I stand.

The decades-long genocide and occupation of Palestine must end.

It's always the right time to expand our knowledge through books. That's why most of us are here on bookstagram, right? Nonfiction November is coming up and I plan to start the month by reading Orientalism by Edward W. Said. In fact, I think I will probably start it a few weeks early.

Are you currently reading or planning to read anything to aid in your own understanding of this conflict or of the decolonization movement as a whole?

Last but not least, check out @haymarketbooks & @versobooks for their free ebooks on Palestine! And @librofm is offering up Minor Detail by Adania Shibli (an award-winning Palestinian novel about  war and memory) as a free audiobook this week. And for my UK-based friends, @fitzcarraldoeditions is also offering Minor Detail as a free ebook download.",,258,"{'like_count': 242, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 2719}",Sav | Book Reviews,,2023-10-19 15:49:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/311212681_112306344871666_6994297248679823200_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=VSnUMroujk8AX_ZA5Ad&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC8k36y1cDvE0v4j7ogUEJ44u6tWTDjlSZbjfF9RQkz1A&oe=6559DD3F,https://www.instagram.com/p/CylgSkpLrlQ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393173395_2159605750909789_6291348364426557210_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=vP8JQgTSYwUAX_NEmAz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCH87ejvNW1zHwFrTXJvCZCoPWSbMF0HvQJ8YTgZuqWuQ&oe=6546F0ED

instagram,"The First Day of Peace üïäÔ∏è 

A day so many all over long for. It hurts to even think about it. But for us to find peace we must sit with the discomfort, not be complacent and actively work towards justice whether it‚Äôs on a global scale or small acts in your community, in your friend circles. 

In this beautiful story, the mountain people and valley people live separately. When the extreme weather causes the river that runs through their town to dry out, the two must come together. They try and it ends in fighting. The winter comes and both parties are able to retrieve water and remain separate. The seasons change again this time bringing an over-abundance of rain with the warming temperatures. It floods the valley. Children of the mountain decide that they must do something to help their neighbors stuck in the floods. They bring them food, supplies and necessities. The valley people gratefully reciprocate with gifts. A new day, a new peace is born with two peoples who had only known how to fight with each other until that moment. 

This book shines light on disagreements between two groups of people, the valley and mountain peoples. I was blown away by the beautiful commentary on conflict and bigotry. It showed the children stepping up to break the cycles of othering, separation and hate that tends to get passed down.  This book challenges young people to look at conflict through a compassionate lens. 

This book was submitted as a contender for #bookstagang_bestof2023

instagram,"You may have realized that we‚Äôve taken a small pause on posting our regular business content this past week with the ongoing conflict happening in the Middle East. 

It is truly heartbreaking to witness such a catastrophic event unfold right before our very eyes and to feel helpless and guilty for living a normal and comfortable life whilst our brothers and sisters on the other side of the world are suffering. 

Many nations, businesses and brands are taking a neutral stance in regards to the ongoing atrocity and genocide happening in Gaza, not realizing that to be neutral is to be complacent. As Desmond Tutu said ‚ÄúIf you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor‚Äù

How can we be neutral when thousands of civilians, mostly children are being brutally killed everyday.

We refuse to remain neutral when an ethnic cleansing is happening to the Palestinian people. 

We refuse to be neutral when there is a genocide happening right before our eyes.

We stand with the Palestinian people and hope that they are granted ease.

instagram,"Reposted @yuval_noah_harari We must win this war of souls. In its war against Hamas, Israel has a duty to defend its territory and its citizens, but it must also defend its humanity. Our war is with Hamas, not with the Palestinian people. Palestinian civilians deserve to enjoy peace and prosperity in their homeland, and even in the midst of conflict their basic human rights should be recognized by all sides. This refers not only to Israel, but also to Egypt, which shares a border with the Gaza Strip, and which has partially sealed that border. Right now, the minds of both Israelis and Palestinians are filled to the brim with their own pain: no space is left to even acknowledge the pain of the other side. But outsiders who are not themselves immersed in pain should make an effort to empathize with all suffering humans, rather than lazily seeing only part of the terrible reality. It is the job of outsiders to help maintain a space for peace.

instagram,"Opinion | The Israel-Palestine conflict is the most recent reminder of how detrimental social media can be in times of true crisis.‚Å†
‚Å†
The recent conflict in Israel and Palestine has been one of enormous tragedy and loss for not only the innocent civilians in those areas but many around the world who have friends and family there. And, as has become the norm with fraught political issues of our time, social media has become the chief forum that hosts discourse about the subject.‚Å†
‚Å†
In theory, this is good. Ideally, the internet is a place where many have the opportunity to share their voices to people and places around the world where they otherwise couldn‚Äôt reach. This is still true and important. However, the most productive discourse will never happen in an online, virtual forum.‚Å†

instagram,"This isn't the actual quote of Catholic author and philosopher G.K. Chesterton. His actual words were: 

‚ÄúWe do not really want a religion that is right where we are right. What we want is a religion that is right where we are wrong.‚Äù¬†The Catholic Church and Conversion

First, a point of agreement. Both Protestants (for the most part) and Catholics believe in one God, one Lord Jesus Christ, one Holy Spirit, one faith (the Gospel), and one baptism. Jesus also built¬†one Church, not two, three, or three-thousand‚Äîone. Initially made up of the Apostles and their followers, this Church spread throughout the world. Due to the great distances, and to preserve the message of Christ, members of the Church wrote letters (epistles), accounts of Jesus‚Äô life (the Gospels), and the history of the early Church (Acts). In turn, these writings were copied and shared among the Church in different locations.

Almost immediately, the young Church had to address error. A group known as Judaizers, Jewish Christians who taught that Gentile converts to Christianity become Jews first (through circumcision) and follow the Mosaic Law, caused conflict even among¬†St. Peter and St. Paul. Eventually, the Council of Jerusalem settled the matter and¬†sent a letter¬†of explanation to the whole Church. Thus, the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, instituted an authoritative paradigm to address significant errors that pose significant threats to the unity of Christ‚Äôs one Church.

Moreover, the tendency to err did not cease with the Judaizers and the Council of Jerusalem. As the Church matured and its theology grew more complex, errors also emerged to divide Christ‚Äôs one Church.¬†Examples: Docetism¬†(1st¬†century),¬†Montanism,¬†Ebionites¬†(Adoptionism),¬†Valentinianism,¬†Sabellianism,¬†Marcionism,¬†Patripassianism¬†(2nd¬†century),¬†Novatianism¬†(3rd¬†century),¬†Arianism,¬†Donatism,¬†Monophysitism,¬†Apollinarism¬†(4th¬†century),¬†Nestorianism,¬†Pelagianism,¬†Eutychianism, (5th¬†century),¬†Iconoclasm, and¬†Monothelitism¬†(7th¬†century). 

Many of the errors (heresies) above required¬†ecumenical councils¬†as a means of correction. Jesus established one Church.

Renewed violent tensions triggered by Hamas earlier this month have left thousands dead.

Fidan, in his address during an emergency session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah Wednesday as reported by Anadolu Agency, said ‚Äúwhat unfolds in Gaza is a gross violation of any form of international law and any virtues that makes us human beings.""

He emphasised that Israel's actions dehumanise Palestinian people and normalise their suffering.

He condemned the Israeli airstrike on Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, which resulted in the tragic loss of at least 471 lives, according to Palestinian officials.

Fidan stressed the importance of preventing the conflict from spreading and called for immediate humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.

instagram,"As Israel and the Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas wage war, worries are building that the conflict will escalate to engulf the wider Middle East. Of particular concern is the role of Israeli foe Iran.

Iran provides money and weapons to Hamas, which the US and European Union have designated a terrorist group, as well as Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that regularly clashes with Israel. For years, Israel and Iran have engaged in a shadow war, quietly attacking each other on land, by air and at sea ‚Äî in Iran‚Äôs case sometimes by proxy.

They have mostly sought to avoid open clashes that would risk provoking all-out war, but that danger has grown. Tap the link in bio for more.

I love the way Jeffers renders images on the page and used colors. He captures something tender and joyful despite his often overwhelmingly large topics. BEGIN AGAIN is no different. Swipe to see some. This book has a long essay at the end that adds a lot to the illustrated portion. It helped me to see the heart of the book. It is vital to the book.

instagram,"#onthisdayinhistory Lord Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown on October 19, 1781. By the early 1780s, the United States gained greater assistance from foreign nations, especially France. With their assistance, American forces were able to launch successful attacks on British positions and gradually regain control of the US. By this stage of the American Revolution, most of the fighting was taking place in Virginia as many of the northern cities were recaptured by the Americans. 

The Siege of Yorktown used a combined arms tactic to force a British surrender.  By land, forces under the command of George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette advanced to meet the British positions in Yorktown, commanded by Lord Cornwallis. By sea, a French fleet under the command of the Comte de Grasse surrounded Yorktown and prevented a British retreat by sea. A siege began in late September 1781, and on October 19, the British surrendered. 

The capture of Lord Cornwallis forced the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict. As such, the Battle of Yorktown would be the last major engagement in the American Revolution. The United State‚Äôs independence would be guaranteed by September 1783 with the Treaty of Paris. #siegeofyorktown #usa #uk #france",,199,"{'like_count': 197, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 8727}",This Day In History,,2023-10-19 12:11:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/21042428_282793038867025_3538533081688309760_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=_LLeUnlxYTUAX_t8Dtk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC8fix9mACtO4-jjWKnwuNhQfcgcQWyFiWxcUKCA8AqDw&oe=655B602B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CylHUKFuEaQ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391355748_979614993107594_6690802604236328940_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JW-wxPo4uGkAX8l_aqb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAoreH7DHsZ0rlBH4Nhj3_TwcnGNYLPaLNaFLlp9jJ9rw&oe=654113AD

instagram,"Do you like it if anyone disrespects you? I know it‚Äôs an absurd question. Of course, you don‚Äôt. No one is immune to the effects of disrespect. Most of us find it hard to shake off incidents where we feel we were not respected enough. 

Never put up with disrespectful behavior. If you accept disrespect at the beginning of any relationship, you will find yourself forever struggling to fix that aspect. How two people or new family members treat each other in the first few weeks of meeting pretty much sets the tone of that relationship for the rest of their lives.¬†It means there came a moment in your life when you stopped loving yourself, that moment when you let someone disrespect you simply because they could. It means you accepted that moment. There is very little hope of now getting respect from this person.

If you are going to accept disrespectful behavior today, tomorrow, it‚Äôll get worse. Therefore, if you love yourself and want any sense of peace and equality in your personal relationships, make it clear in no uncertain terms the respect you seek. If someone is shouting at you today, at the next conflict, they are not going to lower their decibel. If anything, it‚Äôll be higher. Put a stop to it right at the beginning, no matter what the price. Otherwise, the pattern will become: conflict -> argument -> disrespect -> distance -> apology -> repeat. This pattern creates excess baggage. 

In personal relationships, remember the golden rule: whatever negative behavior you accept even once will only worsen over time.
Ultimately, the least everyone deserves is respect. And the paradox is that it can‚Äôt be granted as such, it has to be earned. If you deserve respect but don‚Äôt get it, you must take charge of your life. On the other hand, no matter how much you dislike someone, never deprive them of respect, even if out of politeness. For, respect is an acknowledgment of your existence. And, that is a big deal, one of the most fundamental human needs.

instagram,"De oorlog tussen Hamas en Isra√´l heeft in de afgelopen weken aan duizenden mensen het leven gekost. Drie decennia na de Oslo-akkoorden lijkt vrede, of een oplossing, verder weg dan ooit. Hoe heeft het zover kunnen komen en wat zijn de oorzaken van deze hevige strijd? 

We gaan in gesprek met kenners om erachter te komen welke geschiedenis eraan ten grondslag ligt. En daardoor wellicht beter te begrijpen wat er aan de hand is. Jelte Posthumus gaat in gesprek met journalist en Midden-Oosten kenner Jan Keulen en arabist en antropoloog Leo Kwarten.

Jan Keulen was correspondent in Beiroet, werkte later als journalist in Ca√Øro en Amman voor onder andere de Volkskrant, de VARA en de NOS, schreef veel over het Isra√´lisch-Palestijns conflict, was geregeld bezoeker van Gaza en was jarenlang betrokken bij Stichting Groningen - Jabalya. 

Leo Kwarten is opgeleid aan de Universiteit Leiden als arabist en antropoloog, is adviseur voor bedrijven die in het Midden-Oosten opereren en publiceert daarnaast veel over politiek en religie in de regio.

His challenge in winning Arab acquiescence to the Israeli offensive deepened after the Gaza hospital blast. The U.S. president sided with Israel, but Arab leaders believed Hamas-controlled Gaza authorities, who had already pointed the finger at Israel.

instagram,"‚ÄúWe live in a time where it‚Äôs almost impossible to know what is true anymore. Trust in government must be near an all-time low, and people have become wise to propaganda and power elite narratives.

That said, we can still move toward truth through discernment, synthesis and bringing a different level of consciousness to the table. But we must slow down and widen our scope to do this.

As the conflict between Israel/Hamas/Palestine continues to increase, so do polarization and emotions. Part of this is based on the feeling of sadness and grief of witnessing horrific events, and part of it emerges from propaganda and social engineering designed to create black and white narratives around complex situations.

You may be reading this wondering what side I am on and who I think the bad guys are. My perspective has always been that understanding the core of why our world is the way it is as this is the only place we find true change. When we become holistic and curious enough to more accurately define a problem, we have a chance at a solution.

Sensemaking these ongoing events has been very challenging. Facts are changing by the minute and there is literally no reason to believe in full faith the propaganda coming from The US, Israel or Hamas on this issue.‚Äù

Cel mai devreme, ajutorul umanitar va intra √Æn Gaza vineri, potrivit The Times of Israel.

CNN aratƒÉ cƒÉ F√¢»ôia Gaza »ôi Cisiordania vor primi 100 de milioane de dolari ca ajutor umanitar de la SUA, bani care vor proveni din finan»õare pre-aprobatƒÉ.

‚ÄûAce»ôti bani vor sprijini mai mult de un milion de palestinieni afecta»õi de conflict, inclusiv nevoile de urgen»õƒÉ din Gaza‚Äù, a declarat pre»ôedintele Joe Biden la Tel Aviv.

Israelul a fost de acord cƒÉ ajutorul umanitar poate trece din Egipt √Æn Gaza. √énsƒÉ, premierul israelian Benjamin Netanyahu a spus cƒÉ Israelul nu va permite aprovizionarea de pe propriul teritoriu p√¢nƒÉ c√¢nd Hamas nu va elibera to»õi ostaticii.

2Ô∏è‚É£ DupƒÉ ce armata israelianƒÉ a dat dovezi cƒÉ Jihadul Islamic este responsabil pentru explozia de mar»õi searƒÉ de la spitalul din Gaza, guvernul SUA a declarat cƒÉ nu Israelul este responsabil pentru asta.

√énsƒÉ, lumea arabƒÉ este scepticƒÉ cu privire la acest lucru.

The Guardian √Æl citeazƒÉ pe ministrul de Externe al Iordaniei, Ayman Safadi, care spune cƒÉ ‚Äû√Æn Orientul Mijlociu existƒÉ un scepticism profund √Æn ceea ce prive≈üte evaluarea Israelului ≈üi a SUA cu privire la explozia de la spitalul din Gaza‚Äù.

The New York Times scrie despre protestele de amploare izbucnite √Æn Liban, Iordania, Turcia, Iran sau Cisiordania. Lumea arabƒÉ s-a solidarizat cu palestinienii dupƒÉ ce 471 de oameni au murit √Æn explozia de la spitalul din Gaza.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Prima ≈üedin≈£ƒÉ comunƒÉ a Guvernelor Rom√¢niei ≈üi Ucrainei, care a avut loc miercuri la Kiev, a dat roade.

Premierul Marcel Ciolacu a anun»õat cƒÉ limba oficialƒÉ pentru minoritatea rom√¢nƒÉ din Ucraina este √Æncep√¢nd de joi limba rom√¢nƒÉ, nu ‚Äûlimba moldoveneascƒÉ‚Äù, scrie News.ro.

Self-knowledge is true knowledge‚Äîall other knowledge changes. What we learn in school differs based on the period of time. Our school knowledge is not based on what's good for us but rather on the best way to govern and control others.

That's why some communities send their children to two schools‚Äîone to learn about others, the other to learn about themselves. So, with all that we think we know, such as the name of the first president, sadly, we don't know who we are. We've spent years believing in the intellect and not the spirit. As a result, we stay child-like, superficially smart, and uninvolved instead of wise and evolved.

With self-knowledge, we become empowered with thoughts that transcend this world. We seek that ultimate truth. But to seek that truth, we must realize the conflict within ourselves.

That conflict is to either remain asleep or wake up. Better yet, as the story goes, we can be like ""Iai,"" an ass that won't let go of the lies or falsehood. Undoubtedly, we've become stubborn in thinking that the path is one of assimilation with a dominant force, whereas it's one of assimilating with a life force. No one will empower you with self-knowledge, which leads us to the ""ultimate"" truth. Give yourself the gift of waking up to truly being free. -Dr. Robbin Alston

instagram,"The events of the past weeks in the Israel-Palestinian conflict are beyond our imagination and have left us in shock. We have been lost for words after the horrific attacks on the 7th of October and the bloodshed of so many innocent men, women and children in the Gaza strip. The devastating strikes on the Al Ahli Arab hospital this week and on UN shelters and schools left us shattered. At least 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes according to the UN organizations.

Our thoughts and hearts are with all the people who mourn and worry for their relatives and the lives lost in the violence that is taking place.

Aggression against civilians will never be a pathway to peace and freedom and we condemn every form of it. At the same time International humanitarian laws are the corner stone of society and should be obeyed without any impunity and at all times by every nation. 
 
We call on the global leadership to take responsibility and prevent further escalation, not only for the region but for humanity on a global scale. We should learn from history not repeat it‚Ä¶

Our Junior RE students were asked to reflect on the current conflict overseas and to think about how to be people of peace.  They wrote these hopes and prayers for peace down and then these messages were joined together and used to create a prayer chain. The prayer chain was placed in our rose garden, providing a space for our staff and students to reflect and pray. We thank Mrs Thornely and Miss Ambrose for facilitating this beautiful activity for our students. 
 
As a community, let us pray ü§ç
 
Creator of the heavens and the earth, 
We come to you seeking peace in the world. 
In the wake of horrific acts of violence, we ask for your comfort and healing
touch for those affected and for our families and friends near and far.
May your consuming love permeate communities everywhere. 
Hear our cry for mercy and peace.
Amen.

Although El Ghazi clarified his call for peace and empathy on Twitter, his original message, now deleted, led to his suspension from training and matchday activities.

The phrase ""from the river to the sea"" in the post is contentious in Germany, potentially leading to criminal prosecution as it's seen as inciting the destruction of Israel. Mainz stated that El Ghazi's post doesn't align with the club's values.

""The last video call was three days ago, since then I haven't heard from them because there is no more electricity. Their mobile phones are flat and they can't charge them. In the last conversation with my mother she said that there are simply no safe places in Gaza. So they stay at home, hoping that a bomb won't fall on their heads.""

In his opening remarks at the first Canada/CARICOM Summit in Ottawa yesterday, Trudeau cited the conflict in the Middle East as an example of ‚Äúthe great turbulence‚Äù in the world, and the challenge which it could pose to countries such as Canada and those in CARICOM.

He said it was therefore important to tighten the long-established bond between the two regions.

instagram,"It was an incredible honor to have been invited to the Republican Women‚Äôs annual Gala honoring the Wyoming Army National Guard. 
Not only was I coined by U.S. Senator John Barasso, but I had the opportunity of being a guest speaker! 

What made this night so special was having the chance to share my life‚Äôs story before a large audience including my dad who attended the appearance with me‚Ä¶ AND who was also recognized by Senator Barasso for working hard as the Mayor of the City of Sheridan, Wyoming! 

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about from opportunities like this, it‚Äôs that there IS room at the table for different + unique! While some of the other honored speakers spoke to matters of hardship and war conflict, I spoke about Army + pageantry + music. At first, I was extremely intimidated thinking my story was too fluffy or that it simply didn‚Äôt measure up or belonged in that space‚Ä¶but to my surprise it really did. There‚Äôs room for you + your story! 

A sincere thanks to everyone who made this possible, I am extremely grateful to be a representative of the state of Wyoming and to women around the world. It was a privilege to sit among Senator Barasso and SFC Smith who is shown in one of my photos along with his beautiful daughters‚Ä¶who loved the crown + sash ü§© may all their dreams come to life! 

A lot of exciting opportunities unfolding this season ‚Äî stay tune!

instagram,"5 Ways to Get a Conflict Conversation Back on Track

Agree: Find something your partner has said that you can agree with. Start your sentence with ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù, ‚ÄúI partially agree‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI agree and‚Äù.

Reinforce Team: Highlight that you are on the same team and it‚Äôs you two against the problem.

Take a  Break: Indicate you are too overwhelmed to continue and that you need a break to collect your thoughts.

Take Responsibility: Be accountable for the role you played in creating the problem.

Compromise: Find a solution that is not 100% of what either of you want, but honors most of both of your needs.

instagram,"Our hearts break as we witness the crisis unfolding in Gaza and the surrounding areas. As a humanitarian organization, we are guided by the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence to deliver assistance to those most in need. Alight responds to emergencies where we are best positioned to provide immediate support and over the last 12 days, we have been continuously assessing the situation to determine how we may serve the communities impacted by the conflict. 

Within the last 24 hours, the humanitarian corridor into Gaza opened. This provides a critical avenue for aid into Gaza in order to deliver essential resources like water, food, and medicine. @un_ocha has reported that the total number of internally displaced people in Gaza is currently estimated at about one million. 

We are raising emergency funding on behalf of Alight's affiliate, @Questscope, and an alliance of trusted, local organizations who are providing humanitarian relief in the region. The alliance has already provided over 2,000 food baskets, set-up community street kitchens, and distributed fuel to hospitals in the southern region of Gaza. But they are in desperate need of more funding. 

We ask that you hold space for compassion and care for the countless lives that have been lost and affected in recent weeks and if possible, please consider making a donation. Link in bio.

Those who seek justice by revenge, don‚Äôt realize that nothing they will ever do, would be greater than the karma and lessons that God will teach that person in due time. If you don‚Äôt believe this, then you don‚Äôt have full faith in the power of God on the laws of this universe. Anything other than this is messing with God‚Äòs plan and timing‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs messing with the possibility of this world to fully live in peace one day. 

Revenge. Killing another human being. Hatred and division has never been the answer‚Ä¶ And it never will be.

The relief assistance, carrying one thousand winter tents, four thousand blankets, and three tonnes of medicines, will reach Palestine via Egypt in a chartered aircraft, the Foreign Office said in a statement.

Israel's unabated airstrikes on Gaza have claimed nearly 3,500 lives while thousands of others are injured. Entire city blocks have been levelled, water, food, and power have been cut off, and over one million people have been displaced.

Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel has claimed more than 1,400 lives ‚Äî and the conflict has set off a wave of fury across the Middle East against Israel and its Western allies.

At the media briefing today, FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan remains deeply concerned about the situation of ""our Palestinian brothers and sisters"" in Gaza.

instagram,"No sooner did the nation get over the tragedy of heroic martyrdom of Commanding Officer 19 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) alongwith one of his company commanders, and a Jammu and Kashmir Police officer than we got the shocking news of a terrible incident of fratricide in 48 RR. In the latest unfortunate incident, as per the media report, an officer opened fire at his colleagues and subordinates at a camp in Thanamandi in J&K‚Äôs Rajouri district. At least three to five personnel including two officers were injured. The Army as per the official report is investigating the matter that it has termed as ‚Äòin house‚Äô.

Rather than delving into particularities of the aforesaid actions, since it would be not in order, this piece endeavours to dig deeper into the general milieu of a RR unit comprising the in-expendable human resources that it possesses. Vis-a-vis the low intensity conflict that the Indian Army has been fighting in Jammu and Kashmir, RR units have always remained in the forefront. These outstanding units have been in the news mostly because of the valour and sacrifice of its troops, led by their leaders.

instagram,"üü† Wednesday was #nationalunityday and #NUFSD is U-Knighted against bullying! Black and Gold made way for orange at A. MacArthur Barr yesterday as several students, faculty, staff and administration members arrived wearing brightly colored shirts, pants and headbands to send a visible message that ‚Äúno child should ever experience bullying.‚Äù

October is recognized across the country as #NationalBullyingAwarenessMonth and ‚ÄòUnity Day‚Äô was created by @pacer_nbpc to ‚Äúunite for kindness, acceptance, and inclusion.‚Äù A perfect fit for #NUFSD, which has been developing MTSS (multi-tiered support systems) to maximize student achievement and support students social, emotional, and behavior needs from a strengths-based perspective.

‚ÄúThe middle school has been working on helping students develop an understanding of what it means to be part of a community, and how their words and actions impact the community.,‚Äù says Barr Principal Michelle O‚ÄôSullivan. ‚ÄúNational Unity Day focuses on promoting inclusion and kindness, so our SEL and Mental Health Committees worked together to plan age appropriate lessons and activities deigned to raise awareness and help call students to action!""

Students spent their homeroom periods discussing the difference between conflict, mean moments and bullying and the importance of knowing the difference between these situations. 

‚ÄúWe want them to recognize that acceptance and inclusion does not mean you have to be friends with everyone, but we can be friendly to everyone,‚Äú says School Psychologist Maryclare Farrington.

Students in the Better Together Club designed kindness posters with assistance from club leaders as well as Principal O‚ÄôSullivan and @clarkstownpd SRO Culianos. In addition to the posters, several other anti bullying messages will appear throughout the school. Outside the main office is a tree adorned with orange leaves that features positive sayings crafted by our sixth graders.

‚Äî-
Women require a variety of safe spaces, that allow them to be themselves thoroughly authentic.
Women led organization's often separate discussions about self-love and professional growth, which doesn't encourage a wholesome & balanced life experience. Within us exist different facets of self, that should co-exist effectively. Furthermore, we must come to the realization, that the empowerment of women, cannot be effective unless we include men in the conversation. We must find ways to steer one another, in order to build a society of empowered women, living alongside healed & empowered men.
There still exist a number of issues that cause ""pull her down"" syndrome within female spaces, formed through insecurities and lack of engagement that encourages women, to look deeply within themselves in all facets of their beings. Therefore, women were in need of homes and spaces outside of what they already intimately have... bigger spaces for greater engagement and impact.

‚ùáÔ∏è In my latest article, I share my thoughts on what it means to be a woman. Here are some of the key ideas from this lengthy reading üìñ, which celebrates the incredible strength, resilience, and empowerment that accompany womanhood. üíÉüèª‚ú®

‚ùáÔ∏èIn a world where gender matters less than personal choice and identity, it's time to break free from traditional expectations and embrace the true essence of being a woman. 

‚ùáÔ∏èMy belief is that in a society where everyone's unique strengths, regardless of gender, are celebrated and leveraged to the fullest, true equality will be realized.

‚ùáÔ∏èAnd it's not just about equality. It's about embracing our unique blend of strength and femininity. Balancing roles as mothers, wives, and managers requires superhuman strength üå∫üí™üèº

‚ùáÔ∏èIn her book ""Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men"" by Caroline Criado Perez, she highlights that our world is primarily designed for men, often overlooking women's needs in design considerations.
Have you ever wondered why we often wait longer in restroom lines? This fact-driven analysis truly fascinated me. 

‚ùáÔ∏èAbout the power of female representation in leadership. It's not just about gender equality; it's about creating a more harmonious and cooperative world, where empathy and conflict resolution thrive. üåç

instagram,"There is no objective standpoint through which this conflict could be narrated. Each narration has to either accept or reject the Orientalist representations of the Oriental, erect or dismantle the temporal wall, and expand or contract its definition of violence. Once the Orientalist representation is accepted, the Israeli temporal wall perpetuated and the definition of violence reduced to the brute force of arms, the Palestinian loses their humanity.

instagram,"Sold: All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque - First Edition, First Printing June 1929. This is a hauntingly vivid portrayal of the brutal realities of war, specifically World War I. Through the eyes of the protagonist, Paul B√§umer, readers are thrust into the grim trenches and witness the physical and psychological toll that combat exacts on soldiers. Remarque's prose is raw and unflinching, offering an unvarnished look at the futility and senselessness of conflict. It's a poignant reminder of the human cost of war, prompting deep reflection on the value of life and the tragedy of young men sent to battle. This novel stands as a powerful testament to the enduring impact of war literature, urging us to remember the sacrifices and question the forces that lead nations into such devastating conflicts.

instagram,"A physical w/\r is also a psychological one. There are m@nipulat!on tact!cs, carefully curated campaigns, strategic wording, talking points designed to shift public perception.

The machinery of ‚ö™Ô∏è supr‚Ç¨m@cy, s‚Ç¨ttl‚Ç¨r c‚≠ïÔ∏èl‚≠ïÔ∏ènial!sm, ü™ßmper!al!sm, and m!l!tar!sm are very well oiled.

To apply critical thinking, we need to zoom out and look at the history, power, and ide0l0gies at play. We need frameworks to help us orient ourselves toward what is just, what is inequitable, and what we‚Äôre willing to support.

AbüòØlit!on taught me to look at the conditions that create individual behaviors. It taught me to question inhumanity not from an individualistic perspective but a system!c view.

P/\l‚Ç¨st!n!an artists, poets, musicians, journalists, organizers, and fr‚Ç¨‚Ç¨d0m f!ght‚Ç¨rs have been documenting their 75-year struggles of r‚Ç¨sist@nce, land pr0tect!on, and movement work.

It should all be at the top of our priorities, as people living in a s‚Ç¨ttl‚Ç¨r c0l0n!al project fund!ng these atrocities, to look through this documentation and apply logic, reason, and emotion to what we see. This way, we can be in active dialogue with these structures at play. Otherwise, we‚Äôre ‚ôüÔ∏èpawns in a game. I firmly believe this is a responsibility we have, especially for anyone who believes in the practices of just!c‚Ç¨. I firmly believe it is wrong to play Battlefield with people‚Äôs lives, like these leaders are doing.

I keep seeing this on my feed: ‚Äúthese are children, look at these children.‚Äù Don‚Äôt just look at their d‚Ç¨/\ths, look at the lives they‚Äôve been living. Look at their conditions. I pray on everything good within us that we f!ght for a future that addresses this v!0l‚Ç¨nce at its roots. Look at what‚Äôs at stake.

instagram,"The situation between Palestine/Israel is absolutely catastrophic and soul-crushing, beyond words! Most of all, seeing the images of precious, innocent children being killed or orphaned in masses brings so much pain, sadness, grief, and anger! I see my own children in their eyes and faces. It‚Äôs heartbreaking!!
-
The fact that grown adults that are filled with so much prejudice and hatred feel it is ok to sacrifice precious, innocent children in their conflict is so deeply troubling and horrifying, and will no doubt traumatize an entire generation.
-
One of my favorite quotes from the Universal House of Justice states, ‚ÄúChildren are the most precious treasure a community can possess, for in them are the promise and guarantee of the future. They bear the seeds of the character of future society which is largely shaped by what the adults constituting the community do or fail to do with respect to children. They are a trust no community can neglect with impunity.‚Äù
-
The terrorism and retaliatory genocide occurring at this moment is so morally wrong! The history and context in any situation, is of course important, but children being treated like this is NEVER, EVER justified and will only lead to more conflict, more pain, more war, and more injustice!
-
I have been praying that God helps those involved to see the futility of violence as a tool to bring progress or peace. I have also spent time learning about the situation to better understand what can lead to this type of destruction, as well as discussed the matter with family and friends to understand various perspectives.
-
While many on social media have used their platform for good, to advocate for peace, justice, and freedom, I have also been saddened by the level of conflict and contention that has arisen among the masses of humanity on this matter. Conflict cannot bring peace, only unity can.
-
I pray that a cease-fire may come very soon, and that the hearts of the righteous may prevail over those that are bloodthirsty. Peace over war! Justice over prejudice and oppression! Love over hate! Unity over division! Humanity over brutality!

instagram,"To go to Israel, or not to go? And for what purpose? Emmanuel Macron has been weighing up the options and assessing the risks and rewards. 

The French president has been hesitating and getting ready at the same time, as Israel prepares to launch a ground offensive in Gaza. 

On the sidelines of his official visit to Albania on Tuesday, October 17, Macron conceded that he might visit the Jewish state ""in the next few days"" or ""in the next few weeks."" ""My desire is to be able to travel [to Israel] when we can obtain a concrete agreement either on non-escalation, or on humanitarian issues and, more broadly, on everything,"" he said from Tirana.

A visit to Israel by Macron has been under consideration since the Hamas terrorist attacks on the Jewish state on October 7. But the possibility of such a presidential trip gained momentum on Monday, when it became apparent that first German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and subsequently US President Joe Biden, were preparing to visit the region, on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Since then, the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, announced on Wednesday evening that he too would be visiting the region on Thursday.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's invitation for France to attend a conference on the future of the Palestinian cause on Saturday could have encouraged Macron to visit the Middle East, and thereby assert France's position ‚Äì which is somewhere between support for Israel against terrorism and concern for the Palestinian cause. But the Elys√©e Palace has been concerned that the summit would produce a communiqu√© condemning Israel.

Over recent days the Israeli government has tightened the blockade so that even commodities essential for survival are denied to the civilian population. Researchers on the protection of children in Gaza are receiving messages from families that they are surviving on bread and contaminated water.

The world is learning, almost in real time, about the impact on the children of Gaza of the latest siege-like conditions imposed by Israel in the wake of Hamas‚Äô attacks. The lack of water and food is inevitably affecting the young more immediately and more severely than adults.

instagram,"Tweens have crushes, they fantasize, and they get aroused. Pretending these feelings don‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt exist is counterproductive. The conflict is in accepting this biological fact alongside a parental need to protect kids from being exposed to adult experiences for which they aren‚Äôt emotionally or physically prepared.
To effectively do this requires a deep examination of your fears. By asking yourself, ‚ÄúWhat am I most afraid of?‚Äù you can zero in on how to give your young adolescent advice and limits specific to your concern and not just issue blanket statements of disapproval.

instagram,"‚ÄúWASHINGTON, D.C. ‚Äì Oregon‚Äôs U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, joined by U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), today urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reject a proposal from TC Energy for a major expansion of methane gas infrastructure in the Pacific Northwest, as FERC is scheduled to take up the proposal at a Thursday meeting. The Senators pointed to a myriad of problems with TC Energy‚Äôs proposal and FERC‚Äôs consideration process, including the proposal‚Äôs direct conflict with Washington, Oregon, and California climate laws; a potential rise in energy costs for consumers; TC Energy‚Äôs troubled safety record; and FERC‚Äôs failure to properly and sufficiently consult Tribes prior to a final decision. FERC is poised to make a decision despite the serious climate impacts of this project, which would undermine state climate laws and conflict with the Biden administration‚Äôs climate goals. FERC‚Äôs decision Thursday will prove to be a major litmus test on whether the Commission can pivot towards a clean energy future or whether it will continue to approve projects that are incompatible with avoiding the worst impacts of climate chaos. 

The Senators also raise concerns that FERC failed to properly consult with impacted Tribes, which is a trust obligation and raises questions about whether the proposal could impact tribal treaty rights. The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission was not consulted as part of the environmental review of the project, despite the fact that the pipeline travels near the Snake River and a safety incident could potentially impact endangered fish. ‚Äú",,114,"{'like_count': 114, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 8364}","Roberta Sam (Birdie, ShowMe_YourMask)",,2023-10-19 02:56:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/365852129_227829133567609_2417361925938813096_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=1quTJWU6tBMAX_-K7Cv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAVp7LMHiw0ox_B16Ir33dBD86P5JQ5pwcL1QiQzVBRMA&oe=6559FE50,https://www.instagram.com/p/CykH5zaLurJ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393010060_335435202476513_3921261095227767449_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=5mFRlXhThJIAX_BzG_H&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCe05jGNU2wqv38marHNDIPgkFlxVCCXmtKKobRNwhibg&oe=6541896C
