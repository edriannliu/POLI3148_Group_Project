(Bonus points if you can spot little Mwinzi, resting against a nearby tree, who was avidly watching the whole spectacle!) Manda was rescued in December 2021. Likely a victim of the dry season or human-wildlife conflict, Manda was very gaunt and had clearly been on his own for some time. After a determined dash to restrain him, the team then had to carry him through the bush to the waiting helicopter ‚Äî which is no small task, when the cargo is a 1,000-pound elephant. Manda will remain in our care for many years, until he is ready to reclaim his place in the wild. You can become part of his journey by adopting him today!

facebook,"PLAINFIELD TOWNSHIP HOMICIDE UPDATE On 10/14/2023 at approximately 11:38 AM, deputies with the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office were sent to a residence located near the 16200 block of S. Lincoln Highway in Unincorporated Plainfield Township regarding a stabbing that occurred involving a landlord and renter. When police personnel arrived on scene they located the suspect, Joseph M. Czuba (age 71) of Plainfield sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence. Joseph Czuba had a laceration to his forehead and was later transported to a local area hospital for treatment. Deputies located two victims inside the residence in a bedroom. Both victims had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso, and upper extremities. Both victims were transported to a local area hospital for treatment. The thirty-two (32) year-old female was transported in serious condition and had over a dozen stab wounds to her body. The female victim is recovering from her injuries at a local area hospital and is expected to survive this brutal attack. It was initially reported to police personnel that the juvenile victim was eight-years-old. That initial information was incorrect, and juvenile victim is six (6) years-old. The six-year-old male was transported to the hospital in critical condition. The boy later succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased by a doctor. On 10/15/2023, an autopsy was conducted on the six-year-old victim. The forensic pathologist conducting the autopsy removed the knife from the abdomen of the boy at that time. The six-year-old boy was stabbed twenty-six (26) times throughout his body. The knife used in this attack is a twelve-inch serrated military style knife that has a seven-inch blade. The suspect, Joseph M. Czuba, was treated and released from a local area hospital and was transported to the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office Public Safety Complex for questioning by detectives. Joseph Czuba did not make any statements to detectives regarding his involvement in this heinous attack. Despite the suspect not providing a statement to detectives, personnel were able to gather enough information through interviews and evidence to formally charge Joseph Czuba with numerous criminal offenses. Joseph Czuba was charged with First Degree Murder, Attempted First Degree Murder, Hate Crime (2 counts), and Aggravated Battery with a Deadly Weapon. Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis. The Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office would like to thank the Will County State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs Office for their assistance in working with detectives regarding Joseph Czuba being formally charged in this senseless and cowardly act of violence. Joseph Czuba was transported to the Will County Adult Detention Facility and is awaiting his initial court appearance.",,8278,"{'like_count': 107, 'comment_count': 1500, 'num_users': 40969}",Will County Sheriff's Office,,2023-10-15 18:51:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/240249803_223249359847456_5998685728836582372_n.jpg?stp=c1.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jb_rK8KQploAX9lHBDN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfATWer3CkWC5tlKXJCc9aqpDtG3-eFwqNlctJcXyXPFEw&oe=655A267D,https://www.facebook.com/100064871794683/posts/707625298076524,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393011090_707625271409860_8339030141166032365_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tpjAV2rJnaQAX9RJYF3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDCofKSdtKHFKM1moBXmjKZXOg5Ie2spuL-DH8Jhs699A&oe=65595EDA

facebook,"Fiji Airways Clarifies Israel Charter Operation Nadi, 16 October 2023 - Fiji Airways wishes to address certain concerns raised in the media regarding the operation of the recent charter flight to Israel. Fiji Airways would like to emphasise that the decision to operate the charter flight to Israel was based on purely commercial considerations. Following the recent delivery of two (2) new A350 aircraft into the Fiji Airways fleet, the airline has some excess wide-body aircraft time available, and operating charter flights is one way to utilise this excess aircraft time to generate additional revenue. Fiji Airways has an established business relationship with the charterer of the Israel charter flight, who has a history of operating successful international charters, and making timely payments for previous charter services. Whilst the terms of the charter agreement are confidential between Fiji Airways and the charterer, we can confirm that the charter is of commercial benefit to Fiji Airways. Fiji Airways would also like to clarify that at no point did any Government Minister or other Government official exert any undue influence or pressure on the airline to operate this charter. The decision was made independently by Fiji Airways. Fiji Airways does not operate on the basis of political or religious favoritism. We treat all of our customers and charterers equally, and the decision to operate this charter was solely a business decision. Fiji Airways is proud of its collaborative effort with the Government to safely repatriate our fellow Fijians from Israel. We would like to take this opportunity to publically acknowledge the Fiji Airways pilots and crew who operated this significant flight. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.",,2779,"{'like_count': 1145, 'comment_count': 263, 'num_users': 351861}",Fiji Airways,,2023-10-15 22:49:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352183662_176587215381077_1588140672965414996_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yaGzo0IvGisAX8jXzdl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD7F9JgG6vh1hbX8IgEIJacg9PIAAUxxLFUiV7WQdN-Kw&oe=655AD58B,https://www.facebook.com/100067517144126/posts/683283400598892,

facebook,"Palestina Ik probeer al een tijdje onder woorden te brengen hoe ik me voel over de gebeurtenissen in Palestina. Wetende dat zoveel mensen deze pagina volgen, probeer ik altijd zo goed mogelijk mijn verantwoordelijkheid te nemen om een gebeurtenis en harde realiteit juist en correct te bespreken. Tegelijkertijd vraag ik me af waarom ik de behoefte voel om iets op social media te plaatsen. Heeft het enige meerwaarde. Draag ik bij aan het aankaarten van iets, of is het eerder een onbewuste ego√Østische poging om me te ontdoen van mijn onmacht en woede die ik voel. Wat ik zeker niet wil, is dat het voor mij en jullie een angst wordt om er iets over te zeggen. Angst omdat het altijd duidelijk is geweest en alleen maar duidelijker wordt: steun voor onschuldige Palestijnse kinderen en families wordt te vaak gezien als een anti-Isra√´l boodschap. Waardoor we niets meer zeggen en we in alle stilte meekijken hoe een volk verdwijnt. Je zou denken dat het vreemd is, maar het zou je verbazen hoe we tot het punt zijn gekomen van angst. Angst om rechtvaardigheid en menselijkheid op te eisen voor een volk dat decennialang systematisch wordt onderdrukt, vermoord, weggedreven uit hun huizen en land. Een man in een moskee vertelde me eergisteren dat er met geen woord werd gerept over Palestina voor het gebed. Volgens hem heerst er een grote angst dat de deuren van de moskee door de overheid worden gesloten als er enige steun wordt uitgesproken naar het Palestijnse volk, opgevangen door inlichtingendiensten. Want daar zijn we beland: angstig om bezorgd te zijn om een volk, angst om het oneens te zijn met een politiek ten opzichte van een volk, angst om het woord ""Palestina"" uit te spreken alsof het je schuldig verklaart om tegen de burgers van Isra√´l te zijn. Alsof het onmogelijk is om empathie te hebben voor onschuldige Isra√´lische burgers en slachtoffers en ook kritisch te zijn ten opzichte van een politiek. Veel social media-platforms wissen accounts en berichten van steun aan de Palestijnen. Palestijnse vlaggen van burgers worden uit steden verwijderd. Sommige landen verbieden pro-Palestina manifestaties in hun steden. Het is zo ver gekomen dat steun voor een onschuldig Palestijns volk wordt gereduceerd tot het haten van het Isra√´lische volk. Het tegendeel is waar: het leven van onschuldige mensen heeft overal waarde. Maar tot mijn grote (niet verbazing) teleurstelling niet voor iedereen. En misschien niet voor de mensen die hier heel veel invloed op hebben of kunnen hebben. De politieke klasse. Vele media. En juist daarom raakt de reactie, buiten alle proportie, van een democratische regering en leger op een afschuwelijke aanslag miljoenen onschuldige Palestijnen en laat het velen, mezelf inclusief, achter met woede. Meer dan dat, we kijken allemaal naar onze regeringen die carte blanche geven om wraak te nemen op onschuldige mensen die al generaties lang onderdrukt, vermoord, weggejaagd van hun huizen en landen, en gestraft worden omdat ze gewoonweg bestaan en van hun bestaansrecht dromen. Ik kan op veel vlakken fout zijn, onwetend, verward of zoekend, maar niet over mijn gevoel dat dit fout is. Verkeerd. Oneerlijk. Als kind hebben we thuis de strijd van het Palestijnse volk al zo lang gevolgd als ik me kan herinneren. Onze ouders hebben, via de satelliet, beelden van het conflict en het lijden tientallen jaren lang naar binnen gebracht. Ik schreef mijn novelle ""Als je iemand verliest die je niet kan verliezen"" over een Palestijnse man die zijn familie is verloren, omdat ik het nooit hier hoorde of las. Ik las of hoorde nooit hoe het voelde voor hen in onze literaire boeken, films, tv-programma's, debatten of het nieuws. Ik las enkel een statistiek en dan de al te vaak gebruikte argumenten die beginnen met ""ja maar..."", alsof alles toelaatbaar was als het ging om hen. Ik ben niet iemand die advies geeft, maar ik sta mezelf toe er √©√©n te geven. Als je echt geeft om de situatie in Palestina en Isra√´l. Als je echt geraakt bent en je zorgen maakt, leer er dan over. Leer over de geschiedenis. Vertrouw niet op de mening van wie dan ook, mezelf incluis, of een stukje uit een tv-debat om tot conclusies te komen. Dus ja, mijn hart gaat uit naar de miljoenen Palestijnen die al zo lang lijden, vanwege de directe impact van bommen, geweren, pesterijen en ontheemding van hun huizen, en de teleurstelling van een wereld die doet alsof het niet zo erg is als het lijkt. En ja, dit kan geschreven worden en tegelijkertijd ook geraakt en bedroefd zijn om de onschuldige Isra√´lische mensen die hun levens hebben verloren of slachtoffer zijn geweest van iets dat hen hun leven lang zal meevolgen. Als de twijfel daarover het startpunt is van een debat of tegen argument, dan kan het gesprek helaas niet verder. Deze situatie is er geen van argumenten en tegen argumenten. Deze situatie is er een van een realiteit: het wordt toegelaten. Het meest afschuwelijke wordt toegelaten. Decennia lang.

facebook,"AFFECTIONATE PERO WALANG LABEL Hello, manghihingi sana ako ng advice, pero bago yon, kuwento ko muna kung ano ang happenings. Medyo mahaba ito. There's this guy na kagrupo ko sa thesis, hindi kami close nong una, pero habang nakakasama ko siya sa paggawa ng thesis ay napapalapit ang loob ko sa kanya. Until I started to have a crush on him last month. Sa thesis group kasi namin, madalas good vibes at (humorous) asaran ang nangyayari, tapos don ako sa asaran namin na-fall. HAHA! Kapag inaasar niya ako, inaasar ko rin siya. Safe naman kasi parehas kaming walang jowa (NBSB ako and I think NGSB rin siya, base lang sa aking research. HAHAHA!). Parehas din kasi kaming introvert at taong bahay. Tapos ito, feeling ko may something din siya para sa akin, e. Kapag gumagawa kami ng manuscript, madalas niya akong tabihan at minsan sinasandalan niya rin ako. May times na nagkakasabay kami pauwi dahil kaming dalawa yong parehas ng way, at kapag umuulan ay nakiki-share siya sa kin ng payong kahit may payong din siyang dala. Kapag nagyaya akong maglakad, sumasama siya. May isang beses na nasa tricycle kami, tapos ako naman ang naglakas-loob na sumandal sa balikat niya. His response? Sinandal niya rin ang ulo niya sa ulo ko, tapos nilagay niya yong kamay niya sa tuhod ko. After that, may dalawang beses na muntik na niya akong akbayan habang naglalakad kami, kaso binabawi niya, e. Marami na rin kaming naging group overnights para sa thesis at ganon pa rin, tinatabihan niya ako at inaasar. Tapos, kapag nagbabalot ako ng kumot kasi madali akong lamigin sa aircon, nakiki-share din siya sa kumot ko habang gumagawa kami ng manuscript. May times na dinidikit niya yong binti niya sa binti ko o di kaya ay ipapatong niya ang kamay niya sa tuhod ko. Hinahayaan ko naman siya kasi comfortable naman ako na kinikilig deep inside. HAHAHA! O di ba, feeling ko mag-jowa na kami kasi ang close namin physically. But, here comes the conflict. Kapag nag-uusap kaming dalawa ay tungkol lang din sa thesis or something related. Yong asaran namin ay nangyayari lang kapag kasama namin ang groupmates namin. Once ay nagkakuwentuhan naman kaming dalawa about sa mga nababasa naming stories kasi parehas kaming reader, pero magkaiba ng medium kasi siya sa manga, ako naman sa novel. Parang yon lang ang napag-usapan namin na tungkol sa amin. Hindi ko alam kung paano ko siya kakausapin personally, at hindi rin naman siya nag-i-initiate ng ganong convo. About thesis and school stuff lang talaga ang napapag-usapan. Minsan nga, as in tahimik lang kaming magkasama pauwi. Same thing sa chats. Hindi humahaba ang convo namin, saka minsan ang tagal din kasi niyang mag-reply, tapos ang dry ng messages niya. Tapos, kapag hindi kami gumagawa ng thesis, like papasok lang sa school ganon, bihira niya akong pansinin. Napapaisip tuloy ako na baka wala naman pala talaga siyang feelings para sa kin. Naguguluhan na ako kung ano ba tong meron sa pagitan namin, or kung meron ba talaga. Tingin niyo ba, dapat ko na siyang i-confront? I really like him. Tatanggapin ko kahit anong kalalabasan ng pag-uusap namin, gusto ko lang talagang malinawan. Kaso iniisip ko, baka hindi lang talaga siya ready at matakot ko. Hindi rin ako sanay sa confrontation, baka maiyak ako, iyakin pa naman ako kapag nag-overflow na ang feelings. HAHAHA! What do you think? Too soon for a confession, or i-push ko na?

facebook,"Unforgiveness causes conflict and creates obstacles in your relationship with God. It also undermines your connection with Him and sets you against those who could assist you. Forgiveness is the ultimate key to a life filled with power. One's ability to forgive quickly is a clear indicator of their knowledge of God. Whenever you seek God's mercy, He instructs you to begin with forgiveness. Unforgiveness leads to a failure of grace and inflicts more harm than the devil ever could. Unforgiveness tarnishes your grace amidst blessings. Inability to forgive signifies a lack of understanding of God, as Christianity is founded on forgiveness. Unforgiveness squanders offerings and sacrifices and perpetuates poverty. It hinders your access to financial blessings. Unresolved conflicts among individuals lead to conflicts between you and God. Bitterness is unproductive, and no one is deserving of hatred. Unforgiveness blinds you to any goodness in others. Genuine forgiveness is evident when you harbor goodwill, are willing to reconcile, abstain from gossip and revisiting past offenses, extend kindness, and think and speak positively about those who have wronged you. When you continue to act and live as you did before, never harboring resentment, it reflects true forgiveness.",,1383,"{'like_count': 1137, 'comment_count': 53, 'num_users': 305796}",Pst.

facebook,"As we begin to pray the rosary for peace, let us reflect on the words of Jesus, ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God"" (Matthew 5:9). We live in a world that is often divided by conflict, violence and war. People suffer from the devastating effects of war and are subject to merciless acts of violence. For this reason, we must seek peace in our world through prayer and action. As we pray the rosary, we remember the life of Mary, our Blessed Mother, who was an example of peace and humility. Mary always sought to glorify God and lead others to Him. Her life reminds us of the importance of listening to God‚Äôs voice and trusting in His love for us. Let us also remember the powerful intercession of the rosary. Through the prayers of Mary, we can ask for God‚Äôs mercy, peace and healing in our world. May the rosary bring peace to our hearts, homes and communities. May it inspire us to become peacemakers for the greater glory of God.

facebook,"True Words to Ease the Fears of Strife In today‚Äôs turbulent world, I find myself at a loss for words witnessing the unimaginable actions humans perpetrate against each other. It‚Äôs easy to perceive the world as dominated by negativity and despair. However, it is vital to remember the unparalleled power of the mind. When strong minds are directed toward peace and harmony, global change is within reach. According to the teachings of the Buddha, one pathway to harness such transformative power and convert adversity into an ally is through the potency of heartfelt aspirations. Drawing comfort from the Buddhist teachings I‚Äôve had the privilege to study, I want to share an enduring aspiration prayer. Held dear by many Tibetan practitioners through time, it was voiced by the revered saint, Thangtong Gyalpo. During a time of intense conflict in the Minyak region of Dokham, when it seemed no resolution was in sight, Thangtong Gyalpo arrived at the center of great unrest. With an enlightened heart, he recited a potent prayer that resulted in bountiful harvests and brought an end to that conflict. This profound recitation had instilled a sense of loving-kindness in its listeners, beckoning forth excellence and unity across the land. May we all find solace in the wisdom of such heartfelt aspirations, using them to usher in a world of peace and compassion. ‚Äìdpr Read more http://bit.ly/ponlopr:=:https://dpr.info/articles/true-words-to-ease-the-fears-of-strife/",,1090,"{'like_count': 596, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 204199}",Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche,,2023-10-15 00:29:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/160251003_281054470059386_3171548969124485278_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=Bc2wiaxFvZMAX9HGmpS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDxg3HLgt2myNrqe4Io56btm0Jgpj4fN44TBTsDzOLdxA&oe=657D2921,https://www.facebook.com/100044645048151/posts/860754668756027,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392822357_18388349080026419_2206941169995410821_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=TdfubJGHtLkAX-tGR1W&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCXyk18kOKWKuEcpuWj3vdNtbs1_Dcu_uoGTrsxw6kr_A&oe=655A9FC1

facebook,"There are a lot of questions around the war in Israel, and a lot of justified panic. One of the issues directly affecting Americans is how the war will influence the price of gas. Here‚Äôs Five Fast Facts About The War in Israel and Gas Prices: üìà Bump - The first Monday after the war began, global oil prices jumped by 4%. It was back to normal by the end of that week. üìâ Down In It - Even when you factor in that slight hop, oil prices are still down about 6% from September of last year. üçÅ Falling in Fall - Even better, if there is an increase in prices at the pump, it‚Äôs likely to be overridden by the usual decline in gas prices in the fall. Less people traveling for vacations means less cars filling up, and that causes prices to drop. üìä But Wait - There is a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù situation that needs to be factored into the equation. If the war is expanded to surrounding regions and includes other allies, prices could increase. Emphasis on the word ‚Äúcould.‚Äù üö¢ But Why? - Hamas, the terrorist group that carried out the attacks on Israel, is allegedly funded by Iran. There is no evidence as of this writing that Iran is involved. However, Iran is an oil producer and controls passage through the Strait of Hormuz, a route for about 15% of global oil supply. If conflict breaks out, that route could be impacted. üî•Bottom line: The short answer is that you don‚Äôt need to worry about gas prices increasing. Hopefully the war in Israel ends soon and we don‚Äôt need to worry about any part of this horrific situation.

At this time, I was still passionately pursuing the dream of crafting a concept album, and many of the songs seemed to align with a narrative of great conflict, exile, return, and the consequences that might ensue."" üéß Click here to experience ""Prodigal"" now: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hekztheband/september-exclusive-track-prodigal If you haven't already, you can join the HeKz Coffee Crew for ¬£3 a month and receive access to the full library of exclusive tracks (that's 23 and counting!) #Progressivemetal #Progmetal #NewMusic #Prodigal #ExclusiveTrack #HeKz",,989,"{'like_count': 829, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 3486}",HeKz,,2023-10-15 10:11:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/396136434_856462196323471_2080679321186727844_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3VHZl79CWJ0AX8zqHto&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA8LmdmswZg2BLKBKvIzimgzN3fqvC_svkdIwIYKKvqSA&oe=655B9EF0,https://www.facebook.com/100058790953757/posts/848703817099309,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387860007_848071517162539_7128647285915080723_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xzHgx4-u7AwAX-uODoO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA58jxOV0MGLcK52W_-yGuV7SoWWHyCLQt6OwIQGTyyIg&oe=654010DB

Insecure attachment represents a lack of connection to self the difficulty connecting to your partner. What is connection? Connection is a feeling of closeness and safety, a sharing of selves.

facebook,"üîôHow Olamide threatened Don Jazzy not to step foot on the Lagos ‚ÄòMainland following their clash at the annual Headies Awards ceremony in 2015. The biggest record label w@r and conflict resolution in Afrobeat's history. Olamide was so furious, that he declared war publicly. It all started when Reekado Banks (who was formerly signed to MAVIN Records)was announced the winner of Headies ‚ÄúNext Rated Award,‚Äù at the 2015 Headies Awards. This didn't go down well with Olamide (The Founder of YBNL Nation which has produced artists like; - Asake, Fireboy, Adekunle Gold...) Olamide climbed the Stage with his entire YBNL team and sent a powerful message, declaring Lil Kesh, the winner, according, to Baddosneh he said, ‚ÄúLil Kesh is our own Next Rated artist. F**k that sh*t! The streets ti take over. Every f**k!ng single was a hit back to back.‚Äù He dropped the mic in anger, leaving the stage with his YBNL squad while spilling his drink. Don Jazzy (The founder of MAVIN Records, which has produced stars like, Wande Coal, Tiwa Savage, Rema, Ayra Starr...) responded to Baddo's rant in a calm speech that said ‚ÄúEgbon Olamide, if you want the car, come and collect it‚Äù Afterward, Olamide came for Don Jazzy on X ( formerly Twitter) In several tweets Baddo declared war on Don Jazzy and even warned him not to step foot on the Mainland in Lagos. A similar warning reminds us of the already-seen feud that started the bl00*dy war between the late Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG. His words ‚Äú‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt f**k!ng come to the Mainland. Honestly, fu**k you, I am f**king Mainland‚Äù He also dragged Don Baba for how he treated his artists under MAVIN. Don Jazzy was very smart and saw what a war between the two biggest Recording labels across Africa would have led to. And he tendered a public apology to the YBNL family. It was later revealed in 2016 that Aliko Dangote settled the beef between Olamide & Don Jazzy after they clashed at the Headies in 2015 over the Next Rated Awards. Don Jazzy later expressed how he regretted his actions. As stated by him ""It was out of character. I regretted that instantly as soon as I came down from the stage. I apologized to the Headies organizers and Olamide as well.""",,912,"{'like_count': 839, 'comment_count': 30, 'num_users': 211235}",Afrobeats Ville,,2023-10-15 05:55:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339987535_1288011218735688_353819540018020921_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XJolw-ZFwIMAX9cnq36&_nc_oc=AQm2_AkbVCb9Er8LxRyBPhS7VfTWQX34B3RSvXGFFTIH4nuO1nxQBFZpAMLRpUJN9CI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAFYANUDPmnSQgw1NC994lFcYKXbATzxn_HxDODdpr5tw&oe=655ABA93,https://www.facebook.com/100085390040665/posts/294567840066215,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387874478_294477943408538_4703615452621695568_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xCl54thoSc4AX_oXrLm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC6eB0mGCtiRcJ2knmZo0OfZ0UENC6udT6ohDoa5u15UA&oe=65402C83

facebook,"What if every time we disagreed with someone, we took it as an invitation to a spiritual journey? Every disagreement, a stepping stone; every contrasting opinion, a guidepost leading us toward a greater understanding of this vast, complex universe, and our place within it. Let me pause here to clarify something vital: Understanding and love have their boundaries. There is no place in our quest for unity for hate speech, misinformation, or any form of injustice. These are the antithesis of enlightenment and unity; they're spiritual roadblocks, obstacles in our collective journey towards a higher realm of existence. You see, my friends, we often forget that each person is a world unto themselves, forged by experiences and understandings that we may know nothing of. The Lubavitcher Rebbe taught us that love is not about finding someone you can live with; it's about finding someone you can't imagine living without. What if we applied that kind of love universally? A love so encompassing that we couldn't imagine our world without even those we disagree with. In the words of the wisest King Solomon, ""Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another."" We often take this to mean conflict or friction, but what if we saw it as the creation of a spark? A divine spark that only comes into being when two opposing forces strive not for victory but for enlightenment, to understand and to be understood. When we disagree yet strive to understand, we're not weakening our own standpoint; we're elevating the whole discussion into a higher realm, one closer to the unity that underpins all of existence. And who knows, perhaps in that sacred space, you'll not only come to understand the person standing opposite you but also catch a glimpse of the Divine. May your words be bridges, may your understanding be a beacon that can guide and inspire others, and may your love for every soul guide you closer to the ultimate unity we all seek.",,809,"{'like_count': 370, 'comment_count': 34, 'num_users': 33189}",Rabbi Yisroel Bernath,,2023-10-15 02:21:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/332469622_882393476365875_8352353474016579393_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=lZ3eYX5DOegAX9I1UTG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDcQ-Q8n59GLMQKFPpoMNsatpRAvaA5qCErIyDg-CZsbQ&oe=655AD8E1,https://www.facebook.com/100063890252926/posts/757141323092203,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392944921_757141259758876_8237585266907756823_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rYJVYFnSX90AX_qZrS1&_nc_oc=AQn3UGtkE9W3TS1xMasuNQYfJgE32O2Shw_Bfs5XGCthQXBS9oTjKnFJ84uu5pIHGOE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBzt2o3NPD_IdDJNAc_9brvkpenTQKqJiWtAyfwBNG5oA&oe=6530A3E0

facebook,"I wrote a post about myself, an adult, not freaking out when my children said things that were factually incorrect because I knew they were playing at having that skill. Like pretending to read a sign, or drawing scribbles and then ‚Äúreading‚Äù them to me. The point of my post was that I don‚Äôt need to correct my children constantly in play and tell them ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not actually what that says‚Äù or things like that, because‚Ä¶they‚Äôre playing. They‚Äôre learning. Me correcting them only disrupts our relationship, the thing they were hoping to share with me. Someone asked, very reasonably so, in the comments about what to do with this when *you*, the adult, know how to go unbothered‚Ä¶but an older sibling doesn‚Äôt know how to let their younger sibling be ‚Äúwrong‚Äù without being bothered. Because the older sibling is coming from a childish and limited perspective too, and they can‚Äôt see that the little one is playing‚Ä¶all they can see is that they‚Äôre WRONG! This was my answer: I don't know how old the sibs are, but I *was* this older sibling my entire life. It felt very frustrating to feel like I knew that something was literally wrong, incorrect, factually untrue, lying, etc...and for the adults around me to brush it off as if it didn't matter. I mean, maybe in adult terms it *didn't* matter -- and obviously I didn't understand child development of my little siblings! -- but to me it felt like ‚ÄúWhat the heck, I value truth and justice and accuracy, why is no one else around me valuing it too????‚Äù I wonder whether ""leaning in"" to that with your older child might help? You could pull them aside to talk about it somewhere where it's not bothering little sib, keep patiently listening and empathizing, and then offer suggestions based on the specific situation after they truly feel heard. I wonder if they feel like they have to be the one ‚Äúholding down the fort‚Äù ‚Äî enforcing truth and justice and accuracy -- since it might seem to them like the adults around them don't care. (Even though you obviously do care! Since you're asking me! But that might not reflect their feelings.) Like the more you say ‚Äújust let it go,‚Äù they have to dig in even harder, because to them, the world obviously has a Right and a Wrong and if the adults won‚Äôt even care about that or see that, then they just have to entrench themselves even further in it to make sure that at least *somebody* is protecting the Right and the Wrong. Maybe if they felt super duper listened to and like you took what they were saying was important...like...10x as much as you tell them why it's actually *not* important...then maybe they wouldn't feel like they have to be the enforcer of it as much, and they'd lay off younger sib after awhile? Mine are pretty young -- 5 and 3 -- and both have slightly or moderately delayed language skills, so my direct experience in this as a parent is limited. But I do a lot of echoing back to each of my kids what they're saying, and accept that they might still be in conflict after that, or they might move on. Apollo gets super offended that Summer is not actually reading correctly, for example. S: That says ""Summer!"" Me: Oh, yeah? A: It does NOT. That is G. That says ""guh"". S: NOOOO! S FOR SUMMER!! Me: Oh, yeah, you're right, Apollo. It is a G, you learned that at school huh? S: It's S for Summer! Me: Oh Summer you're thinking of how the first letter in your name is an S? S: Yeah!!! A: That says G!! Like grape!!! Me: Oh yeah, G is the first letter in grape! Good thinking!! ...etc, etc. It does get exhausting, and it's not like the two of them resolved the conflict or even really understood what each other was talking about, but it's like I held two conversations at once to try to affirm what each of them was doing (one of them being factually correct; the other one playing, and being sort of correct, just in different ways.) Because neither of them are doing anything wrong. They‚Äôre just not currently doing the same thing, and they don‚Äôt have the skills yet to recognize that the other person might be doing something else and shift their play to match that. It‚Äôs part of a broader theme when my kids fight of reminding myself that I‚Äôm on nobody‚Äôs side (or to put it more positively, that we‚Äôre *all* a team). I am neither on ‚ÄúTeam Protect the Younger Sib Who‚Äôs Just Playing‚Äù nor am I on ‚ÄúTeam Side with the Older Sib who‚Äôs Factually Correct‚Äù. My goal is to make sure that both of them feel like they are understood by me, even if they‚Äôre not by one another, since I can‚Äôt manage their relationship with one another, only their relationship with me.",,635,"{'like_count': 337, 'comment_count': 50, 'num_users': 125070}",The Occuplaytional Therapist,,2023-10-15 13:33:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338946089_920695149236144_3689487133108857725_n.jpg?stp=c11.5.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p74x74&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=psq36SQHSaoAX_zhojY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAlQMbWvFFt_3csEmaon19TswX6ScUJhwHdPkchLmt9kA&oe=655B5E92,https://www.facebook.com/100068490722118/posts/644076481218704,

facebook,"Whether we like it or not, as born again believers, we were all made for WAR! The moment you and I got saved and filled with the Holy Spirit, was the exact moment that the enemy, the devil and all of his evil cohorts, placed a target on our backs. And the Bible is very clear about the domain in which that warfare takes place and it is not as we all suppose. We look at what is happening all around the world, and we assume that we are fighting terrorists, criminals, war-lords, witch doctors, politicians, globalists, bankers, economists, government officials, in-laws and out-laws, to name but a few. But the truth is, we are not. Our fight is NOT against flesh and blood but against demonic spirits that operate in the realm of the spirit! Jesus says something quite interesting in Matthew chapter 11 and verse 12: ‚ÄúAnd from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the VIOLENT take it by force.‚Äù (Matthew 11:12 NKJV) In others words, Jesus is saying, ‚ÄúYes, there is trouble in this world and there is conflict talking place, but it‚Äôs not a conflict that is being waged in the natural realm as much as it is in the spiritual realm. In other words, it‚Äôs a spiritual kingdom that suffers spiritual violence. But it‚Äôs the spiritually VIOLENT that oppose and resist it and take what is rightfully theirs, by force.‚Äù And He is looking for a generation who are willing to see the world that we're living in and decide that they're not going to give one more inch to the enemy; that it‚Äôs time to take back what the enemy has stolen from us. I promise you, our God is able, if we are willing to stand up and declare, ""Enough is enough""! Once again, we are so looking forward to seeing you all at our 8am and 10:30am services. I believe that bondages and strongholds are going to be dismantled and destroyed as we gather together in His Presence.

facebook,"Her Seductive, Charismatic Figure...... A summary of Cleopatra's life: Cleopatra was born in 69 BC in Alexandria, Egypt, and she was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. She became Queen of Egypt at a young age, co-ruling with her father and later with her younger brothers. Cleopatra was known for her intelligence, charisma, and fluency in multiple languages. She had romantic relationships with two of the most prominent Romans of her time, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. These relationships played a significant role in the politics of the Roman Republic. She was a shrewd diplomat and used her alliances with Caesar and Antony to secure Egypt's interests. After the death of Julius Caesar, she aligned herself with Mark Antony and had three children with him. However, her relationship with Mark Antony ultimately led to conflict with Octavian (later known as Augustus), the eventual first Roman Emperor. The Battle of Actium in 31 BC marked a decisive defeat for Antony and Cleopatra. Rather than being captured by her Roman adversaries, Cleopatra took her own life, possibly by being bitten by an asp, in 30 BC. With her death, Egypt was annexed by the Roman Empire, ending the Ptolemaic rule. Cleopatra's life and dramatic relationships with powerful Roman figures have made her an enduring and iconic historical figure, and her legacy continues to captivate the imagination through literature, art, and film.

facebook,"POSITION PAPER It took us a week to formulate this statement. We are a movement made up of Jewish and Arab women with diverse opinions and positions, and we found ourselves inside this crazy, threatening, horrible and frightening movie. There are no words in any language to describe what we all went through this past week. We are still searching for the right words that we can share at this moment. First of all, we mourn the brutal murder, in an indescribable and unforgiveable massacre carried out by Hamas, of over 1300 civilians, babies, children, women, men, the elderly, male and female soldiers, members of the security and rescue forces, among them Arab civilians and soldiers. We wish complete recovery and rehabilitation to the thousands injured in body and soul. We share the deep sorrow of members of Women Wage Peace who lost family members; we offer support to the members of the movement from the Gaza Envelope who survived the horrific inferno last Saturday; and we are terribly worried about the safety and fate of all those missing, kidnapped and abducted ‚Äì among them peace activist Vivian Silver from Kibbutz Beeri, a member of Women Wage Peace, and Ditza Heyman from Kibbutz Nir Oz, the mother of movement member, Neta Heiman. We demand that the Israeli government begin negotiations immediately for the release of all those who were abducted. We call on the Red Cross and the international community to ensure their safety and act for their immediate release. Despite the rage and pain in the face of the criminal and unforgiveable acts committed by Hamas, including incessant shelling of towns all over Israel, we must not lose human dignity. Even in the most difficult situations, it is our obligation as mothers, as women, as human beings and as an entire nation not to lose basic human values. We hear words of revenge all the time ‚Äì ‚Äúall restraints have been removed‚Äù, ‚Äúwe will wipe out Gaza‚Äù, ‚Äúwe will act brutally‚Äù. But one cannot resolve one injustice with another injustice. We grieve the death of innocent Palestinians, among them hundreds of children, who are being killed in this accursed war. The situation in Gaza is getting worse all the time. This war proves, more than ever, that the concept of ‚Äúmanaging the conflict‚Äù failed. The idea that dealing with the resolution of the conflict could be postponed indefinitely has been proved to be fundamentally wrong. For 9 years since the end of ‚ÄúOperation Protective Edge‚Äù, we, Jewish and Arab mothers have been telling the leadership in Israel ‚Äì enough! We must turn every stone in order to reach a political solution. This is our obligation for the future of our children. This is our obligation to both Israeli and Palestinian children. They deserve a future of security and freedom, not a future of death, war and destruction. Despite the complexity of the issue, we and the Palestinians have no choice but to strive for a resolution of the conflict. The Palestinian people will not disappear, nor will we. More wars, bombings, assassinations, arrests and a never-ending cycle of bloodshed will not allow us and our children to live here as normal people. All conflicts in the world have been resolved by peace agreements. Hamas acts to destroy any chance for peace. Hamas has already managed to destroy the negotiations with Saudi Arabia. Hamas must not be allowed to win! We know these words sound imaginary, na√Øve and unrealistic, but this is the truth, and we must recognize it. Every mother, Jewish and Arab, gives birth to her children to see them grow and flourish and not to bury them. That‚Äôs why, even today, amidst the pain and the feeling that the belief in peace has collapsed, we extend a hand in peace to the mothers of Gaza and the West Bank. We mothers, together with women from all over the world, must unite to stop this madness. It is our obligation to say, even if it is difficult to say this now ‚Äì Israel must consider its steps and actions responsibly and morally and prevent needless deaths of civilians and soldiers and, at the same time, wherever possible, prevent harm to innocent people in Gaza. We raise difficult questions and expect answers ‚Äì ground action, destruction of Gaza, forcing one million Palestinians to flee their homes ‚Äì will all of this lead to a future of security? And what will happen the day after? Isn‚Äôt it essential to deal with the issue of the abductees first? Do our leaders have the answers? We must maintain and strengthen the solidarity and unity between the Jewish and Arab public in Israel and continue to act against racism and hatred. The Arab public, which has lived for years with the internal conflict of being citizens of Israel and being part of the Palestinian people, rallied in this difficult time of crisis for the sake of the entire society in Israel. We demand that Israel prevent a flare-up in the West Bank and not allow extremist elements from both sides to incite the region, as has already happened this past week.

facebook,"üì∑: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at Al-Ittihadiya Palace in Cairo, Egypt, Oct. 15, 2023. üëâ Egypt's president criticized Israel‚Äôs military operation in Gaza in a stern pushback Sunday to the United States as America's top diplomat extended his frenetic travels across the Mideast trying to prevent the war with Hamas from igniting a broader regional conflict. With an Israeli ground offensive looming, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed in some of his strongest language to date that Washington would stand with Israel ‚Äútoday, tomorrow and every day‚Äù in a partnership of shared democratic values, but that Israel must take ‚Äúevery possible precaution to avoid harming civilian.‚Äù He leveled no direct public criticism of Israel or its bombing campaign that has killed civilians in Gaza. From Cairo, where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi conveyed his criticism, Blinken went to Jordan and planned to return to Israel on Monday, carrying to Israeli leaders the feedback he received in a rush of meetings with leaders throughout the Arab world. His second visit to Israel in recent days will come amid heightening fears that a looming Israeli move into Gaza could spark a wider war with devastating humanitarian consequences, a growing concern for the Biden administration. Egypt‚Äôs state-run media said el-Sisi told Blinken that Israel‚Äôs Gaza operation has exceeded ‚Äúthe right of self-defense‚Äù and turned into ‚Äúa collective punishment."" Blinken told reporters before leaving Egypt that ‚ÄúIsrael has the right, indeed it has the obligation to defend itself against these attacks from Hamas and to try to do what it can to make sure that this never happens again."" Mindful of the potential human cost in Gaza, Blinken said ""the way that Israel does this matters. It needs to do it in a way that affirms the shared values that we have for human life and human dignity, taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.‚Äô‚Äô (AP) https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-increases-readiness-for-massive-ground-assault-on-gaza/7311602.html",,541,"{'like_count': 322, 'comment_count': 150, 'num_users': 13090753}",Voice of America,,2023-10-15 18:00:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352992991_178766095145684_5027481947854717491_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=18ZZdScV7x8AX_v3UtK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA-0oRGDfzOgJKAktJbxD6u7JzyNcJUAbbN0bpHjZ8-Q&oe=655A6AC2,https://www.facebook.com/100064458353336/posts/712829854208953,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392945457_712828937542378_1207655896124461096_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QIaAPNIF3RcAX-2tBpf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfByWPNCh06rL3Lw69ckdtphDu_Ol6QqcllVupLQsr6Edw&oe=65304CA6

facebook,"Good afternoon folks , During this years Market Garden Commemorations we not only enjoyed a magnificent audience, we were heading towards the number of 28,000 followers. It might seem strange to you guys and ladies that follow us , but it must be remembered that as a page or group we have only been in existence for the past eight or nine years in total . Darren , my son and founder has been into Living History since he was sixteen. But having started out with ‚ÄúThe Acorn Gunners‚Äù He then founded ‚ÄúThe Far Setting Sun‚Äù with current Admin Simon Tierney. But since his early interest in Living History his true interest was always with The British Airborne Forces and is still as strong to this present day . A trip to Arnhem found us Paul Dutton whose expertise is The Royal Army Medical Corp . Both Darren & Paul took what is now our Jeep to Arnhem and they both enjoyed a very warm reception from the Dutch everywhere they appeared . We not only have Dutch admins Alex de Groot and Ernst Peters on board with us we also have Dutch Patron Jennifer van Venrooij-eisinger who over the past two years assists Patron Beverley Cooper when she represents The Arnhem Boys . Admin Nobby Clark a wizard with Jeeps is also a font of knowledge on The Airborne Recce and shares his time as the Official Standard Bearer for The Recce Association. Nobby also regularly accompanies us on show dates where with his MOD Training he takes our younger audiences through WW2 weaponry which over the last two years has become extremely successful with the youngsters and their parents, whose permission we always seek first . The name Living History brings to mind mock battles in period uniform etc . But as we‚Äôre growing we have become more of an educational group combined as an open air museum, depending on the location of each venue . We are fortunate to have a number of high profile Patrons who support our cause and on occasions come to events as well as we enjoy a huge following in Holland where we have over the years of attending the Dutch commemorations added to The Arnhem Boys Collection of genuine artefacts recovered from the areas of Arnhem and Oosterbeek. We have new members whom you‚Äôve already read posts from , Scott Goring , another Living history man who has his own Airborne Jeep & trailer a WW2 Motor cycle and his own collection of kit . A Mr. Jack Scott and like our Nobby has two Jeeps one of which is coming to fruition as a full Airborne Jeep. Our own Jeep is finished now as a full Airborne Jeep and her last excursion out to Bradwell Waterside saw her for the first time without her windscreen on and carrying her genuine Vickers K atop her scaffold Mount . BUT,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.For all our achievements our aim will always have a direct affiliation with why Darren chose the name we carry . People ask us why The Arnhem Boys ??. A lot of thought went into it‚Äôs being . There were so many different cap badges worn during Operation Market Garden. Each one entitled to be called Arnhem Boys . Hence our name as so many Regiments fought side by side and fought with honour and distinction. All those badges form what we know today as the veterans of that conflict . Our motto which is carried on our badge is what our aims are as a group , ‚Äú Keeping Our Past In Our Future ‚Äú ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The happy birthday posts for Ron Johnson I looked at last night before I went to bed 47.1K and nearly 2.0K shares. I asked a question the other day on how many of our veterans are still with us ? . Obviously with each year they get fewer as the natural aging factor affects us all ‚Ä¶ But those wonderful men will achieve something that none of us mere mortals ever will . As participants in Market Garden in their passing they‚Äôll attain immortality. Long after they‚Äôve gone students of history will learn about the conflicts they fought in . They‚Äôll read of individual names associated with the battle ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶men like Steve Morgan last man on the bridge . Many of our followers watched as Darren carried Steve‚Äôs ashes on their final journey back to Arnhem to lie with his fallen comrades in Oosterbeek Cemetery. As onlookers you couldn‚Äôt possibly know what was going through Darren‚Äôs mind . On that occasion he wore the shirt of 2 Para in honour of the warrior he was carrying in a special flask on his back . A whip aerial strapped to his back flying the flag . Darren was asked by so many of the veterans if he would personally take them home to their final resting place . This he achieved all but one, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶which was taken out of his hands . The dedication and rapore Darren had with many of our past veterans has helped make the reputation we enjoy to this present day . With this post Im including a video Darren dedicates to Steve Morgan . Steve produced a booklet which if you haven‚Äôt read it , I urge you all to do so. This message or post is from all of us here on The Arnhem Boys.

facebook,"üì∑: Palestinians line up as they wait to fill cans with fuel, amid shortages of fuel, as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues, at a petrol station in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, Oct. 15, 2023. üëâ The Red Cross said Saturday it was ""appalled"" by the human misery unleashed by the war between Hamas and Israel, saying its volunteers would not abandon those who needed them most. It called on both sides to abide by international humanitarian law, protect civilians and allow humanitarian organizations to alleviate the growing levels of suffering. ""The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is appalled to see the human misery that has unfolded over the last week in Israel and Gaza,"" with civilians paying the highest price, a statement said. Thousands of Palestinians sought refuge Saturday after Israel warned them to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip ahead of an expected ground offensive against Hamas, one week after the deadliest attack in Israel's history. ""Nothing can justify the horrific loss of civilian lives in Israel last weekend... but such tragedy cannot in turn justify the limitless destruction of Gaza,"" the Red Cross statement said. ""We are deeply alarmed by the call for relocation in Gaza. Our volunteers refuse to leave and abandon those who need them most. They must be protected -- so that they can protect others."" The joint statement was issued by the heads of both branches of the Red Cross Movement: Jagan Chapagain of the IFRC and Robert Mardini of the ICRC.

facebook,"DON'T KILL THE LOVE Many relationships and marriages end too soon, due to the couple's behaviour, actions, attitudes, etc. They stop sowing into the relationship and expect to harvest. They don't put into the relationship the same amount of effort, energy, passion, resources, interest, time to keep it as they did to earn the relationship. They end up blaming it on the words 'love' and ‚Äòcompatibility‚Äô. Love does not start on its own. The way it starts is the same way it is killed, by the actions of the couple but this time using unkind words, neglecting each other, turning their back on themselves. By empty assurances and pledges, being selfish and self-centered. By becoming impatient, proud and arrogant. Lacking empathy, not listening to each other‚Äôs needs but being critical and criticizing each other, is how they kill the love they share. They kill love in their relationship by not being truthful and honest but rather seeking pleasure in the flowering of lies. The love did not finish or varnish, they emptied it or drove it away. No human being is perfect or without faults so I wonder why people think there is someone out there they can co-exist with without conflict in the name of a relationship and call it compatibility. No matter who you end up with, there will be conflict which should tell you there is no one created to fit you or complete you. Conflicts and misunderstandings are part of a relationship or marriage. Therefore never leave a relationship or marriage too soon because of a few misunderstandings or conflicts if you want to make it work. Rather look for ways to make it work. Affection is greater than your conflict. Before you go to the family or court for a break up or call it quit, book for a counseling session. Because no one knows everything, it is always good to seek help. That is what makes you a better and stronger person. Counseling gives you support. Call or WhatsApp +233201435300.

Otherwise you‚Äôll never get so much as a glimpse of God"" - Hebrews 12:14 (MSG). - Frank Edem Adofoli (Counselor Adofoli) Counselor, ADR Practitioner, Conference Speaker, Author CEO, The Marriage Consult LTD.

(Pavlos Melas‚Äô letter to his family. Natalia P. Melas, Pavlos Melas, Athens-Ioannina 1992, second edition.) üîπThe Macedonian Struggle was a series of political and military conflicts that were mainly fought between Greeks and Bulgarians who lived in Ottoman Macedonia, from 1878. In order to strengthen Greek efforts, the Hellenic Macedonian Committee was founded (1903). Its members included many Greek notables, the diplomat Ion Dragoumis and the military officer Pavlos Melas among them. Its fighters were known as ‚ÄúMakedonomachoi‚Äù (Macedonian fighters). The rioting in Macedonia, especially the death in action of Pavlos Melas (1904), caused intense nationalistic feelings in Greece and led to the decision to send more volunteers to reinforce and better organise the armed bands. Though the conflict largely ceased by the Young Turk Revolution (1908), it continued as a low intensity insurgency until the Balkan Wars (1912-1913). üñºThe Macedonian Struggle.

facebook,"So here‚Äôs the thing. I think Daughter of the Empire by Raymond E. Feist and Janny Wurts is brilliant. I loved the original Riftwar Saga, but felt it had areas to improve on, particularly in that I wanted more focus on the female characters and how the Tsurani were sorely missed in the latter two books. This book manages to address a lot of those issues I had and then some. Mara is perhaps one of the most complex characters I‚Äôve read all year and following her journey was full of so many twists and turns that I can see why so many people hold this series in such high regard. However, I will say that the way a certain conflict during the climax is resolved felt a bit‚Ä¶ contrived. I won‚Äôt go too much into it here, but for a story where I couldn‚Äôt predict where it was going, that part felt a bit unearned. Maybe I‚Äôm misremembering the way the magic in this world works, but it felt a bit unearned. Regardless, I think that the middle section having to do with Mara and her husband has to be some of the best, most tragic writing I‚Äôve read in a while. Sets up what could have been and then rips you out heart out, I love it. Overall, a fantastic book, but the ending did make me less eager to jump into the next book, but no doubt that I will continue. Just not right away. For now, I‚Äôm giving Daughter of the Empire a solid 8/10 and would high recommend people to check it out for this fantastic character. Curious to see how the authors build on the setup of this book.

facebook,"Hebrew Igbo, are we Igbos one of the lost tribes of Israel? Cultural Evidence! The Igbos history uncannily parallels much of Jewish history in so many ways. Coincidence? I don‚Äôt think so. ‚ÄúBy placing the Igbos alongside other lost tribes of Israel in history, serious effort is being made here at the Almighty‚Äôs work, at helping to realize His word or promise of gathering back the scattered people of Israel from all four corners of the earth, and of restoring their fortunes (see Deut. 30:3-5; Jer. 32:26-42).‚Äù ‚Äì Prof. O. Alaezi 12.10.2023 Who are the Jews or the Jewish people? The Jews or the Jewish people, are an ethnoreligious group originating from the ancient Hebrews or Israelites, and whose traditional religion is Judaism. Jewish ethnicity, religion and community are highly interrelated, as Judaism is an ethnic religion, although not all Jews follow it. Despite this, practicing Jews regard individuals who formally converted to Judaism as part of the community. The Jewish people trace their origins to the Israelites, a people that emerged from within the Canaanite population to establish the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Judaism emerged from Yahwism, the religion of the Israelites, by the late 6th century BCE, with a theology considered by religious Jews to be the expression of a covenant with God established with the Israelites, their ancestors. The Babylonian captivity of Judahites following their kingdom's destruction, the movement of Jewish groups around the Mediterranean in the Hellenistic period, and subsequent periods of conflict and violent dispersion, such as the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars, gave rise to the Jewish diaspora. The Jewish diaspora is a wide dispersion of Jewish communities across the world that have maintained their sense of Jewish history, identity and culture. In the following millennia, Jewish diaspora communities coalesced into three major ethnic subdivisions according to where their ancestors settled: the Ashkenazim (Central and Eastern Europe), the Sephardim (initially in the Iberian Peninsula), and the Mizrahim (Middle East and North Africa). Prior to World War II, the global Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million, representing around 0.7 percent of the world population at that time. During World War II, approximately 6 million Jews throughout Europe were systematically murdered by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. Since then, the population has slowly risen again, and as of 2021, was estimated to be at 15.2‚Äì19.9 million by the Berman Jewish Data Bank, comprising less than 0.2 percent of the total world population. The modern State of Israel is the only country where Jews form a majority of the population. Jews have significantly influenced and contributed to the development and growth of human progress in many fields, both historically and in modern times, including in science and technology, philosophy, ethics, literature, governance, business, art, music, comedy, theater, cinema, architecture, food, medicine and religion. Jews wrote the Bible, founded Christianity, and had an indirect but profound influence on Islam. In these ways, Jews have also played a significant role in the development of Western culture. Hebrew Igbo, are we Igbos one of the lost tribes of Israel? Cultural Evidence: A good detective in sniffing out the truth must pay close attention to body language and culture of a people; this also may give away a person‚Äôs origins. For example, Germans often uncovered American spies by the way they counted on their fingers, where the use of the thumb comes in. By the way people act you can usually guess with fair accuracy where they may come from for example: ‚ÄúYes Ma‚Äôam, Thank you Miss.‚Äù Cultural protocol of the Southern U.S. People of Oriental and Asian cultures often bow to greet one another. Westerners generally shake hands when greeting others. Some cultures like some Middle Eastern and European cultures will kiss the cheek and embrace. These same cultures may spit when disgusted at someone or something. Some cultures have unique hand gestures to relay a message or emotion. Some cultures in the Orient and in Canada require people remove their shoes at the door upon entering their home. In 1789 Olaudah Equiano, an Igbo and former slave who lived in London said in his autobiography that the Igbos were one of the lost tribes of Israel and cited the many identical cultural similarities between them and the Jews. Missionaries when they came to Nigeria were dumbfounded to discover when they came to evangelize the Igbo People that the Igbo‚Äôs practiced many Hebraic/Jewish customs which they could not have learned from anyone else, it had to come from ancient practice of their people from antiquity; for they had no Bibles and met no one with a Bible until the missionaries came along.

facebook,"A large number of residents in northern Gaza have evacuated south, and the drinking water crisis has become a matter of ""life and death"" The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said today that tens of thousands of people are estimated to have fled after Israel ordered all residents of northern Gaza to evacuate southward within 24 hours late Thursday night New York time. However, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East stressed that many people, including pregnant women, children, the elderly and disabled people, are unable to leave and have no choice but to be protected at all times. UNRWA makes it clear that ""even war has rules"": civilians, hospitals, schools, clinics and United Nations premises cannot be targeted. The agency is sparing no effort to advocate with all parties to the conflict to implement their obligations under international law and to protect civilians, including those seeking refuge in UNRWA shelters. The WHO also stated that day that a plane had arrived at Egypt's Al-Arish Airport from the organization's logistics center in Dubai, carrying 78 cubic meters of medical supplies. Once humanitarian access is granted through the Rafah crossing, the supplies will be immediately transported to Gaza to meet critical health needs. These supplies include enough trauma drugs and medical supplies to treat 1,200 wounded and 1,500 patients with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and respiratory diseases, as well as other necessary health supplies to meet the needs of 300,000 people, including pregnant women. . Given that hospitals in Gaza are either inoperable or overwhelmed, and people's movements are restricted due to fighting, WHO has also provided trauma bags with enough medicine and supplies to treat 235 injured. With these trauma bags, injured people can be stabilized and receive immediate life-saving care wherever needed.",,418,"{'like_count': 61, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 56774}",Dolphin Foundation,,2023-10-15 10:08:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/362602255_241101445458086_7578237022876712284_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=uNfkYxnwt0IAX_0Z3VU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA4ZsWC1CzdrSIA_YrtD0zNMCNbEDy05aNSIyG3GNWplg&oe=655AE64B,https://www.facebook.com/100086746965361/posts/289903460577884,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387872134_289903433911220_3762815363448614123_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NxBNevuXHhEAX_2AW-B&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCnRSyP02vwGp364py4viuK1yLIJKWpZSdpQU2Bj3yXUg&oe=654BFF00

The group have rules for a reason. It is important that these rules are adhered to by all. Lisa and admin have the right to make decisions within those rules. Sometimes posts are not allowed where it is clear that it will cause derogatory chatter. That is against the rules. What we don't expect is for our members to then get argumentative and block admin in hope they can continue to post matters that conflict with the rules. As stated previously, if you block admin you are likely to be banned. We are here to help and support. We do not expect conflict aimed at us and it is not acceptable.

facebook,"The Hamas attack on Israel was the latest and one of the bloodiest episodes in a long history of war between Arabs and the Jewish state. UP political scientist Herman Kraft tells Howie Severino that the tensions began in 1948 when, backed by the United Nations but opposed by Arab states, Israel established itself as a state in what was then the territory of Palestine. As Israel, mostly a nation of European immigrants, won wars and became a military and economic power, Arab states sought peace, sidelining the nationalist interests of their Palestinian allies. As Israel prepares for a bloody occupation of Gaza, Kraft advises Filipinos to postpone any travels to Israel, even pilgrimages to Jerusalem, as the war could widen and drag on.",,418,"{'like_count': 261, 'comment_count': 58, 'num_users': 23029527}",GMA News,,2023-10-15 07:34:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/314390643_10161329649331977_7514181940279147654_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=0cy-S_pZs9gAX_LJt5h&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBsFoPJyLp__f8cgrJwuQNLNG7XZ-ztYfoCqM3GEh1Diw&oe=6559FFFB,https://www.facebook.com/100064849986224/posts/732893738882286,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/384519620_1129083654718167_6371632034669469314_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=7HEyecefmbsAX-ZGgor&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBt4PJqyqkTtoz1qtUlGNM4HH0bWmJhQmiza-NZOH9CtQ&oe=65308E6B

facebook,"Subject: Important Update Regarding Group Content Policy Dear Members, We wanted to address a recent development that has required us to adjust the content policy within our group. We value the sense of community that we have built together, and we appreciate your active participation. However, we must adapt to changing circumstances and strive to maintain a respectful and neutral environment for all our members. As many of you are aware, recent events in the Israel-Palestine conflict have resulted in an escalation of tensions and violence. In light of this, we have made the difficult decision to no longer accept posts related to this area or conflict or any political discussions within the group. Our aim is to keep the community focused on our shared interests while remaining neutral in matters that may lead to division and conflict. We want to emphasize that our decision is not an endorsement of war or politics in any form. It is our commitment to promoting a safe, respectful, and inclusive space for everyone. We understand that people have diverse opinions and feelings about this issue, but we believe that our group should remain free of political discussions and the potential harm that may arise from them. Additionally, we are taking steps to enforce our content policy more rigorously. We will be actively monitoring the group to identify and remove any individuals who engage in trolling, make nasty comments, or use derogatory emojis that mock the very real suffering of all parties involved in the conflict. Our priority is to maintain a supportive and positive atmosphere within our community. We regret having to make these changes but believe they are necessary to ensure that our group remains a place where members can connect and engage in a respectful and enjoyable manner. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in these difficult times. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns regarding these updates. Let's continue to support each other in our shared interests and remember the importance of treating one another with kindness and respect. Thank you for being a part of our community. Sincerely, Marian [Owner]",,407,"{'like_count': 301, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 2091594}",View from YOUR window,,2023-10-15 18:12:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/400714483_122138988662030055_1907105038178696459_n.jpg?stp=c0.5.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=SPmlTjVKKpgAX_xnxIj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDru-x9B6X30x5Xbhq1BQb8998CkwBmL7oqx_MG8UxPLQ&oe=655B1D89,https://www.facebook.com/groups/286866152596429/permalink/1116361769646859,
facebook,"Karen National Union's Official View on the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) addressed by Karen National Union's Central Executive Committee Member and Spokesperson P‚Äôdoh Saw Taw Nee October 15, 2023 We, the Karen National Union, have tried our best to resolve this long conflict that has been going on for many decades in our country. As our final attempt, we made a decision to actively participate in the nationwide ceasefire and political dialogue, using all available resources such as time and effort. However, in the end, the military dictators had violated all the agreements, effectively destroying the NCA and the political dialogue. As a result, we feel that the NCA agreement is no longer valid anymore. The heart of the NCA is clearly stated in Chapter (1) where it says political problems must be solved through political means. It is not acceptable for us when the military itself violated the agreement that they signed off on. In fact, the Myanmar military was already violating various terms agreed in the NCA even before the coup. Particularly, they absolutely failed to comply with the agreements from NCA Chapter (3) and (4). For example, they entered into our territories, Brigade 3 and 5, and started road construction without consulting with us at all as required by the NCA. It was a total violation of the NCA. Then there is plenty of evidence that they failed to protect the civilians as agreed in NCA Chapter (4). Then Chapter (5) on the agreement to hold state or sub-national level national political dialogue, we, the Karen, were able to organize one but other NCA signatory ethnic organizations were not allowed to organize one. Next, Chapter (6) which is about the interim arrangement where the signatory parties must first consult with each other before carrying out the activities in each other‚Äôs territories. The military did not comply with any of the agreements. As mentioned, the military had violated the terms of the NCA again and again even before the coup. Then, when the power craving military staged a coup in early 2021, everything was over. The NCA came to a halt. If you look at examples around the world, every time there is a military coup, the existing constitution is nullified. If you recall our recent history, when the military staged a coup in 1962, the 1947 Constitution went invalid. Then, when the military staged a coup again in 1988, their 1974 Constitution became invalid. However, the same military that staged a coup in 2021 kept saying that the peace process and the NCA are still valid under the 2008 Constitution (which they drafted and approved against the people‚Äôs will). They are just trying fool its citizens and the international communities. That‚Äôs why, we, the KNU, together with two other NCA signatories, Chin National Front (CNF) and All Burma Students‚Äô Democratic Front (ABSDF) had issued a joint statement a few days ago to make our official view known to the public that the NCA has been voided along with the military coup. Today, our shared goal is to establish a genuine federal democratic system in our country. But the main obstacle is the Myanmar military. They have been carrying out terror campaigns with deliberate targets against civilians, killing people, torching houses, wiping out the entire villages, launching heavy artilleries and air strikes. So far, at least 70,000 to 80,000 houses have been burnt to ashes nationwide. In our administered areas alone, there are more than 700,000 internally displaced people, and over 2 million displaced across the country. This has become a huge responsibility on us on how to take care of those massive number of displaced people. Therefore, first and foremost, it‚Äôs absolutely critical for us to first bring down this terrorist military regime. Second, I wanted to stress that we are opposing not only the military dictatorship. We will not accept civilian-led dictatorship either. If the military junta transfers power to another group of their hand-picked military elites as their exit strategy, it is still not acceptable to us. We‚Äôll have to continue to fight against them. We have officially stated such views in various statements already. Therefore, for any meaningful peace talk or political dialogue to take place, the atrocities must be absolutely stopped first. Then, the military must withdraw from the politics and stay under the civilian rule. Then, the issue of justice must be addressed during the transitional period and the perpetrators of the atrocities must be held accountable. Then, the military must agree that the new federal democratic country must be governed by a new constitution accepted by all. Last, the rebuilding of our nation must be an inclusive process where all the relevant stakeholders along and there must be a role of with the international support. Under current conditions, no meaningful peace talk can take place. With the coup, there is no legitimate government, no constitution and no parliament.

facebook,"Coronation Street star Chris Gascoyne has shared the first details of his exit from the role of Peter Barlow. Peter took centre stage in a huge storyline twist this week as he mowed down Stephen Reid on the cobbles, killing the Weatherfield villain almost instantly. Show bosses have now revealed that Peter will be arrested on suspicion of murder in Monday night's episode (October 16), which leaves him facing some tough questions from DS Swain and her team. While viewers will have to stay tuned to find out whether Peter is heading to jail, this storyline marks the beginning of the end for his time on the Street either way. Here, Chris Gascoyne ‚Äì who plays Peter ‚Äì shares some teasers of what's in store. Were you shocked when you found out that Peter would kill Stephen? ""It was Iain [MacLeod], the producer, who told me and I was not expecting it that's for sure. But I was pleased and I was keen to see how the story would pan out. ""When I read it, I loved that it kind of came out of nowhere. Hopefully it was not something that the audience was expecting. They knew that Peter was angry and was looking for Stephen, but although he had tried to beat him up at the flat, I don't think anyone saw that last moment coming until it happened. ""Peter was one of the few people who was not on the street at that point and then he came out of nowhere."" How did Peter get to the stage where he was prepared to kill someone? ""What has happened throughout the week is that Peter had got himself more and more wound up, so he was not in control of what he was doing. He was not thinking rationally. He'd gone into some weird place that he can sometimes get into, and he can't stop that. I think that's what has happened there. ""He wound himself up to a point where he had tunnel vision and thinks he is being the hero, but was he being a hero? That is where the story goes from here, what was his real intention? I've really, really enjoyed playing this story out and there is so much more to come."" Carla had asked Peter to stay out of it, but did that leave him frustrated? ""Because Peter felt he was doing it for Carla, he ignored her and wouldn't let it drop. It was too hard for him to sit back and do nothing once he knew what Stephen had done to Carla. ""I was surprised Peter managed to last as long as he did. He had put it on the backburner, but it was ignited again as more and more things started to come out. He was determined to find Stephen and once he knew he was back on the street he was determined to get to him. ""That said, I don't think he drove there with the intention of doing what he did."" How important was it to you that this was kept back as a shock moment? ""I was delighted that it was done that way. There are two ways you can do these sort of things ‚Äì you can telegraph it and get the audience on board with what is coming and some people like taking the audience on the journey. ""Or in certain situations you can go all out for the shock value and I think that worked brilliantly for Stephen's death. I am someone who likes to be shocked or surprised so this appealed to me."" How does Peter react when he's arrested and questioned next week? ""He is shocked that he is being arrested and questioned for murder. As the week starts, he is certain that he saved Jenny's life and he can't understand why he is being asked about his motivation for running him over. At this point, that is his frame of mind and he is still feeling a certain amount of justification for what he did."" Peter starts to question his own motive and doubt himself, doesn't he? ""Yes, when other people who saw what happened start to question it, he starts to doubt himself. He starts to lose control and a whole internal monologue starts in his head. He starts to think: 'What have I done? Was Jenny in danger? Could I have done something different? Would it have been better if Stephen had been arrested?'"" Does this story now become Peter's story? ""Yes, that is what is great about this for me. This is where Stephen's story ends and mine picks up. Peter is a man who is in deep conflict with himself. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how it happened ‚Äì he has killed someone. ""It is impossible to imagine what that must feel like. Could you ever rest, could you sleep? He actually says: 'I have taken another human being out of this world forever, what kind of person does that? What does that make me?' And he is terrified."" How does Peter cope with the reaction of those around him? ""This is the other thing ‚Äì he has killed someone that everyone knew and whatever that person did, he has taken away someone's son, uncle, brother. ""I think Audrey needs somebody to blame. She does blame him because she believes he didn't have to kill him. But in Peter's world, he thought he did have to kill him because Stephen had killed everybody else and he had a bottle to Jenny's neck. ""The truth is, underneath it, Peter took away Audrey's son. So he can't say: 'Oh God, I didn't do (truncated)",,378,"{'like_count': 239, 'comment_count': 51, 'num_users': 31198}","Soap Spoilers, Secrets and Gossip",,2023-10-15 07:51:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/301504795_513001747494235_1809948151619019822_n.jpg?stp=c51.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=BYi82TdP3WoAX9FDM4g&_nc_oc=AQksOKegBu6DQJv8lU7TdFDkDzQGXBUFooTzh77JzdqBX_rBZS2idQoC0nzrItP6yZs&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB7t8H1ZSxt_ffQzl1JfT2--DMws8C541zDXq6IpdqSlQ&oe=655A57D6,https://www.facebook.com/100063532413658/posts/838238284970578,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391613562_838238291637244_5848009439226027766_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=P_sIpFBSOF8AX-4AnfZ&_nc_oc=AQkjWnImJVL5bg9BsFlJCSkDA8FDe-yoilo8Fqk8GVgvc2nVQss8g6kk-qSgP5_Fvfk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAbWq_ntgOyvGY7lZhEgn0n3RUUWXqt3_eknJsR91wZMA&oe=65312B56

facebook,"October 15 marks six months since the outbreak of the tragic and senseless conflict in Sudan. Sudan is suffering a mounting displacement crisis and significant further deterioration in the humanitarian situation. More than 5.8 million civilians have been forced to flee their homes since April 15, including more than 1.1 million who have fled to neighboring countries. Humanitarian actors are bravely responding, but they are struggling to reach those in need because of intense fighting and impediments imposed by SAF and RSF. The United States remains the largest humanitarian donor to Sudan and we will continue our support for vulnerable populations in the country and those forced to flee due to the conflict. The United States has been clear that the SAF and RSF must immediately stop the fighting and ‚Äì consistent with their commitments under the May 11 Jeddah Declaration of Principles to Protect the Civilians of Sudan ‚Äì allow unhindered humanitarian access, protect civilians and their human rights, and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law. In the context of a negotiated exit from the conflict, Sudan‚Äôs democratic transition must be restored with the transfer of power to a civilian transitional government. As we acknowledge another somber milestone in the Sudan conflict, we reiterate our support for the Sudanese people and their aspirations for freedom, peace and justice.",,364,"{'like_count': 210, 'comment_count': 74, 'num_users': 293900}",U.S. Embassy Khartoum,,2023-10-15 15:43:49,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242659027_221176043379834_6653552390210730694_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GBhpKTRH6sMAX_UYcLR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAkro3BF5SGlnshQphAsii-ZtXqJg-UJML1qQJwKX9yjg&oe=655B4314,https://www.facebook.com/100064623192455/posts/713675610796539,

Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles 2. Delegation: is one of the core responsibilities of a leader. The goal isn‚Äôt just to free yourself up ‚Äî it‚Äôs also to enable your direct reports to grow, facilitate teamwork, provide autonomy, and lead to better decision-making. 3. Communication: leaders are skilled communicators who are able to communicate in a variety of ways, from transmitting information to inspiring others. 4. Self-Awareness: The better you understand yourself and recognize your own strengths and weaknesses, the more effective you can be as a leader. 5. Gratitude- Being thankful can lead to higher self-esteem, reduced depression and anxiety, and better sleep. Gratitude can even make you a better leader. 6. Learning agility is the ability to know what to do when you don‚Äôt know what to do. If you‚Äôre a ‚Äúquick study‚Äù or are able to excel in unfamiliar circumstances, you might already be learning agile. 7. Influence is quite different from manipulation, and it needs to be done authentically and transparently. It requires emotional intelligence and trust. 8. Empathy; showing more inclusive leadership and empathetic behaviors toward your child 9. Courage; Rather than avoiding problems or allowing conflicts to fester, having courage enables leaders to step up and move things in the right direction. 10. Treating your children with respect on a daily basis is one of the most important things a leader can do. It will ease tensions and conflict, create trust, and improve effectiveness.

facebook,"WHY CHRISTIANS MUST SUPPORT AND STAND WITH PALESTINE The on-going October 2023 conflict, which is more accurately, the effort for the Israeli state to annex Palestine has been on-going even before the declaration of the Israeli state in 1948. Despite this systematic and violent apartheid and settler colonialism against Palestine, Christian churches and institutions have supported the Israeli side either on misguided grounds or with dubious intentions. In the spirit of letting justice and righteousness roll down like waters (Amos 5:24), the ecumenical youth group Student Christian Movement of the Philippines feels the need to urge fellow Christians to stand with Palestine and condemn Israeli Zionist settler colonialism. The SCMP lists the following reasons: 1. Biblical Israel is different from the state of Palestine The British Empire back then, with the goal of weakening the Ottoman Empire, had promised independence for both Arabs and Zionists, Jews from Europe whose goal was to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, if they resisted the Ottomans. The British facilitated the settling down of Zionists in Palestine without consulting Palestinians. Moreover, the British carved-up the Ottoman Empire in order to protect its interest in Gulf oil and the route to its then-colony India. In the meantime, European leaders were not also interested in ending anti-semitism in their own countries. British politicians like Prime Minister David Lloyd George even believed that gathering Jews in Palestine would trigger the events in the Revelation, a belief that would be inherited by conservative and influential Christian pastors like John Hagee who justified holocaust as an urge for the Jews to settle in Palestine. Thus, modern Israel is a state born out of unjust, selfish, and even anti-semitic geopolitical interests. In Exodus, God chose the Hebrew people, later called Israel, because they were crying out because of their slavery. Today‚Äôs Israel simply cannot inherit the Biblical title because Israel is committing settler colonialism and apartheid to Palestinians, a far cry from the Biblical mandate to establish a community of justice. 2. Israeli economic and political support also comes from literal, genocidal way of reading the Bible Many conservative Christians, especially those coming from the United States who believe that Israeli settler colonialism is literal fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy for the end times, have had considerable influence especially on Republicans, but also on Democrats, and is something that Israeli leaders like Netanyahu himself have thanked for. American NGOs and charities have also gathered money, resources, and support for Israeli soldiers and for Israeli settler activities like illegal Israeli settlements. 3. Israel is a settler colony Zionists are not simply doing migration to Palestine‚Äìit is settler colonialism. Israeli authorities have incurred a strategic and systematic fragmentation of Palestinian territory reflected in the policies and actual actions of Israeli authorities. These include: building walls and guard towers that limit and constrict the Palestinian population, various genocidal actions and other human rights violations against Palestinians, demolitions of farms and homes of Palestinians, real estate colonization of lands ‚Äòassigned‚Äô to Palestinians. 4. Israel has committed unmeasurable HRVs There have been 5,590 Palestinian deaths from 2008 to 2020. An estimated a million Palestinians have been incarcerated since 1967. Gaza, which is heavily and fully blockaded, is considered as the world‚Äôs largest open-air prison. Israel has been called out continuously by the UN and other human rights groups for massively violating international law, including its said recent use of white phosphorus. Palestinians are considered as second-class citizens even within their territory. Many Palestinian communities have been deliberately cut-off from utilities. These verifiable conditions only tell a fraction of the sinful and deadly society Zionists have imposed against Palestinians. 5. Israel has even persecuted Christians The on-going conflict is not a Jews against Muslims because Israeli forces have also attacked Christians and Jews but are Palestinians. Israel authorities have also attacked and harassed Jews who side with the Palestinian cause. Israeli forces shot journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian Arab Christian on May 11, 2022. Even her funeral was even attacked by Israeli police. Additionally, Israeli militants have also desecrated Christian and Islamic holy sites. 6. Israel and the US have systematically poured fake news against Palestinians Fake news such as Palestinians beheading babies and raping women have not had corroboration, but are spread quickly by mainstream media, compared to, for example, videos of Israeli military attacking civilian targets. Israeli propaganda is also built on a million-dollar troll army. The US spreads deceitful and (truncated)",,341,"{'like_count': 43, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 11376}",Student Christian Movement of the Philippines - SCMP,,2023-10-15 14:07:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/322366256_1136215290588701_4207597467560560692_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2orDXib_LuYAX9-xee6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBPMQ6M9YY4WuLbCE2Yb10T7Qbu9clHtbohy6Qtir-tKA&oe=655A4EFE,https://www.facebook.com/100064320116657/posts/708595341294463,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391552915_708592681294729_5184329648867728723_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7SGWCSlSGoQAX91a932&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDV-lrMOxr6iuBQcDnGLq9TxZvnF_bqo6WesIV4zjjk4A&oe=6530A812

facebook,"The Hamas attack on Israel was the latest and one of the bloodiest episodes in a long history of war between Arabs and the Jewish state. UP political scientist Herman Kraft tells Howie Severino that the tensions began in 1948 when, backed by the United Nations but opposed by Arab states, Israel established itself as a state in what was then the territory of Palestine. As Israel, mostly a nation of European immigrants, won wars and became a military and economic power, Arab states sought peace, sidelining the nationalist interests of their Palestinian allies. As Israel prepares for a bloody occupation of Gaza, Kraft advises Filipinos to postpone any travels to Israel, even pilgrimages to Jerusalem, as the war could widen and drag on.",,333,"{'like_count': 170, 'comment_count': 102, 'num_users': 10405016}",24 Oras,,2023-10-15 11:00:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352567824_755101926308508_1412111241959267918_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Zns1o1CQrroAX_Vzzgl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDwIvx9Iwnb6Td2IremCb4zvzMKlklupOg6pMmxawtzbw&oe=655B0E17,https://www.facebook.com/100069304665221/posts/648851457435004,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/384519620_1129083654718167_6371632034669469314_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=op-bYJCMLpMAX_eu0XU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAQ18xOQjkCGnL9PfpDFF4WcHTN8cUZFl2fTrSc3JipRA&oe=65367D2B
facebook,"A now deceased 6-year-old Plainfield, Illinois boy stabbed 26 times because he is Palestinian, according to Wills County Sheriff's department. His mother, 32-years-old, was also stabbed several dozen times. Officials say the alleged murderer was the mother and son's landlord. Reports indicate he had recently been convinced of the false online narrative that is being shared by alarmists on the internet. The false narrative is claiming there will be attacks on American soil by ""Palestinian sympathizers"" during the Middle East conflict. Yesterday, a 32-year-old woman called 911 begging for help. She had been stabbed dozens of times by her landlord. Her child was also stabbed several dozens of times in his chest and body. Officials were shocked the woman was physically able to place the 911 call. Officials arrived at 16200 block of S. Lincoln highway to find the 71-year-old assailant, Joseph Czuba, was sitting outside of the home of the two victims covered in blood. He showed no remorse. When deputies arrived they found a 6-year-old boy, Wadea Shahin, bleeding to death. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. The child had defensive wounds (stab wounds) all over his arms from trying to stop the 26 separate stab wounds to his torso. His mother, also bleeding to death, 32-year-old Hanaan Shahin was discovered with several dozen stab wounds. According to officials, Ms. Shahin fought very hard for her and her son's life. She had serious defensive wounds as well as dozens of stab wounds to her chest, stomach and arms. She is in critical condition but expected to survive. Wills County Sheriff's department said this was a hate crime. Czuba is being charged with 2 hate crimes, first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. We do not write about politics, or religion on this page.

We stay away from polarizing subjects. I wasn't going to share this following information, but I feel as if I should now. Last week, Ricky and I spent two nights in a row, until 3:00 a.m. both nights, essentially mornings, reassuring mothers that they could send their children to school in Marion and surrounding Counties. Many of them were terrified of sending their children because they had heard online that there would be an attack on our soil. I spent many hours sending them accurate news, showing them that it was just fear mongering and not an actual threat. After the first day of sending their children to school and seeing everything was safe, they continued to send their children to school and thanked us for reassuring them. I know social media can be scary, especially when many people are sharing a false narrative that is terrifying. We base everything in facts on this page. Anthony Blinken, U.S. Diplomat and Secretary of State, has assured Americans, ""There is absolutely no threat to the United States after the Hamas attack overseas.""

facebook,"CHILDREN OF LIGHT‚Äî‚ÄîNewton and the Trinity Newton, the father of modern science, served as the President of the Royal Society at the age of 60 and was knighted by the Queen of England. When he died, he was buried in Westminster Abbey, like many outstanding British people. He was the first scientist in human history to receive a state funeral. In 2003, in a global selection of the greatest Britons by the BBC, Newton was named the first. He was a devout Christian, but Newton was also a Christian who resolutely opposed the doctrine of the ‚ÄúTrinity‚Äù. As we know, the Trinity is the core doctrine of Christianity. His views were considered heretical by all mainstream churches at the time. Then why didn't the church trouble him? Not because he was too famous, but because he concealed his views. From his 1.5-million-word manuscript, later generations were able to know that he was an anti-traditional Christian, also known as a heretic. So, what exactly is the Trinity? Why did Newton object to it? Simply put, the Trinity means that there is only one God and that God has three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The ‚ÄúWei‚Äù of the ‚ÄúSan Wei Yi Ti‚Äù [Trinity in Chinese] does not mean digits but persons, and the ‚ÄúTi‚Äù does not mean the body but the essence. The three persons represent the three forms of existence of God, but there is only one essence. That is to say, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit all refer to God in essence. It means one God rather than three Gods, which is called the Trinity in English. However, there is no such word in the Bible, and early Christianity did not have this concept at the beginning. The 27 books of the New Testament were all written by the disciples of Jesus or the disciples of the disciples. The canonical catalog was not determined until 397 A.D. Therefore, the various teachings of the early New Testament were discussed and concluded by priests, theologians, and bishops. The doctrine of the Trinity also experienced nearly 300 years of development, which became a big controversy by 318 A.D. In Alexandria at the time, there was a very prestigious elder named Arius who represented the Arianism sect. They believed that Christ was a creature because he was the Son of God. It cannot be said that he was both a creature and a creator, or that he was both a son and a father. It doesn't make logical sense. Therefore, the Son should be inferior to the Father. At that time, the Pope Alexander I represented another sect. They believed that the Son was not created and that if God is as the Father is, then the Son is as well. Otherwise, what Christians worship is a creature, which is absolutely unacceptable. The Pope Alexander I dismissed Arius after their outburst of conflict, but Arius gained the support of many local believers and bishops in eastern Rome. The believers supported him with demonstrations, and bishops from other places also wrote letters to agree with him. Things got bigger and bigger, and eventually they reached Constantine the Great. Although he knew nothing about theology, he was willing to interfere with the church and decided to hold a general meeting to settle the dispute. In 325 A.D., the First Ecumenical Council in the history of Christianity was held in Nicaea. More than 300 bishops were present, and Arius was not eligible to participate in this meeting of bishops. A bishop named Eusebius became the leader of Arianism. He believed that Arius' teachings were logical and completely correct. The sect of Pope Alexander I felt that Arianism threatened the status of the Pope, and there must be no compromise. After a fierce debate, the sect of Pope Alexander I won. Everyone knows how they won, so the First Ecumenical Council finally formed the Nicene Creed. The original text of the Nicene Creed states, ‚ÄúI believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.‚Äù Most of the bishops signed the creed, and those Arian bishops who refused to sign were declared heretics by the council and excommunicated. Constantine the Great also exiled the deposed bishops. But the combat was not over. After the death of Pope Alexander I, his secretary, Athanasius, became the new Athanasius I of Alexandria and the strongest opponent of the Arians. A few years later, Bishop Eusebius and his disciples succeeded in persuading Constantine the Great, who in turn supported the Arians and exiled Athanasius instead. In 338 A.D., when Constantine the Great was dying, he asked Bishop Eusebius to baptize him. Most of the heirs‚Äô successors also supported the Arians. Until 381 A.D., that is, more than forty years later, Emperor Theodosius firmly supported the Nicene Creed and held the Second Council of Nicaea. Those bishops believed that Christians could only worship Christ, who was indistinguishable (truncated)",,281,"{'like_count': 126, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 40207}",Light of Wisdom Church,,2023-10-15 23:30:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311593504_3268244373504873_1172847286858412068_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GXnZmGFGVMQAX8KNu8e&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDxrDWn9WIOSakJOQTGjKcis5Qf8ixcjYl5awa67c0fCA&oe=655A92E9,https://www.facebook.com/100086667552238/posts/292072740358309,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/389362213_267552975694621_9220344347759799584_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=Nu-XLM8FnskAX_d9iRI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAprlzC77gLjYM-gukThZXMFxp-78VTTzKLcyyweBwdyQ&oe=6530A41C

facebook,"PLAINFIELD TOWNSHIP HOMICIDE UPDATE

On 10/14/2023 at approximately 11:38 AM, deputies with the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office were sent to a residence located near the 16200 block of S. Lincoln Highway in Unincorporated Plainfield Township regarding a stabbing that occurred involving a landlord and renter.
 
When police personnel arrived on scene they located the suspect, Joseph M. Czuba (age 71) of Plainfield sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence.  Joseph Czuba had a laceration to his forehead and was later transported to a local area hospital for treatment.
 
Deputies located two victims inside the residence in a bedroom.  Both victims had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso, and upper extremities.  Both victims were transported to a local area hospital for treatment.  The thirty-two (32) year-old female was transported in serious condition and had over a dozen stab wounds to her body.  The female victim is recovering from her injuries at a local area hospital and is expected to survive this brutal attack.
 
It was initially reported to police personnel that the juvenile victim was eight-years-old.  That initial information was incorrect, and juvenile victim is six (6) years-old.  The six-year-old male was transported to the hospital in critical condition.  The boy later succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased by a doctor.  On 10/15/2023, an autopsy was conducted on the six-year-old victim.  The forensic pathologist conducting the autopsy removed the knife from the abdomen of the boy at that time.  The six-year-old boy was stabbed twenty-six (26) times throughout his body.  The knife used in this attack is a twelve-inch serrated military style knife that has a seven-inch blade.
 
The suspect, Joseph M. Czuba, was treated and released from a local area hospital and was transported to the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office Public Safety Complex for questioning by detectives.  Joseph Czuba did not make any statements to detectives regarding his involvement in this heinous attack.  Despite the suspect not providing a statement to detectives, personnel were able to gather enough information through interviews and evidence to formally charge Joseph Czuba with numerous criminal offenses.
 
Joseph Czuba was charged with First Degree Murder, Attempted First Degree Murder, Hate Crime (2 counts), and Aggravated Battery with a Deadly Weapon.  Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.
 
The Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office would like to thank the Will County State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs Office for their assistance in working with detectives regarding Joseph Czuba being formally charged in this senseless and cowardly act of violence.  Joseph Czuba was transported to the Will County Adult Detention Facility and is awaiting his initial court appearance.",,276,"{'like_count': 10, 'comment_count': 69, 'num_users': 38756}","WCSJ Radio Morris,IL The Voice of Grundy County",,2023-10-15 19:02:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292776258_439991431469875_5660430789682283910_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3P9DBxs26NQAX8Yjgjo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAfsxw5OkbPTF9A189jS_Ynx925jZ08W14TRyGATWyMAQ&oe=655B8A13,https://www.facebook.com/100063770641463/posts/784850563650625,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393011090_707625271409860_8339030141166032365_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QGua95UVMlEAX8GdOY7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAcQ4EZjvtlOEPxmCdEXNCXCKUOtdbF78jkEinZeZ-Jog&oe=653BB51A

facebook,"#ChurchTrivia: THE FOUR WOMEN WHO ARE 'DOCTORS OF THE CHURCH' Today, we are celebrating the memorial of St. Teresa of Avila. St. Teresa of 'Jesus' was the first of only four women to have been named doctor of the church. Her ascetic doctrine and Carmelite reforms shaped Roman Catholic contemplative life, and her writings on the Christian soul's journey to God are considered masterpieces. Highlighted in this post are the other three female saints who bear the title ""Doctor of the Church"", which is given since the Middle Ages to selected holy people whose writing or preaching is remarkable for guiding the faithful in all periods of the Church's history. ‚Ä¢ ST. TERESA OF AVILA Born on March 28, 1515, Teresa was known as a spitfire. She was not satisfied with a mediocre life and was inspired by God to help with the reform of the Carmelite order. Teresa worked with St. John of the Cross (another Doctor of the Church) to reinvigorate the Carmelites and return them to a faithful life of contemplative prayer. Her strenuous work of reform made her the target of persecution from within the Church, which proved to be a great cross for her. She was also a great mystic and her spiritual writings, such as The Interior Castle, continue to provide spiritual sustenance to many. ‚Ä¢ ST. CATHERINE OF SIENA Caterina Benincasa was born in Siena, Italy, on March 25, 1347. As a young girl Catherine had a vision of Christ seated in glory with Sts. Peter, Paul and John next to him, and it inspired her to make a private vow, dedicating her life to God. When she refused to get married, Catherine‚Äôs parents recognized the holiness of their daughter and made a private cell ‚Äî like the room of a nun ‚Äî that Catherine could live and pray in. Catherine eventually became a ‚ÄúThird Order‚Äù Dominican, leading a life of prayer while being active in the world. She wasn‚Äôt afraid of conflict and even traveled to Avignon, France, where Pope Gregory XI was residing and spent three months trying to convince him to return to Rome. Going against his closest advisors, Gregory eventually did go back to Rome and returned the papacy to the Eternal City. ‚Ä¢ ST. TH√âR√àSE OF LISIEUX Born on January 2, 1873, Th√©r√®se was a stubborn little girl who experienced a profound conversion in her life at age 13. After that moment Th√©r√®se drew closer to God and felt called to pursue the religious life. At the age of 15 she was convinced that God was calling her to enter a local Carmelite order, but the local superior and bishop would not allow it. Refusing to be dissuaded, Th√©r√®se was so bold as to ask Pope Leo XIII for permission to enter at her young age while on pilgrimage in Rome. Her actions caught the attention of local leadership, who permitted the girl to become a nun at 15. Her life was hidden to the world until her death at age 24, when shortly after her spiritual autobiography, Story of a Soul, became a ‚Äúbestseller‚Äù around the world and inspired countless souls with her signature ‚Äúlittle way‚Äù of holiness. ‚Ä¢ ST. HILDEGARD OF BINGEN Hildegard was born around 1098 in Germany and experienced mystical visions from an early age. She eventually joined a local Benedictine convent and became their superior. Her life and writings were highly influential. Pope Benedict XVI explained in a letter the many reasons why she was named a ‚ÄúDoctor of the Church.‚Äù The attribution of the title of Doctor of the Universal Church to Hildegard of Bingen has great significance for today‚Äôs world and an extraordinary importance for women. In Hildegard are expressed the most noble values of womanhood: hence the presence of women in the Church and in society is also illumined by her presence, both from the perspective of scientific research and that of pastoral activity. Her ability to speak to those who were far from the faith and from the Church make Hildegard a credible witness of the new evangelization.",,274,"{'like_count': 158, 'comment_count': 33, 'num_users': 193281}",St Anthony of Padua family,,2023-10-15 03:51:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/269852705_242227874724315_8416694457420897719_n.jpg?stp=c0.8.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3_Ma6UyWlVEAX9r5aQJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAaCIcii5S3E1krwMbkz_JNDDKHHDU911LQnqEGsZ80eg&oe=6559F76F,https://www.facebook.com/groups/486577778357082/permalink/2047264262288418,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391744600_10211858284250649_9140592373402388528_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=JT0er2WjHDEAX-Gz5Pa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDcZ4h0aqCxoZrs6qnVSOLigArIgIsK0gh7e0TI7f-KSQ&oe=6534788B

facebook,"Saint Gregory the Illuminator Church,[a] commonly referred to as the Armenian Church of Baku (Armenian: ‘≤’°÷Ñ’æ’´ ’∞’°’µ’Ø’°’Ø’°’∂ ’•’Ø’•’≤’•÷Å’´, Bak‚Äôvi haykakan yekeghetsi; Azerbaijani: Bakƒ± erm…ôni kils…ôsi), is a former Armenian Apostolic church near Fountains Square in central Baku, Azerbaijan. Completed in 1869 it was one of the two Armenian churches in Baku to survive the Soviet anti-religious campaign and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the 1990 pogrom and expulsion of Baku Armenians when it was looted. It is now the only standing Armenian monument in Baku. Early history The church was built between 1863 and 1869 by the design of Karl Hippius, a Baltic German architect.[5] The cornerstone was consecrated by vardapet Daniel Shahnazariants, the bishop of the diocese of Shamakhi, in June 1863. The construction was funded by Javad Melikiants (Melikov), a Baku-based Armenian philanthropist and founder of the city's first paraffin plant. The church was consecrated on May 4, 1869, by archbishop Andreas Andreasian. The Armenian Philanthropic Society of Baku founded a girls' school in 1866 and a library in 1870 next to the church.[3] In 1903 the Russian government's decision to confiscate the properties of the Armenian church were widely opposed by Armenians. The church was the site of a clash between Russian Cossack soldiers and Armenian nationalist activists on September 2, 1903. A group of armed activists affiliated with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaks), led by Nikol Duman defended the church. The confrontation turned violent by night and resulted in 11 deaths and 45 injuries on the Armenian side. On September 15, 1918, the church was attacked and looted by the invading Ottoman forces in the aftermath of the Battle of Baku. On June 11, 1919, Ottoman-Azerbaijani forces sieged the church and conducted a search. After not finding any arms inside, the soldiers shot at the walls of the church. In 1920 it became the cathedral of the Armenian Apostolic Diocese of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.[8] It survived through the Soviet state atheist policies of the 1920s and 1930s when all but two Armenian churches in Baku were destroyed.[8] The church was reopened in 1945 and became the seat of the diocese of Azerbaijan.[8] In the 1950s, the church underwest restoration and by 1956 five priests and ministers served at the cathedral. It had a choir,[9] which was composed of 25 people in 1970, when they visited Etchmiadzin.[10] 1990 pogrom and aftermath The large Armenian population of Baku‚Äîaround 200,000 in the mid-1980s‚Äîwas targeted in a January 1990 pogrom during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict The city's Armenian population was forced to flee. Serious damage to the church was caused by an arson attack on December 25, 1989, but it remained standing. Vazgen I, head of the Armenian Church, wrote to Yuri Khristoradnov, the chairman of the Soviet Council for Religious Affairs, in January 1990 that ""extremist Azeri nationalists set fire to the Armenian Church in Baku on 25 December , destroying valuable ecclesiastical books, holy paintings, and all ecclesiastical clothing."" Bill Keller wrote in The New York Times in February 1990 that the church ""whose congregation has been depleted over the past two years by an emigration based on fear, is now a charred ruin. A neighbor said firefighters and the police watched without intervening as vandals destroyed the building at the beginning of the year.""Human Rights Watch wrote in 1995: ""Armenians have vanished from the streets of Baku [...] the Armenian church in Baku stand[s] empty."" Current state An August 2, 2001 decree of the cabinet of Azerbaijan listed the church as an historical and cultural monument of national importance. Thomas de Waal wrote in his 2003 book Black Garden that the church ""remains a gutted shell eleven years after it was burned in December 1989; the cross has been removed from the belfry, now used as a pool hall."" He also wrote that it remains the only visible Armenian monument in Baku Jason Thomson wrote in 2005 that it was ""transformed into a billiard hall and tea house."" The library of the church consisting of 5,000 books and manuscripts has been preserved. In 2002 the church was transferred to the Presidential Library, which is located nearby, and now houses its archive. In 2006 Azerbaijani Minister of Culture Abulfas Garayev stated that converting the church into a library is purposeful because there are not many Armenian Christians in Azerbaijan. Emil Sanamyan, fellow at the USC Institute of Armenian Studies, argues that calling it a ""presidential book depository"" is more accurate as ""library implies public access which there isn't in this case."" According to Samir Huseynov it is open to PhD students and other researchers who can get access. The Azerbaijani authorities have presented the church as proof of their tolerance of minorities, especially the Armenians. In a 2021 interview, Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev claimed the church was (truncated)",,263,"{'like_count': 125, 'comment_count': 39, 'num_users': 63181}",Armenia - An Ancient Land,,2023-10-15 23:07:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/30738583_2028694954060065_2457914881903427584_n.jpg?stp=c17.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=eYdoDL6n85kAX_FhufK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD4P4t7WFF1JJA_mLDuE_lp038o1eO9ZizLIk6E3y-Gvg&oe=657D31B5,https://www.facebook.com/groups/401527916682645/permalink/2585163328319082,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391730239_338697872037070_4594981663234752171_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=zsh9h0Ou2nMAX8JXlUj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB1VlIkphx8MqpjYlHfRSuqvPJNMAYJin4LBCXxGuvUuA&oe=65315FE5

LH messaging indicates that the group will conduct additional attacks against Israeli forces in the coming days. Iran and elements of its Axis of Resistance are messaging that the Hamas-Israel war could expand geographically into a multi-front conflict. CTP-ISW is closely monitoring the situation to forecast whether such a scenario is becoming more or less likely.

facebook,"Messages/Letters to TFN: From & by Modou Mboob ""The protracted and heart-wrenching conflict between Israel and Palestine will forever persist until the Islamic Nations, the American Government and other relevant stakeholders are willing to change their approach. The sooner global superpowers acknowledge that wars are not the solution in any situation the better. ""The U.S. the leading global superpower is in a position to employ diplomacy to ensure every ongoing war is brought to a halt, but unfortunately, instead of negotiating, they invest billions in supporting one side of the parties to the conflict. This will never ever solve the problem! This is not what the founding fathers of DEMOCRACY envisioned and they'll be really disappointed if they were to come back just to see what's going on around the globe today. One must not use force to end conflicts, it only aggravates the situation. Put on your diplomatic shoes and pay a visit to countries going through war and call for an immediate cease-fire!!! This will work in attaining peace. ""Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey, just to name a few - you're in a better position to take pragmatic steps in leading the negotiations to end the war between Israel and Palestine. Your Muslim brothers and sisters are being unjustifiably killed every single day and yet they feel helpless from Islamic Nations that could intervene peacefully and diplomatically to alleviate the suffering of the innocent victims, especially children and other civilians. Is this how Allah instructed us to protect and defend the Islamic Ummah? A Muslim life taken every single day constitutes a reduction of the Ummah and this is concerning! I call on all other governments including that of The Gambia to officially condemn the bloodshed occasioned against the Palestinians. ""The UN, AU, OIC and other global bodies, do you think you're doing your best in ending global wars? Something must not be right somewhere. Until we are all ready to genuinely promote peace and frawn against injustice by speaking the truth to global superpowers, especially the United States, we'll forever engulfed in unending conflicts.

facebook,"Hi everyone. I thought I‚Äôd compile together as much as I could on Glorfindel, as one of the mightiest of Elves, and unique in that not only had he returned to Middle Earth from Valinor, he was also active in all the Three Ages of Middle Earth and possibly well into the Fourth Age too. Glorfindel also known as Laurefindel√´ in the Quenya tongue meaning ‚ÄúGolden haired‚Äù was one of the mightiest and valiant of all the Elves. He was born sometime during the Years of the Trees in Valinor and there is nothing known of his parentage except that he had kinship with Turgon. It is this and his allegiance to Turgon that compelled him to cross the Helcarax√´ to exile in Middle Earth, even though in his heart he was against leaving Aman and so took no part in the Kinslaying. Once entering Middle Earth he like other followers of Turgon settled in Vinyamar in Nevrast in West Beleriand just on the slopes of Mount Taras. While conflict continued with Morgoth‚Äôs armies it was after the Dagor Aglareb, the third battle of Beleriand in F.A. 60 that Turgon‚Äôs thoughts were drawn back to Tumladen Vale where Ulmo had guided him a decade earlier, and it was here in this very place that he built the Hidden City of Gondolin reaching completion in the year 116 of the First Age. Glorfindel who had always been loyal to Turgon was awarded chief of the House of the Golden Flower, one of the great noble houses of Gondolin, whose shields bore a rayed sun. His raiment was embroidered with Golden threads, decorated with Celandine and he became beloved by all the Gondolindrim. Having not participated in the previous battles, Gondolin within the hidden valley remained safe. However in F.A. 472 Glorfindel followed Turgon into battle at the plain of Anfauglith and upon the Fen of Serech to fight at the terrible and devastating Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where upon the battlefield waiting for their chance to act they finally broke through the lines of Orcs and met with the guard of Fingon, just before Morgoth was to unleash the full might of Angband upon them, including that of Glaurung. During the fight Glaurung became sorely wounded by Azagh√¢l the leader of the Dwarves of Belegost but was slain in the process forcing their army to leave the battlefield. This did not help Fingon and Turgon on the Western side so the battle went sour and the alliance was failing. Turgon‚Äôs and Fingon‚Äôs forces thus retreated to the Pass of Sirion with Glorfindel and Ecthelion both at the rear but they were set upon by Gothmog who fought Fingon in single combat. However another Balrog came and bound Fingon with his whip so he couldn‚Äôt move and so Fingon, elder brother of Turgon died by Gothmog‚Äôs black axe. Turgon and his host were now in trouble but if not for H√∫rin‚Äôs bravery and sacrifice this day enabling Turgon and his followers to flee back to Gondolin which still remained hidden from Morgoth, all would have been lost. Not much is written here of Glorfindel in this battle but I‚Äôm sure his sword and dirk counted towards many Orc deaths this day. For 38 years Gondolin remained safe but inner turmoils and dark deeds where upon Maeglin, having been captured by Morgoth, tortured and promised to have both the city and Idril who he secretly loved, gave away the city‚Äôs secret location. So it was in the year 510 Morgoth attacked Gondolin. Glorfindel was ordered to defend the Great Market area on the Eastern side of the city from advancing Orcs. His plan was to flank this invading army but he and his guard became ambushed. Surrounded by Orcs led by Balrogs they fought for hours until a fire-drake came at them and they had no choice but to retreat with the few survivors they had left. This dragon levelled this entire area with flame burning everything, all of its stores and wears. Turgon sent forth his Host of the Harp to help them but instead their leader Salgant in his cowardice led his men to the Lesser Market where he lived. There his soldiers started to fret and feared for Glorfindel‚Äôs safety, so they abandoned their leader. They arrived to aid Glorfindel in time but many of them perished within the fires that engulfed this area. Arriving at the city‚Äôs centre, The Square of the Palace, where great fountains had been built here to add to the beauty of this part of the city, they took refuge. Ecthelion who was Warden of the Great Gate was wounded and Galdor, Lord of the Folk of the Tree, was still engaged in battle which had enabled Tuor to bring Ecthelion here and Egalmoth, Lord of the Heavenly Arch had still to arrive. Glorfindel thus joined Tuor in defending the Square. They fought valiantly but could not prevent the Dragon that came upon them, breaking through their line of defence followed by Orcs and Balrogs including among this dark host, Gothmog. Ecthelion although wounded fought this threat so the others may find time to escape and in so doing killed Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, but in the process he too was slain. Turgon ordered those that survived to follow Tuor (truncated)",,239,"{'like_count': 142, 'comment_count': 36, 'num_users': 26954}",The Silmarillion/The Fall of N√∫menor/The Lord of the Rings,,2023-10-15 18:06:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/301805148_117992191012612_3235055088253290052_n.jpg?stp=c13.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EnI33LuOx8MAX_sQoMy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDqgVBKLjPuCA8aOx7IGBXgN2CNZqGLQf1ivfRRUrZFXg&oe=655A0943,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1004093603615197/permalink/1255575468467008,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392879430_10160092825173657_8384083062575433889_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rgJ3m6ONjCIAX8YWgvs&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC0q0OTK_aMF7JHp02auVHi2Db6fj1KOjmtHjtvb0Cxwg&oe=653A6FDB
facebook,"Too many Christian churches promote white Christian nationalism over and against the teachings of Jesus. In a time of war and conflict, the pastors in these churches fail to see the image of God in either neighbors or strangers. ‚ÄúThe whole concept of the imago Dei, as it is expressed in Latin, the ‚Äòimage of God,‚Äô is the idea that all men have something within them that God injected. Not that they have substantial unity with God, but that every man has a capacity to have fellowship with God. And this gives him a uniqueness, it gives him worth, it gives him dignity. And we must never forget this as a nation: there are not gradations in the image of God‚Ä¶ We will know one day that God made us to live together as brothers and to respect the dignity and worth of every man.‚Äù - The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Jews are created in the image of God. Palestinians are created in the image of God. Both are of sacred worth, and both have a right to live free from fear, terror, and oppression. If we cannot see that, we are blind. Peace be with you.

facebook,"AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION - Kenzo von Kempfeld Kenzo von Kempfeld is a beautiful 2-3 year old German Shepherd. This boy is thriving and is looking to make even more paw steps forward with training and guidance. He learns so much so quickly, having mastered ‚Äúpaw‚Äù and ‚Äúdown‚Äù in addition to ‚Äúsit‚Äù and walking beautifully on a leash. He craves work and, if he was a person, would love Mondays and always stay late at the office. However, this extra-large boy does know how to use his time off. He adores being pet and lying by your feet. At the rescue, he sometimes hangs out in the office and mostly lounges on his bed. Kenzo has an affinity for squeaky toys and treats given with an open palm. He‚Äôs not so much a fan of pushy male dogs or of cats. Ever a cool dude, he prefers to avoid conflict, spending playgroups greeting, mingling and hoping for a treat (or four). This medium/high-energy boy is bound to be the star of obedience classes and chill movie nights. His dreams are even bigger than his ears ‚Äî make his dreams come true and come by to shake his paw hello. https://sheprescue.org/Kenzo%20von%20Kempfeld.html With an approved application, you can meet Kenzo at the rescue on adoption days.

facebook,"God Intervenes in Armageddon, October 15
A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Jeremiah 25:31. Mar 296.1
For six thousand years the great controversy has been in progress; the Son of God and His heavenly messengers have been in conflict with the power of the evil one, to warn, enlighten, and save the children of men. Now all have made their decisions; the wicked have fully united with Satan in his warfare against God. The time has come for God to vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law. Now the controversy is not alone with Satan, but with men. ‚ÄúThe Lord hath a controversy with the nations‚Äù; ‚ÄúHe will give them that are wicked to the sword.‚Äù Mar 296.2
The mark of deliverance has been set upon those ‚Äúthat sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done.‚Äù Now the angel of death goes forth, represented in Ezekiel‚Äôs vision by the men with the slaughtering weapons, to whom the command is given: ‚ÄúSlay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary.‚Äù Says the prophet: ‚ÄúThey began at the ancient men which were before the house.‚Äù Ezekiel 9:1-6. The work of destruction begins among those who have professed to be the spiritual guardians of the people. The false watchmen are the first to fall. There are none to pity or to spare. Men, women, maidens, and little children perish together. Mar 296.3
‚ÄúThe Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.‚Äù Isaiah 26:21.... In the mad strife of their own fierce passions, and by the awful outpouring of God‚Äôs unmingled wrath, fall the wicked inhabitants of the earth‚Äîpriests, rulers, and people, rich and poor, high and low. ‚ÄúAnd the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried.‚Äù Jeremiah 25:33.

The event was attended by 225 qualified former rebels who were endorsed by Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (ECLIP) South Cotabato. The FRs received a P20,000 livelihood settlement grant from DSWD's Sustainable Livelihood Program, which they can use as start-up capital. The summit was made possible through the partnership of DSWD XII, ECLIP South Cotabato, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Municipal and Provincial Task Force ELCAC, and other agencies such as DOLE, TESDA, DepEd-ALS, provincial population and agriculture offices. One of the FRs from Lake Sebu expressed her gratitude, ""Nagpapasalamat kami sa kabutihan ng ating gobyerno. Kaya tayong mga dating rebelde, lagi nating tatandaan ito, at ingatan ang ibinigay sa ating pag-asa para sa ating pamilya."" The program provides livelihood to conflict-affected and vulnerable areas as a contribution to Executive Order No. 70, which seeks to institutionalize the Whole-of-Nation Approach.

When you are not empowered you will be limited. Unforgiveness creates conflict and hindrance between you and God, it also destroys the relationship between you and God. unforgiveness pitches you against your helpers. Forgiveness is the master key to a life of power. The sign that somebody knows God is that they forgive quickly. Every time you ask God for mercy, He tells you to forgive first. Unforgiveness causes grace failure and it will hurt you much more than the devil ever will. Unforgiveness makes you suffer disgrace in the midst of grace. If you can‚Äôt forgive, it shows you don‚Äôt know God because Christianity is built on forgiveness. Unforgiveness wastes offerings and sacrifices and empowers poverty. Unforgiveness blocks your access to financial favour. Unforgiven conflicts between one another lead to conflicts between you and God. Nobody prospers with bitterness and nobody is worth hating. Unforgiveness blocks your eyes to anything good in someone. You have goodwill for someone, willing to see and reconcile with the person, never gossiping or recounting their offence, never publicising the issue again, showing kindness, and thinking and speaking positively about the person who offended you are all signs of forgiveness. When you continue doing and living the way you used to do, and are never cold towards the person, it shows that you have truly forgiven them. #TMPService #PowerForTotalRestoration #DoubleRestoration #October2023 #OpenHeaven",,197,"{'like_count': 146, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 45239}",The Master's Place Int'l Church,,2023-10-15 10:12:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/327573641_905439170635774_8593076786928753403_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=sbYLFBneoJ8AX-09vad&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCLMkgnl6wi-b9kIOGzQenmjvKZlWCOic7rKoraB5IU0w&oe=655ACBC0,https://www.facebook.com/100081757633361/posts/308079361927316,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387873240_308076771927575_1029523067272764939_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3QY5lGYOLfIAX9ex2aI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDdDe9V5vwUm9ylDQtleLe8bsvHJ4UfGV1vonpS5EDGWw&oe=6530F06E

facebook,"In 1963, Indonesia invaded West Papua, the western half of the island of New Guinea. Both countries were once colonized by the Netherlands. The United States brokered a deal with the Dutch and the UN to hand over West Papua to Indonesia. This deal was made due to Cold War politics and absent consultation with West Papuans. In 1969, Indonesia and the UN oversaw the rigged Act of Free Choice ‚Äúreferendum‚Äù in which 1000 selected ‚Äúrepresentatives‚Äù voted to formalize Indonesian rule. The ‚Äúrepresentatives‚Äù were threatened with death if they opposed annexation by Indonesia. West Papuans call the ‚Äúreferendum‚Äù the ‚ÄúAct of No Choice.‚Äù West Papua is rich in natural resources. It is home to one of the biggest gold and copper mines in the world. The Grasberg mine, partly owned by American mining company Freeport McMoRan, has caused grave environmental damage. Indonesian security forces respond with violence to any opposition to the mine‚Äôs operation and other ‚Äúeconomic development‚Äù projects. Due to migration from Java and other parts of Indonesia, 50% of the West Papuan population is now non-Indigenous. Non-Papuans dominate the local economy and politics. Indonesia expropriates and exploits West Papuan land. Mining, deforestation, and internal colonization have led to West Papuans losing their land, traditional livelihoods, and autonomy. There is strong support for the Free Papua Movement (OPM). However, support for West Papuan independence is criminalized under Indonesian law. The Indonesian government has designated the OPM and other separatists as ‚Äúterrorists,‚Äù and has increased its military presence in West Papua. Since 1969, the Indonesian military has committed genocide against West Papuans. It is estimated that the military has killed up to 500,000 West Papuans since their war for independencebegan. The Indonesian army commits systematic atrocities against West Papuans that amount to genocide. They include massacres, torture, sexual assault, and detention of political prisoners. In April 2021, the West Papua Liberation Army killed an Indonesian general. Between April and November 2021, Indonesian forces carried out systematic extrajudicial killings and torture. It forcibly displaced at least 5,000 West Papuans. The UN has reported that since 2018 the number of internally displaced Papuans has grown to 60,000 to 100,000 people. The Indonesian government severely restricts journalists‚Äô and human rights workers‚Äô access to West Papua. In 2020, Indonesia passed a law to restrict internet services and to authorize arrests of journalists for publishing ‚Äúprohibited content.‚Äù Indonesia controls the narrative of conflict in West Papua. It portrays separatists as criminal terrorists to justify its military‚Äôs genocidal campaign. The UN has reported that Indonesian authorities obstruct the delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced Papuans.

facebook,"Ministering: Pst. Korede Komaiya Message Title: Power For Total Restoration(Pt. III) Message Text: Isaiah 61:7(NKJV) Without empowerment, you are powerless as a Christian. Unforgiveness is the authentic evidence that you aren't growing as a Christian and that you lack God. When you know how to initiate forgiveness, you know God. A forgiving person has the power to enforce effortless dominion in their life. Anywhere there is unforgiveness, God‚Äôs power is blocked. Unforgiveness is the diffusion of negative energy in the life of a believer. Love overlooks errors, wrongs, and mistakes. If you want the power of God to flow in your life, you must walk in forgiveness. Unforgiveness blinds your mind from anything good. Unforgiveness blocks prayers from being answered, closes your heaven, brings your sin to remembrance, and brings conflict between you and God. If you want to see the weakness of satan, forgive. Forgiveness is a choice. You can‚Äôt be bitter and have a better life. When you judge people for their errors, you are killing them. How you treat people that offend you, shows who you are with God. Unforgiveness hands you over to tormentors. #TMPService #PowerForTotalRestoration #DoubleRestoration #October2023 #OpenHeaven",,191,"{'like_count': 148, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 45239}",The Master's Place Int'l Church,,2023-10-15 12:41:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/327573641_905439170635774_8593076786928753403_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=sbYLFBneoJ8AX-09vad&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCLMkgnl6wi-b9kIOGzQenmjvKZlWCOic7rKoraB5IU0w&oe=655ACBC0,https://www.facebook.com/100081757633361/posts/308165718585347,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387875287_308164935252092_7398497163119514052_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xH_KYIddqGQAX9UYlV9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAVhkm2L9-gPu3NNGB_DyOoeyj84_lEsk3U0wIspGe0Nw&oe=6530A0CC

facebook,"Too many Christian churches promote white Christian nationalism over and against the teachings of Jesus. In a time of war and conflict, the pastors in these churches fail to see the image of God in either neighbors or strangers. 

‚ÄúThe whole concept of the imago Dei, as it is expressed in Latin, the ‚Äòimage of God,‚Äô is the idea that all men have something within them that God injected.  Not that they have substantial unity with God, but that every man has a capacity to have fellowship with God.  And this gives him a uniqueness, it gives him worth, it gives him dignity.  And we must never forget this as a nation: there are not gradations in the image of God‚Ä¶  We will know one day that God made us to live together as brothers and to respect the dignity and worth of every man.‚Äù - The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Jews are created in the image of God. Palestinians are created in the image of God. Both are of sacred worth, and both have a right to live free from fear, terror, and oppression. If we cannot see that, we are blind.

Peace be with you.

Biden's handling of the conflict as well as a range of other issues, according to the poll, a warning sign for him as he launches his bid for reelection. https://abcnews.visitlink.me/q-1qyE:=:https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/americans-favor-continued-support-israel-sour-bidens-performance/story?id=103969016",,185,"{'like_count': 68, 'comment_count': 88, 'num_users': 2902303}",World News Now,,2023-10-15 19:36:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/347634342_655553566603178_2493118442858683240_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fJIUCeP_45wAX9uZ1kD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCt55IztXT9Nzc1PaoOpW0MZjhWfkfegYX1dnGGjM4GYA&oe=655AA7D6,https://www.facebook.com/100064456223286/posts/722095319949002,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391729114_714596833860533_1975324945961032478_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rLeT5yBzAQ4AX8R6IEV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCUNBNS8P6OUUC_rvv8XuoOnwQ848lA29Y8OTNq_I-Yjw&oe=653A078E
facebook,"I have today asked the Clergy to pray for peace in the country and the world at large.While attending a Church Service at St. Francis of Assisi, Chwele Sub-Parish Catholic Church in Kabuchai constituency, where I presided over a fundraising event for a church construction project, I have this morning expressed my concerns about the potential global impact of the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel which could affect Kenya's cost of living. Global peace is paramount for constructive development. I therefore, appeal to world leaders to intervene and put an end to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. I hence urge both parties to seek an amicable solution and respect human rights in their pursuit of peace. As a leader and a former Kenyan foreign affairs minister, I am deeply concerned about the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. We call upon the combatants to lay down their arms, engage in dialogue within the framework of international multilateral bodies like the United Nations, and work towards global peace. We are observing a ticking time bomb that could spread to other parts of the world, with potential repercussions for Kenya and beyond, including the rise of other organized groups causing havoc. I commend the progress in the ongoing bipartisan talks at the Bomas of Kenya and await to receive the report in Parliament and proceed according to the decisions reached by Members of Parliament. Hon. Catherine Wambilianga, the County MP for Bungoma County, is representing the Ford Kenya Party at the talks and we are assured of her confidence in airing the views of the party. As we approach the examination season, I ask the church to pray for our children and ask for support for all candidate for optimal performance in their examinations. I also ask stakeholders in the education sector to ensure fairness during the assessment process, allowing deserving students to receive their well-earned results. I am happy and looking forward for the construction of a modern referral hospital in the Sichei area which will enhance healthcare services and provide educational opportunities for institutions like Kibabii University, as well as create job opportunities.

facebook,"It's 38 years since the release of ‚ÄòLive After Death‚Äô.

#LiveAfterDeath is Iron Maiden's first live album since the 1981 Maiden Japan EP. Most critics agree that Live After Death is one of the best live metal albums of all time. Maiden has always been a ""live"" band whose power and energy seemed to come really alive on stage, and this power and energy virtually explodes out of the album. The mixing is absolutely superb. Murray's guitar is on the left and Smith's on the right, and each can be clearly and distinctly heard but at the same time they both seem to blend together and complement each other. This album must definitely be experienced with good headphones! 

The concert intro, with the sounds of aircraft engines and the voice of Churchill, fits perfectly well to the first song of the set. 'Aces High' is a song about the battle of Britain and Churchill's speech was pronounced on 4th June 1940, at the beginning of the conflict, encouraging British resistance in the face of a potential Nazi invasion after the rout experienced by the British and French troops at the Battle of Dunkirk (26 May ‚Äì 3 June, 1940). 

Live After Death was released as a double-LP, which was too long to fit on a single CD. Consequently, the last five tracks ('Wrathchild', 'Children Of The Damned', '22 Acacia Avenue', 'Die With Your Boots On', and 'Phantom Of The Opera') were not included on the original CD release. This was a major complaint. Those live versions are rare and brilliant, and should have been included, even if it meant a double-CD. At the very least, the extra tracks should have been released as a bonus disc. 

The mistake was eventually corrected. Live After Death was re-released in September 1998 as a double-CD, and the second CD contained the five missing tracks from the Hammersmith show. Also, the gaps between some of the songs that previously existed have been smoothed out with crowd noise, improving the album's sense of continuity. And finally, the 'Churchill's Speech' intro is a separate track on this re-release. 

A little piece of trivia: many Maiden fans are a bit too young to know this ‚Äì or are not familiar with British culture ‚Äì but when Bruce, just before 'Revelations', says, ""Nice to see you, to see you is nice"", he's actually quoting another Bruce ‚Äì Bruce Forsyth, a British TV entertainer famous for his catchphrases. Forsyth was hosting The Generation Game in the 1970s and was known for saying this particular sentence at the beginning of the show.

facebook,"Greetings from Washington, D.C. I‚Äôm still coming down from a high from last night after hearing Joe Biden address the crowd at the Human Rights Campaign annual gala dinner, as we chanted, ‚ÄúFour more years!‚Äù His has been the most pro-LGBTQ+ administration in the history of our country, and we were proud to endorse Biden/Harris for 2024 and to continue our work to see this equality-focused administration return for another term.

One moment that struck me in particular was when President Biden tied in what is going on in the larger world to what is going on here at home:

‚ÄúFolks, we have to reject hate in every form. Because history has taught us again and again, antisemitism, islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, they‚Äôre all connected. Hate toward one group left unanswered opens the door for more hate toward more groups, more often, readily.‚Äù

I have these powerful words in mind as I look ahead with great trepidation and heartbreak over what is unfolding in the Middle East.

**Israel prepares for a ground invasion of Gaza

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured the front lines near Gaza and stated that the Israel Defense Forces were ready to commence a major ground operation at any moment. The visit follows days of aerial bombardments of Gaza to destroy Hamas positions and soften up their defenses in advance of the imminent ground invasion. The attacks and planned ground war are in response to the bloodiest terror attack and mass killing of Jews since the Holocaust, with Israel losing more than 1,300 citizens, and over a hundred kidnapped and taken into Gaza as hostages.

Israel issued an evacuation notice for more than one million Palestinians in the north region of Gaza, which has been without food, water or electricity for many days. As thousands of desperate families stream south, human rights groups have decried the evacuation notice, which they say amounts to a logistically impossible scenario resulting in massive civilian displacement and a humanitarian crisis. Per the New York Times, over 2,300 people in Gaza have been killed in the past week. Hospitals are already overrun with the injured, which include nearly a thousand children. Gaza‚Äôs Health Ministry will not evacuate hospitals, noting that doing so would confer a death sentence on the wounded. ‚ÄúOur moral position obliges us to continue working,‚Äù the ministry stated.

The initial unqualified support by its allies in Europe and the U.S. for Israel‚Äôs right to act in self-defense is now tempered by criticism that the retaliatory attacks have become ‚Äúindiscriminate attacks against civilians,‚Äù according to the president of the European Council. Over the weekend, President Biden stated, while reiterating that the U.S. stands with Israel, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and the appalling attacks.‚Äù

**The conflict threatens to spread

Iran told Israel on Saturday that it does not wish further escalation of the conflict, but also declared that it will have to intervene if the operation in Gaza continues. This would expand the war from a conflict between Hamas and Israel to a broader regional conflict that could open another front should Hezbollah (which is backed by Iran) or any Syrian-backed militant groups join the fighting. Specifically, Iran warned that if Israel follows through with its planned ground invasion, Iran will have to respond.

The U.S. has been warning other countries and groups not to take advantage of the situation and expand the war to a regional one. It has sent aircraft carrier groups to the region as a show of force.

**The U.S. remains without key leadership

Amid the crisis, the U.S. House of Representatives remains without a speaker after Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), an extreme MAGA ally of ex-president Trump, won his party‚Äôs nomination by secret ballot but not by a margin big enough to seal the deal. There is a faction of less-extreme Republicans, numbering in the dozens, who may refuse to elevate someone as radical and controversial as Jordan to Speaker, fearing voter reprisals in their more moderate, purple districts next November.

Jordan‚Äôs strategy appears to be to mount a pressure campaign against the holdouts, naming, shaming and blaming them for their failure to back him. It is unclear how effective this strategy will be. Indeed, it may backfire should the more moderate members push back against the strong arm tactics.

Meanwhile, paralysis in the Senate, due to holds on military and diplomatic appointments and promotions placed mainly by Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), continues to leave the U.S. without key leadership in the Middle East, both from the State Department and the Pentagon. Analysts have begun to warn that the terrorism that struck Israel was aided in part by political divisions there, and that the lack of U.S. preparedness might encourage similar terrorist opportunism.

facebook,"#OTD in 1951, the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge concluded, marking the end of a grueling month-long conflict during the Korean War. Spanning from September 13th to October 15th, this battle unfolded along a winding front line running east to west, a few miles north of the 38th parallel, through the heart of the Korean peninsula. UN and communist forces, engaged in a series of intense and bloody clashes as they jockeyed for control of the twisting terrain. After a relentless 30 days of combat, American and French forces ultimately gained the upper hand, successfully securing Heartbreak Ridge. However, this achievement came at a considerable cost. Despite their triumph, Sherman tanks struggled to advance through the treacherous Mundung-ni Valley, with 38 armored vehicles destroyed and nine damaged in the process. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, with over 3,700 American and French soldiers lost and an estimated 25,000 North Korean and Chinese casualties. The profound impact of these losses resonated deeply with the UN and US command, leading to a strategic shift. They recognized that battles like Heartbreak Ridge, though significant, often came at too high a human toll for the relatively modest territorial gains achieved. This realization prompted a shift toward more cautious and deliberate tactics involving air support, artillery, and infantry, culminating in the eventual capture of Heartbreak Ridge in October 1951. In the first image, taken September 18, 1951, US troops display signs left by Chinese soldiers. #KoreanWar #HeartbreakRidge #MilitaryHistory",,176,"{'like_count': 133, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 1930214}",Nine Line Apparel,,2023-10-15 13:02:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/324348629_1025197684970375_2721727125676332522_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=WhpK8qjiAdkAX9Gi9VI&_nc_oc=AQmUQdyjQE_oLv5P8_XKyjD_THQMypaaXjuz62A3DQ3VjZk8IndjiTCizZ7z63lsYc8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBf3-s6KBgPfTPtax4RJGv56f0UxvXL1CAWan6dxIn_fA&oe=655B9658,https://www.facebook.com/100064815485718/posts/739255364911640,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392744921_739254741578369_2376469869390353656_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cD4ahhV5LoIAX9oApIW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAPjAtc-O8nTi0m0XeaX1UpiXc_HbFfGQ9i-6bRlR5GzA&oe=655ADCE2

President Biden updated Prime Minister Netanyahu on U.S. military support and reiterated his warning against anyone seeking to expand the conflict. President Biden discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu U.S. coordination with the United Nations, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, and others in the region to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food, and medical care. President Biden affirmed his support for all efforts to protect civilians. As more information comes to light about Hamas‚Äôs brutal atrocities committed over the past week, President Biden reiterated the need for all countries to unequivocally condemn Hamas as a terrorist organization that does not represent the aspirations of the Palestinian people. https://eg.usembassy.gov/readout-of-president-bidens-call-with-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel/",,176,"{'like_count': 16, 'comment_count': 95, 'num_users': 1293021}",U.S. Embassy Cairo,,2023-10-15 08:08:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/196306670_145352477637736_867538713209543245_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=FmEE8U5z3IQAX-q-oaC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfACy1Y16lsPOlH3q21n9X4bxTOoNu5f60bro8L_xgellw&oe=657D48E9,https://www.facebook.com/100064889524189/posts/707125631460415,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/9973210563150655398?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2v9ipibika81v.cloudfront.net%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F156%2F2015%2F12%2Fdefault-blog-seal.png&fb_obo=1&utld=cloudfront.net&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbEgRNeFqPIZF2BnfHAx0I0KSKne8BYTEnAugkrUhFrx-g&oe=652D4981

facebook,"SHORELINE DRIVE AND AQUARIUM WAY Contact: Media Relations Detail (562) 570-5273 LBPDMediaRelations@longbeach.gov Homicide detectives have arrested a driver responsible for a fatal traffic collision that occurred on October 14, 2023, which is believed to be intentional. At this time, there is no indication this incident is an act of terror or connected to any international events. At approximately 6:34 p.m., officers responded to Shoreline Drive and Aquarium Way regarding an injury traffic collision involving multiple vehicles and pedestrians. Upon arrival, officers found a female pedestrian down in the roadway who appeared to have been struck by a vehicle. Officers rendered medical aid to the victim until the arrival of the Long Beach Fire Department who continued aid and subsequently determined her deceased at the scene. Additional people sustained injuries as a result of the collision and were transported to local hospitals for treatment; they are in stable condition. During the preliminary investigation, officers discovered evidence leading them to believe the collision was possibly intentional. As a result, Homicide and Collision Investigations detectives responded to the scene of the collision. Detectives determined the suspect, driving a Chevrolet Bolt, was traveling eastbound in the westbound lanes of Shoreline Drive at Aquarium Way at a high rate of speed when he drove through a red light and struck the pedestrians and multiple occupied vehicles, without slowing. Due to the suspicious circumstances of the incident and current international events, the Federal Bureau of Investigation responded to the scene. At this time, there is no indication that this incident was an act of terror nor associated with the current violence in Israel; however, the investigation is ongoing. ‚ÄúOn behalf of the Long Beach Police Department, I offer my deepest condolences to the family of Romelia Aguilar for their loss,‚Äù said Chief of Police Wally Hebeish. ‚ÄúThe violence and acts of terror abroad have generated concern and anxiety throughout our community, and this apparent act of violence has only added to that anxiety. The immediate response by our officers, detectives, and partners from the FBI has been instrumental in this investigation, and while there is no evidence indicating a nexus to the current conflict in the Middle East, we will remain vigilant as we continue investigating every aspect of this crime.‚Äù The suspect remained on scene. He has been identified as Khalid Yagobbi, a 46-year-old resident of the city of Los Angeles. Yagobbi was transported to a local hospital for treatment and then transported to the Long Beach City Jail, where he was booked for murder and is being held on $2,000,000 bail. Detectives will present their case later this week to the Los Angeles County District Attorney‚Äôs office for filing consideration. At this time, the motive for the incident remains under investigation. The female pedestrian who died has been identified as Romelia Cuarenta Aguilar, a 60-year-old resident of Long Beach.",,174,"{'like_count': 28, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 28358}",Streaming562,,2023-10-15 21:35:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/305398981_503278425136994_7024685850396441973_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=JBMZQbB8UQwAX-NQSeu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBJ780uBwRQiIQAZkLhE58OQpWrYDWLCuvNtSJidItZqA&oe=6559BF68,https://www.facebook.com/100063645216492/posts/824645813000252,

A continual barrage of missiles has invoked the law of physics, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The disdainful, degrading inhuman encounters and blindsided terroristic actions have caused innocent men, women, and children to lose their lives due to others demented disgruntled thinking, driven by an agenda full of greed, disrespect, and self-indulgence. Our world is shaken and rightfully so. What is the ripple effect? When is enough, enough? Spiritual wickedness in high places is immediately pointing fingers at one another trying to place blame on each other to gain preeminence, position, and leverage for their own agenda. ¬† Uninformed accusationalists (if that is a word) are trying to bring rationalization to an ever increasing problem in our world, the world of being uniformed. This conflict that only the Prince of Peace can resolve started with the act of Abram and Sarai not listening to the promise of God. The loss of focus on the promise of God has caused a great strain on many. ¬† Many questions have arose this week due to the upheaval in Gaza. Questions only God has the answer to. Is Jesus about to come? Will this reveal the Antichrist? Will this open the door to the temple being rebuilt? All of these things could take place. ¬† In Luke 19 Jesus gives instruction in a parable of what we are to do. Occupy until He comes. Take note, Occupy is capitalized. Occupy, takeover, establish, do business, busy yourself. Prayer warrior, keep on praying. Pastor, keep on pastoring. Preacher, keep on preaching. Evangelist, keep on evangelizing.

facebook,"Subject: Important Update Regarding Group Content Policy Dear Members, We wanted to address a recent development that has required us to adjust the content policy within our group. We value the sense of community that we have built together, and we appreciate your active participation. However, we must adapt to changing circumstances and strive to maintain a respectful and neutral environment for all our members. As many of you are aware, recent events in the Israel-Palestine conflict have resulted in an escalation of tensions and violence. In light of this, we have made the difficult decision to no longer accept posts related to this area or conflict or any political discussions within the group. Our aim is to keep the community focused on our shared interests while remaining neutral in matters that may lead to division and conflict. We want to emphasize that our decision is not an endorsement of war or politics in any form. It is our commitment to promoting a safe, respectful, and inclusive space for everyone. We understand that people have diverse opinions and feelings about this issue, but we believe that our group should remain free of political discussions and the potential harm that may arise from them. Additionally, we are taking steps to enforce our content policy more rigorously. We will be actively monitoring the group to identify and remove any individuals who engage in trolling, make nasty comments, or use derogatory emojis that mock the very real suffering of all parties involved in the conflict. Our priority is to maintain a supportive and positive atmosphere within our community. We regret having to make these changes but believe they are necessary to ensure that our group remains a place where members can connect and engage in a respectful and enjoyable manner. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in these difficult times. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns regarding these updates.

facebook,"Editorial: THE ongoing conflict in Palestine has brought out the worst amongst many self-professed democrats in the West, as they have cheered on Israel‚Äôs excesses, and participated in the dehumanisation of the Palestinians. Particularly galling are efforts by the US administration to block a ceasefire and give Gaza‚Äôs besieged population a breather. When asked recently about calls for a ceasefire, the White House press secretary termed these calls ‚Äúrepugnant ‚Ä¶ and disgraceful‚Äù. Moreover, as reported in the American media, a State Department memo has advised US diplomats against using phrases such as ‚Äúrestoring calm, end to violence/ bloodshed‚Äù and ‚Äúde-escalation/ ceasefire‚Äù. From the looks of it, Washington has given Israel the green light to carry on its butchery of the Palestinian people, while drowning out calls for ending the violence. Other members of the Western fraternity are no better. France has banned pro-Palestine rallies to preserve ‚Äúpublic order‚Äù. Ironically, in the land of libert√©, egalit√© and fraternit√©, these vaunted ideals are out of bounds for Palestinians or those who sympathise with them.

facebook,"SAVE ME YOUR IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE It's super amusing that some people label me as anti-Semitic. Allow me to inform you that my two ex-boyfriends, and these are important relationships in my life, are American-Jewish who believe and preach the teachings of Judaism. They and their families are truly wonderful and peace-loving people. During our relationships, I‚Äôve wholeheartedly embraced Jewish holidays and traditions, and I even attended synagogues. My love for challah, matzoh balls, latkes, kugels, gravlax, and falafels knows no bounds. In our relationships, there was mutual respect and admiration. Let me be unequivocal: I STAND FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, regardless of whether we're talking about Israelis or Palestinians. Every single human life, in my view, DESERVES TO BE DEFENDED. If you happen to lack respect for individual human life, that's your call, but please SPARE ME YOUR IGNORANCE AND YOUR PREJUDICE. I am FAR from being anti-Semitic, that I can tell you to your face. I'm fortunate to have Jewish friends who advocate for a ceasefire and oppose the invasion of Gaza. They recognize that Gazan civilians, WHO ARE DISTINCT FROM HAMAS, deserve protection under international law and human rights. I completely 100% agree. I urge those with a platform to speak up regarding the Israel-Palestinian conflict and call for an IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Please appeal to our government and other nations to facilitate communication and peaceful negotiations among the involved parties.

facebook,"PALESTINE üáµüá∏(summary) -Ang Palestine ay lugar ng mga Propeta. -Walang karapatan ang mga hudyo sa Palestine -Ang puno‚Äôt dulo ng pangyayari -Ang Palestine ay para sa mga Palestino -Ang Jerusalem ay kapitolyo ng Palestine -Walang bansang Israel Ilan sa mga Propeta na nanirahan dito ay si: Ibrahim(Abraham),Lut(Lot),Ismael(Ismail),Ishaaq(Isaac),Ya‚Äôqoob(Jacob),Yusof(Joseph),Daud(David),Sulaiman(Solomon),Zakariyyah(Zacarias),Yahya(John). {May the peace and blessing be upon them} Si Ibrahim ang anak nya ay dalawa: 1.Si Ismael 2.Si Isaac Ang anak ni Isaac ay si Jacob(Ya‚Äôqoob) kung saan ang karamihan sa mga Propeta ay nagmula sa kanyang angkan tulad ni Yusof(Joseph),Daud(David),Sulaiman(Solomon),Zakariyyah(Zacarias),Musa(Moses) at Yahya(John). Ang pangalawang pangalan ni Ya‚ÄôQoob ay ISRAEL kaya tinatawag ang kanyang mga angkan na BANU ISRAEL(Son‚Äôs of Israel). Ngunit,nakilala na ang angkan ni Israel sa pagsuway at katigasan ng ulo kung saan sila ang kumakalaban at pumapatay sa mismong mga Propeta na ipinadala sakanila maliban sa kakaunting bilang na mga nanamapalataya sakanila kasama ang mga Propeta,ganito ang pagdescribe ng Quran sakanila. Kabilang sa kanilang pagsuway ay: -Sinuway nila si Propeta Solaiman(Solomon) -Sinuway nila si Propeta Musa(Moses) -Sinuway nila si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) -Sila ang pumatay kay Propeta Yahya(John) -Sila ang pumatay kay Propeta Zacariah(Zacarias). KAYA PINARUSAHAN SILA NG ALLAH KUNG SAAN ANG NAGING PARUSA NILA AY WALA SILANG LUPA SA MUNDONG ITO MALIBAN SA MGA NANANAMPALATAYA SAKANILA. Ang nangyari sakanila sa loob ng ilang siglo ay kung saan-saan sila napadpad sa middles east pagkatapos ng panahon ni Propeta Eisa(Jesus). Ang iba ay napunta sa Europe at America. Sa World War II sa pagitan ng taon 1941 at 1945 ay nangyari ang Holocaust kung saan namatay ang halos 6 millions na hudyo sa Europa sa kamay ni Adolf Hitler ng Germany. Ang dahilan ng malaking galit na ito ni Adolf Hitler sa mga hudyo ay tungkol sa political at religion kung saan ang paniniwala ng mga hudyo sa mga taong hindi kabilang sakanila ay mga hayop o pinakamababang nilalang,dahil nga naniniwala sila na sila nga ang chosen people na pinili ng Allah. Kaya ginawa ito sakanila ni Hitler. Nagkaroon lang naman sila ng lupa sa Palestine dahil naawa ang GREAT BRITAIN sakanila kung saan nirekomenda ito sa UNITED NATIONS at agad naman ito natanggap ng UN sa taong 1947 dahil matagal din nanilbihan ang mga hudyo sa Great Britain. Sa sumunod na taon(1948) ay nagdeklara kaagad ang mga Zionist Jews ng kanilang sariling bansa sa Palestine na tinawag nilang ISRAEL kung saan parang kailan lng yung pagdating nila sa Palestine bilang mga refugees hanggang sa paunti-unti na nilang pinapalawak ang kanilang lupain sa pagsakop sa mga lupain ng mga palestino sa dahas at sapilitan na paraan. Kasabay nun ay inipon nila ang lahat ng mga hudyo sa buong mundo kung saan dati-rati ay magkakawatakwatak dahil sa parusa sakanila ng Allah. Dito na nanghimasok ang mga bansang Arabo at nagkaron ng digmaan na di matapos tapos hanggang ngayon sa pagitan ng mga JEWS at ARABS. Bukod sa conflict na ito ay di rin ginagalang ng mga jews ang mga arabo dahil naniniwala silang mga alipin lng sila kaya hindi sila naniwala kay Propeta Muhammad SAW at madali lng sakanila pumaslang ng arabong Muslim. Bakit? Si Propeta Ismael na kapatid ni Propeta Isaac ay anak ni Hajar na pangalawang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim na dating kasambahay ni Sarah na nanay naman ni Propeta Isaac na unang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim(ayun sa kanilang kasaysayan). At pagkatapos ng paghahari ng mga angkan ni Isaac kung saan ang pinaka huling Propeta sakanila ay si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) ay binigay naman ng Allah ang pangako na ito sa angkan ni Propeta Ismael kung saan magmumula sa kanyang angkan ang huling propeta at Sugo na si Propeta Muhammad SAW. Dahil nga hindi nanggaling sa angkan ni Isaac ang huling Propeta ay hindi naniwala ang mga hudyo sa paniniwalang mababa lng si Propeta Ismael kumpara sakanilang ninuno na si Propeta Isaac na anak mula sa unang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim. Bukod doon ay talagang palasuway sila sa mga Propeta kahit noon pa. Sa madaling salita,ang nangyayaring conflict sa pagitan ng Jews at Arab Muslims ay sa religion at history. Ang Palestine ay lugar ng mga arabong Muslim,at mga nanampalataya sa mga angkan ni Israel. Hindi rito kabilang ang mga sumuway. Hindi sila kabilang sa pangako ng Allah. Tatlo ang umiiral na relihiyon sa Palestine: 1.Judaism 2.Christianity 3.Islam BAKIT HINDI KABILANG ANG MGA CHRISTIANS SA PALESTINE SA KAAWAY NG MGA PALESTINONG MUSLIM? Ang mga kristiyano ay hindi tulad ng mga hudyo,kung saan mas malala ang hudyo ngunit iisang lahi lng sila. Tinuturing din ng mga hudyo na kaaway ang mga kristiyano dahil hindi naman talaga sila naniwala kay Propeta Eisa(Jesus), sila ang nagparatang kay Maria na nakagawa raw ng pangangalunya(Zinah) at si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) ay anak sa zinah kaya nangyari ang malaking himala mula sa Allah kung saan nagsalita si Propeta (truncated)",,167,"{'like_count': 37, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 47187}",ùî∏ùîπùî∏ùïêùî∏'ùï§ ùíÑùíçùíêùíîùíÜùíï,,2023-10-15 01:51:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/332010481_714049530364716_2139387054567055365_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bQi3BEdBTPoAX8W8EBB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBlAHFXclaph8FFrqZnss3Ikle1Zo6R1K9hHQBTd8qm5Q&oe=655AD3D0,https://www.facebook.com/100064001446732/posts/727126516097390,

facebook,"Mayor Releases Statement on Israel Attacks In the face of the recent terrorist attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorist group and the imminent ground attack into the West Bank, Mayor Javier Joven has issued an Executive Order denouncing these acts of terror. The Odessa City Council stands firmly against any form of terrorism and condemns all acts of antisemitism. Mayor Joven believes in the power of unity and peace, and he calls upon the people of the world to join together in solidarity against hatred. As we find ourselves on the brink of a potential global conflict, it is essential that we stand as one, promoting harmony and understanding among all nations. In this critical time, Mayor Joven encourages everyone to pray. He understands that prayer can bring solace, hope, and healing to those in need during challenging circumstances. As a symbol of his commitment to this cause, he shares the following prayer: ""Lord, make me an instrument of your peace! Where there is hate, I put love. Where there is offense, I put forgiveness. Where there is discord, let me put unity. Where there is a mistake, I put the truth. Where there is doubt, I put faith. Where there is despair, let hope arise. Where there is darkness, I put light. Where there is sadness, I put happiness."" Mayor Joven emphasizes the importance of consoling others, seeking understanding, and promoting love rather than selfish desires. He believes that by giving, forgetting, forgiving, and even embracing sacrifice, we can receive and find each other. He acknowledges the eternal life that can emerge from selfless acts, highlighting the value of resurrection amidst adversity. Finally, Mayor Joven addresses those who may be in need of prayer, acknowledging that he may not know their specific circumstances but assuring them that God does. He encourages individuals and all Pastors, Ministers, Clergy, and Congregations to pray this prayer with an open heart, believing that it can help them find what they seek. Mayor Joven stands firm in his commitment to fostering peace and unity within our city and beyond. He urges citizens to join him in praying for peace and hopes that this collective effort will inspire change, deter violence, and pave the way for a brighter, more harmonious future.",,167,"{'like_count': 76, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 57595}","City of Odessa, Texas",,2023-10-15 22:30:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/335942238_6004118939715126_808266446592773832_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yNI24UbEEW0AX8BYDc1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAZB8D7Njluh0ocLUxCDRpkcvuzJMYUZYO2ojOL_7AlaA&oe=655A0DD1,https://www.facebook.com/100069018965319/posts/659411416369485,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391625736_651106823824176_6591121575115226974_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=gk1nS4JCj2EAX8piyNs&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCbTZHGWOFPQHcWUcSWeUGSVowvYJb_8xnGZQ2Kuua8Jg&oe=6543663F

facebook,"MSNBC has quietly taken 3 of its Muslim broadcasters, with some of the deepest knowledge of the conflict, out of the anchor‚Äôs chair since the war began last Saturday. Ayman covered the conflict from Gaza for two years as the only English language reporter in the strip. The moves come as MSNBC ‚Äî like the Democratic Party with which it‚Äôs often aligned ‚Äî has swung into intense solidarity with the Jewish state after the murderous Hamas attacks. That shift has come with heated internal and external objections to anything that breaks with that solidarity, and has come with social media criticism of Hasan, Mohyeldin, and Velshi. Hasan has also been vocal on X, formerly known as Twitter, condemning the Hamas attack and calling attention to the plight of civilians in Gaza. In 2014, Mohyeldin, the network‚Äôs most experienced reporter in Gaza, was abruptly pulled from NBC‚Äôs coverage of the region and replaced by Richard Engel for several days. CNN reported at the time that NBC executives did not give him a concrete explanation beyond citing vague ‚Äúsecurity reasons.‚Äù Semafor reported that when violence erupted in Gaza in 2021, MSNBC executives had privately expressed discomfort with hosts Hasan and Mohyeldin for their coverage. Conservative media has put pressure on MSNBC to shift further toward Israel in its coverage. The criticism of the three MSNBC hosts ‚Äî three of the most high-profile Muslim on-air personalities on the network‚Äî seems vastly disproportionate to anything they‚Äôve said on air.

The cash will be given to the UN‚Äôs Relief and Works Agency flash appeal, which is working to support those being displaced by escalating violence in Gaza.The Scottish Government has pledged ¬£500,000 in humanitarian funding to the relief effort in Gaza. The cash will be given to the UN‚Äôs Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) flash appeal, which is working to support those being displaced by escalating violence in Gaza. International development minister Christina McKelvie also reiterated the Scottish Government‚Äôs call for a humanitarian corridor to allow aid to be delivered to civilians. She said: ‚ÄúOur thoughts are with all the innocent people caught in the middle of escalating conflict in Israel and Gaza. ‚ÄúThe Scottish Government reiterates the call from the First Minister and the UN secretary-general for a humanitarian corridor to be established so that urgent assistance can be given to those civilians who are trapped, helpless and cannot leave.‚Äù The call was made by First Minister Humza Yousaf earlier this week. Tamara Alrifai, the director of external relations and communications at the UNRWA, said: ‚ÄúThis generous contribution is an incredibly humane gesture towards tens of thousands of people who are in utter distress in the Gaza Strip. ‚ÄúUNRWA is very grateful for the show of support by Scotland and will use every penny to help alleviate the suffering of civilian women, children and men in Gaza.‚ÄùYousaf has also been candid about his and his wife Nadia El-Nakla‚Äôs fears for her family in Gaza. Her mother Elizabeth and father Maged made the trip last week, ahead of the Hamas attack on Israel which sparked reprisals, to visit family, becoming trapped there. In a tearful interview with Sky News on Friday, the First Minister said: ‚ÄúI do not know, I genuinely do not know if I will see my in-laws again. Nadia doesn‚Äôt know she‚Äôs going to see her mum and dad again. ‚ÄúAnd all we can do is watch the news and look at all the rolling coverage.‚Äù Yousaf also revealed that his youngest daughter, Amal, four, asked him if ‚Äúgranny would be back in time for Halloween‚Äù, and that they had told her she was ‚Äúscared of the thunder‚Äù. They told her that she would be back, but Yousaf said: ‚ÄúWe honestly don‚Äôt know if she will.‚Äù The First Minister also told the BBC he felt that the response from the Israeli Government was ‚Äúgoing too far‚Äù and punishing ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù people. His comments came after he and his wife endured a scare on Thursday after seeing the area where her family live being bombed through live media reports.Ms El-Nakla was able to reach her mother soon after to confirm they had not been hurt. In an emotional video posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday by her son-in-law, Elizabeth El-Nakla said: ‚ÄúWhere is humanity? Where‚Äôs people‚Äôs hearts in the world, to let this happen in this day and age? ‚ÄúMay God help us, goodbye.‚Äù Meanwhile, rallies have been organised across the UK in solidarity with the Palestinian people, with thousands expected to march in London. In Scotland, smaller events in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee have been organised. McKelvie also announced ¬£250,000 in humanitarian funding for Libya, through the Government‚Äôs Humanitarian Emergency Fund, to support their response to flooding that killed more than 4,000 people in September. She added: ‚ÄúMany thousands of people in Libya are also still dealing with the impact of major flooding following dam collapses in the aftermath of Storm Daniel and our thoughts are also with them and their families, as work to provide essential aid, such as food, clean water and shelter, continues in those areas worst affected.‚Äù ""NOTHING FOR ISRAELI VICTIMS"" 'The SNP Government is sending aid to Gaza... but nothing to Israeli victims of Hamas' Sammy Stein, chairman of the Glasgow Friends of Israel, says the Scottish Government must not risk stoking antisemitism by taking sides in the conflict in the Middle East A leading member of Scotland's Jewish community has called for the SNP Government to be more balanced on the war between Israel and Hamas.

facebook,"Israel vows to demolish Hamas as troops prepare to move on shattered Gaza Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to ""demolish Hamas"" as his troops prepared to move into the Gaza Strip in pursuit of Hamas militants whose deadly rampage through Israeli border towns shocked the world. Israel has urged exhausted Gazans to evacuate south, which hundreds of thousands have already done in the besieged enclave that is home to more than 2 million people. Hamas, which runs Gaza, has told people to ignore Israel's message. Inside Gaza's narrow and crowded streets, conditions were deteriorating as deaths from Israeli air strikes rose. Bodies were stored in ice cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals was too risky and cemeteries were full. With fears of the conflict spilling further, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his tour of Middle East states, seeking to prevent escalation and secure the release of 155 hostages Israel says were taken by Hamas back into Gaza. Arab leaders stressed the need to protect Gaza civilians. ""The reaction went beyond the right to self-defence, turning into collective punishment,"" said Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Israel's retaliatory strikes. Clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon, the deadliest since 2006, have underscored the dangers of regional spillover. On Sunday, Hamas' armed wing Al Qassam Brigades said it fired 20 rockets from Lebanon at two Israeli settlements while Lebanon's Hezbollah militia said it fired missiles at Israeli barracks in Hanita and had inflicted casualties. Israel said it was striking Lebanon in retaliation, and the U.N. peacekeeping force said its headquarters in south Lebanon had been hit by a rocket. Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, warned Israel of escalation if it kept attacking Palestinians. ""If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,"" said Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, adding that Tehran could not simply stay an observer.

I find it terribly hard to find words adequate to express my thoughts. But now its time to end my silence and maybe in a clumsy way, try to open up some discussion in a human and Psychoanalytic way that can try facilitate us as a Facebook psychoanalytic community in re finding our minds and thinking in all this horror. As a starting point and personally as the group admin i need to say that i feel the terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel this week are both horrendous, disturbing and unacceptable. My deepest sympathy go out to the people of Israel and many jewish communities around the world and in South Africa that already carry a deep intergenerational wound from the holocaust. These condolences also extend to some of my global friends and colleagues. I know that the Israel üáÆüá± conflict is complicated in its history, and not black and white. I feel the humanity of it is surely not as complicated. I think the starting point must be with an agreement that hurting, killing, torturing another person and child is inhumane. Condolences to those families and communities who are touched by this terrible conflict. Condolences to the civilians in Gaza who are now also caught in the crossfire and victims from the resulting war as a result of these terrorist attacks. (NOTE BEDATE ON THIS ABOVE SENTENCE IN COMMENTS, IT SEEMS MORE COMPLICATED) The images below can be disturbing. They are two photos from the children's room in Israel.

facebook,"The Israeli-Hamas war taking place is an extension of the historical Israeli-Arab conflict that has been going on for centuries that, at its core, is a conflict based in religious beliefs. While there are political, economic, cultural, and land issues at play, the basis for Israel's presence in ""Israel"", it's insistence in it's right to possess the land, and the unbending support for Israel by the US is founded in Jewish and Christian holy books. According to the Old Testament, the present day land known as Israel was given to God's people, the Israelis, in perpetuity. This was the ""promised land"" that Moses brought the Israelites to after freeing them from Egyptian slavery. The Israelites were ordered by God, according to the Bible authors, to subdue the land, conquering all of the Peoples and tribes inhabiting the land at the time. They conquered and colonized the Native peoples in 6 years and established their kingdom. The Israeli kingdom(s) were eventually conquered by others and the Israeli/Jewish people dispersed throughout the world. This changed after WWII. The Jewish people living throughout the world began to return to Israel to reclaim their promised land. They became a nation in 1948. Since then, in several wars and military actions, Israel has grown to its present shape and size... at a grave cost to the inhabitants of this land. In every case, the land was already inhabited when the Israelites arrived. (Sound familiar?) US support for Israel is also based in the Bible. It is believed, per prophecy, that when the nation of Israel is attacked by its surrounding enemies in a final battle, the Jewish Messiah will return to save his people and destroy the enemies of Israel. Christians believe the Jewish Messiah is Jesus and that ""final battle"" is the War Of Armageddon, ushering in the end of the world. The only two entities that will survive this ""End Of Times"" prophecy will be Israel, God's ""natural"" child and The Christian Church, God's ""adopted"" child. The Christian Church also has another reason for its support of ""God's People"", found in the Bible. Jacob, later re-named Israel, is told by God, ""I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you."" (Did I mention my belief the Bible is a book written by men, for men. It is NOT the ""word of god."") Thus, the US, a ""Christian"" nation - is intrinsically intertwined with Israel. From pulpits in churches across the country this Sunday will be heard dire warnings of the coming end of the world and the return of Jesus who will create a new earth and a new heaven, the ""New Jerusalem."" Some will be praying for it to happen. If we do not wake from slumber, shake open our eyes, use critical thinking skills, and rise to resist, religion will be the death of us.",,160,"{'like_count': 87, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 35257}",Espiritu Chicano,,2023-10-15 16:17:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/244335839_284956889970485_7596503866101793085_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Kb-dwcfpBMUAX-04aB2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDj-9NGHUg_xri8xgHh89j_P_qgt5SpMRtQYqT-kuRP4g&oe=655AC637,https://www.facebook.com/100079935015713/posts/315249194482912,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391750069_315249171149581_4814763635727224238_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=w4xWp4-zhWkAX80pJsb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDNGsBvHcvC8VeuEh90iHs3rSWYrGVbd46JrPvVcnvm7w&oe=6531C45A

facebook,"Jordan said Saturday any move by Israel to impose a new displacement of Palestinians would push the region to the ""abyss"" of a wider regional conflict. Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also said Israel's blocking of humanitarian aid to Gaza and forcing its residents to leave their homes as it escalates its military action were a ""flagrant"" breach of international law. Israel had given the entire population of the north of the Gaza Strip a Saturday morning deadline to move south ahead of an expected ground offensive to root out Hamas militants. It has said it will keep two roads open until 4 p.m. to allow people to escape. Safadi said the military campaign against Hamas was killing innocent civilians and would bring despair and destruction in its wake that would not bring security to Israel.

facebook,"""MY PLATEAU EXPERIENCE IN PEACE BUILDING HELPING BROKER INDUSTRIAL HARMONY"" LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT MINISTER LALONG Minister of Labour and Employment Simon Bako Lalong says the experience he gathered in pursuing peace building and conflict management is assisting him in his current assignment as he works to bring industrial harmony which is key for the delivery of President Tinubu‚Äôs Renewed Hope Agenda. Lalong was speaking during a thanksgiving service by the Izere Nation to honour the immediate past Secretary to Plateau State Government Prof. Danladi Abok Atu held at the St. Paul's Catholic Pastoral Area, Lamingo Gwafan, Jos North Local Government. Lalong said the years of hardwork and sacrifices in building an inclusive Plateau State devoid of discrimination, oppression and injustice provided a platform for all citizens to be part of governance. He said the building of confidence and trust is essential for any government to succeed particularly where there are agitations, grievances or differences that could be exploited if not properly handled. According to him, President Bola Tinubu is desirous of developing Nigeria by ensuring that workers give their best in the public and private sectors, hence the quick attention given to the recent planned labour strike which was averted through dialogue. Lalong used the opportunity to thank the former Secretary to Plateau State Government Prof. Danladi Abok Atu whom he said worked very hard with others in implementing the Rescue Agenda of his administration. He assured the people of Plateau State that he will continue to work for the interests of the State in the Federal Government using every opportunity to attract programmes and projects not only under his area of duty but in all ways possible. Catholic Archbishop of Jos Ishaya Audu described the former Governor as a political leader with vision and passion for carrying everyone along and working with experienced persons like Prof. Danladi Abok Atu to serve the people to their best ability. While asking him to forgive anyone that may have offended him during his tenure or during political activities, Archbishop Audu appealed to Lalong to lobby and stand firm for critical issues such as roads, schools, security and other entitlements of Plateau State as a member of the Federal Executive Council. In a Homily, Msgnr Prof. Cletus Gotan said service to people is service to God and so anyone given responsibility for public office must work hard to deliver according to their mandate and with the fear of God. He said the large crowd in attendance indicates that Prof. Atu worked well with people from all walks of life who have decided to join him in thanking God. The paramount ruler of the Izere Nation Adagwom Izere Dr. Isaac Wakili said the traditional council and the Afizere Cultural and Community Development Association decided to honour Prof. Atu because he is one of its illustrious sons who has done a lot in bringing development to the Chiefdom. He said Atu also served with integrity and brought pride to the Chiefdom by not engaging in any activity that will bring shame and dishonour. In his remarks the celebrant Prof. Danladi Abok Atu thanked God for sustaining him and giving him the opportunity for public service over many years including his last assignment as Secretary to Plateau State Government under Governor Simon Lalong. Atu praised the Minister of Labour for being a man of peace, competence, compassion and integrity and for giving him the opportunity to serve as Secretary to Government. He promised to sustain the trust and asked other former appointees to also rally round the former Governor and continue to work in building strong political structures that will be useful for service. The event was attended by dignitaries from within and outside the State including Mallam Balarabe Abbas Lawal, Minister Designate and former Secretary to Kaduna State Government. The Minister of Labour and Employment later hosted some of his former appointees in his residence comprising of commissioners, Heads of Boards and Parastatals and members of the House of Assembly.

facebook,"Zechariah 14 1 A day of the Lord is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls. 2 I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city. 3 Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle. 4 On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. 5 You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake[a] in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones [saints] with him. __________________________________ A few important points from Bible prophecy:- The world war against Israel will happen. Just not now. It will be towards the end of the tribulation. It will mark the 2nd coming of Christ back to earth. He will touch down on the Mount of Olives and there will be a major earthquake.The catching away of the saints will be to recue the church, the 2nd comng, will be to rescue israel. Notice that Christ returns with the holy ones. KJV says, the saints. They will have already been raptured 7 years prior. By Gods grace, we will not be here. Regardless of the tide turning against israel and nations uniting (even if they unite plus aliens), Israel will be plundered but not defeated. They will never again be kicked out of that land. Satan hates them and has a vendetta against them as the original people of God on earth and the people who birthed the Messiah on earth. He has tried to displace and destroy them ever since he knew. He will rally the nations for this onslaught. Sadly, he was able to deceive them into rejecting the Messiah. Also, they will be facing judgement for all the evil that they have done: Rejecting the Gospel, leading generations astray, deceptions, persecuting Christians, sabotaging nations and accepting the Antichrist. It will be very very tough for Israel. They will be massacred and raped and brutalized. By God's mercy, they will realise that the antichrist is the enemy and cry out to God. Jesus will defend them coz of Gods covenent with them as His original people on earth. He remains faithful even though they have been very unfaithful. Let nobody lie to you that all of todays Israelis are not real Jews. Ama you think that Jesus does not know and is coming to rescue frauds? Measure everything that youvsee, you hear and read against scripture. Let God be true and every man a liar. None of what is happening should scare a believer, it shaping up exactly as was written. Scripture does not lie. Isr√†el, though God's original people on earth, are not the holy ones today. You are! You who has accepted Jesus as your.Savior, no matter which nation you are from. And that includes all born again Palestinians and Jews as well. God does not just belong to one nation anymore. That is an Old Testament mentality. Your role is to forbid the pre emptying of satans agenda. To pray for the salvation of souls. To pray for those caught up in this conflict, even the Palestinians. God loves them too very much and they are caught up in this war as their leaders battle. Pray against injustice brutality, suffering and pain being meted out on innocent common people. They are helpless, are used as human shields and constantly bombed. Those who attacked Israel made them a target and they are really suffering for it. They have nowhere to run. Pray for Gods mercy and help. Except by His grace that could have been you and I. üò• Finally, pray for israel. God said that we should never despise them, even though they were cut off for gentiles to be grafted in. Mumebarikiwa!

facebook,"So within this group of over 40K, There seems to be a conflict of the moon. No one can explain on a working flat earth model, how the moon is between the sun and the earth for the Annular eclipse today. The next conflict is that the sun and moon are equal size and distance from earth and both are local, with the exception of the moon not covering the sun totally allowing the ring of fire viewing today. Next conflict is, that it is local and inside the firmament dome, the dome that rockets can‚Äôt get through, and separating our pressurized atmosphere from the vacuum of space. Yet man has not flown to the moon because no rockets can get to the moon because of the impenetrable firmament dome‚Ä¶ so is it inside or outside? Next conflict is that the moon is its own light emitting entity, made up of some photo luminescent gas, yet the same side of the moon faces earth, always and isn‚Äôt always lit up. but the side that is lit up is in the direction of the suns current position. The other conflict is that it‚Äôs been stated the moon isn‚Äôt solid because of the luminous, gaseous properties, yet we can clearly see impact craters and various terrain with a telescope. We can‚Äôt have all these conflicts within, The Flat Earth community‚Ä¶ The Globe Earth community has one conflict of wether man was on the moon or not‚Ä¶ every thing else fits within the math and physics and laws of motion and science.

facebook,"Around the Web: ‚ÄúAlice Miller‚Äôs stories portray abused and silenced children who later become destructive to themselves and to others. . . . ‚ÄòThe way we were treated as small children is the way we treat ourselves the rest of our lives: with cruelty or with tenderness and protection,‚Äô [Miller says]. ‚ÄòWe often impose our most agonizing suffering upon ourselves and, later, on our children.‚Äô In 1979 Miller‚Äôs first book, The Drama of the Gifted Child, was published in Germany. First titled Prisoners of Childhood, its three short essays described how parents project their feelings, ideas, and dreams upon their children. To survive and be loved, a child learns to obey. In repressing his or her feelings, the child stifles attempts to be herself or himself. The result, said Miller, is all too often depression, ebbing of vitality, the loss of self. . . . there is hope in therapy if the therapist is a true advocate of the patient. Respect for the child within the patient and his discovery of his real history must play a role in the treatment process. The child undergoes a long inner struggle ‚Äòbetween the fear of losing the person he loves if he remains true to himself, and panic at the prospect of losing himself if he has to deny who he is. A child cannot resolve a conflict of this nature and is forced to conform because he cannot survive by himself. Therapy should not repeat this condition.‚Äô""",,150,"{'like_count': 68, 'comment_count': 21, 'num_users': 37462}",Mad In America,,2023-10-15 00:44:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/303293617_491807746283423_7562558983721396811_n.jpg?stp=c1.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=baA5aGnPkI8AX_229nx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBAimsvlycmlMt04ZU_fA2-OSfPhkZE7kHu_Xl3jKDfFQ&oe=655A218F,https://www.facebook.com/100063626058590/posts/804746251656236,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/12946531380701072969?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madinamerica.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F10%2Falice-miller-feeling-child-2-e1697328769262.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=madinamerica.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbHUSnjCxOq-xrrXqPPVCtnisaWA2g0Bja_o3oj5cMiktA&oe=652CAD5F

Romanelli told the Italian news agency that Francis shared ‚Äúhis closeness and prayers for the entire Church community of Gaza and all the parishioners and inhabitants‚Äù and imparted his blessing on them. The priest, who is currently stranded in Bethlehem after visiting the town following a trip to Rome in late September, said he thanked Pope Francis for his appeal for peace after his Angelus message on Sunday. The Israeli military announced Oct. 9 it was imposing a total blockade on the Gaza Strip after Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, launched an attack on Israel over the weekend.

In August, we opened a new surgical Centre in #Khartoum to provide urgent care to those who cannot receive it in other facilities. Here we receive people burned by explosions, wounded by bullets and mines, but also patients injured in accidents or by civilian trauma. Since opening the Centre, we have treated more than 500 people. We continue cardiac surgery and cardiology at the Salam Centre even though it is becoming increasingly difficult for patients to travel. In general, it is difficult to get supplies of even essential goods, fuel and medicines; every day there is a new difficulty, in addition to deteriorating security conditions.

facebook,"AFFECTIONATE PERO WALANG LABEL Hello, manghihingi sana ako ng advice, pero bago yon, kuwento ko muna kung ano ang happenings. Medyo mahaba ito. There's this guy na kagrupo ko sa thesis, hindi kami close nong una, pero habang nakakasama ko siya sa paggawa ng thesis ay napapalapit ang loob ko sa kanya. Until I started to have a crush on him last month. Sa thesis group kasi namin, madalas good vibes at (humorous) asaran ang nangyayari, tapos don ako sa asaran namin na-fall. HAHA! Kapag inaasar niya ako, inaasar ko rin siya. Safe naman kasi parehas kaming walang jowa (NBSB ako and I think NGSB rin siya, base lang sa aking research. HAHAHA!). Parehas din kasi kaming introvert at taong bahay. Tapos ito, feeling ko may something din siya para sa akin, e. Kapag gumagawa kami ng manuscript, madalas niya akong tabihan at minsan sinasandalan niya rin ako. May times na nagkakasabay kami pauwi dahil kaming dalawa yong parehas ng way, at kapag umuulan ay nakiki-share siya sa kin ng payong kahit may payong din siyang dala. Kapag nagyaya akong maglakad, sumasama siya. May isang beses na nasa tricycle kami, tapos ako naman ang naglakas-loob na sumandal sa balikat niya. His response? Sinandal niya rin ang ulo niya sa ulo ko, tapos nilagay niya yong kamay niya sa tuhod ko. After that, may dalawang beses na muntik na niya akong akbayan habang naglalakad kami, kaso binabawi niya, e. Marami na rin kaming naging group overnights para sa thesis at ganon pa rin, tinatabihan niya ako at inaasar. Tapos, kapag nagbabalot ako ng kumot kasi madali akong lamigin sa aircon, nakiki-share din siya sa kumot ko habang gumagawa kami ng manuscript. May times na dinidikit niya yong binti niya sa binti ko o di kaya ay ipapatong niya ang kamay niya sa tuhod ko. Hinahayaan ko naman siya kasi comfortable naman ako na kinikilig deep inside. HAHAHA! O di ba, feeling ko mag-jowa na kami kasi ang close namin physically. But, here comes the conflict. Kapag nag-uusap kaming dalawa ay tungkol lang din sa thesis or something related. Yong asaran namin ay nangyayari lang kapag kasama namin ang groupmates namin. Once ay nagkakuwentuhan naman kaming dalawa about sa mga nababasa naming stories kasi parehas kaming reader, pero magkaiba ng medium kasi siya sa manga, ako naman sa novel. Parang yon lang ang napag-usapan namin na tungkol sa amin. Hindi ko alam kung paano ko siya kakausapin personally, at hindi rin naman siya nag-i-initiate ng ganong convo. About thesis and school stuff lang talaga ang napapag-usapan. Minsan nga, as in tahimik lang kaming magkasama pauwi. Same thing sa chats. Hindi humahaba ang convo namin, saka minsan ang tagal din kasi niyang mag-reply, tapos ang dry ng messages niya. Tapos, kapag hindi kami gumagawa ng thesis, like papasok lang sa school ganon, bihira niya akong pansinin. Napapaisip tuloy ako na baka wala naman pala talaga siyang feelings para sa kin. Naguguluhan na ako kung ano ba tong meron sa pagitan namin, or kung meron ba talaga. Tingin niyo ba, dapat ko na siyang i-confront? I really like him. Tatanggapin ko kahit anong kalalabasan ng pag-uusap namin, gusto ko lang talagang malinawan. Kaso iniisip ko, baka hindi lang talaga siya ready at matakot ko. Hindi rin ako sanay sa confrontation, baka maiyak ako, iyakin pa naman ako kapag nag-overflow na ang feelings. HAHAHA! What do you think? Too soon for a confession, or i-push ko na?

Matthew 13:42

READ:
MATTHEW 13:24-30, 36-43

24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.

26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.

27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?

28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.

30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.

37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;

38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.

41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;

42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

MESSAGE:

Those who don't end up in the City of God will end up in another place that I cannot describe as a city. I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: ""And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."" 

All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: ""Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.""

The passage does not say 'the worm' does not die, but 'their worm'. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire.

There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their actions or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely.

REFLECTION:

Think about it carefully: are you willing to go to hell becasuse of that sin you keep committing? If not, stop it today.

facebook,"World Food Day, 16th October ‚ÄúWater is life, water is food. Leave no one behind‚Äù. At the Sir Brian Bell Foundation, we proudly support World Food Day and the 2023 theme ‚ÄúWater is life, water is food. Leave no one behind‚Äù. Water is one of the planet's most precious resources, it must be protected and preserved so everyone has access to clean and safe water solutions. What we eat and how we prepare our food all affect the water in our community. As individuals we all have a part to play in ensuring we improve the way we use water in our daily lives for future generations. Bronwyn Wright, CEO of the Sir Brian Bell Foundation commented ‚ÄúAs a nation we have progressed to consuming more packaged and fast foods out of convenience, which often has negative impacts on our health and our environment. Healthy habits make for healthy bodies and healthy minds so, try and fill your plate with local PNG produce and wash it down with fresh and clean water. The more natural and unprocessed the better it will be for you. We‚Äôre lucky to have so much local food to choose from in our beautiful country. At the end of the day, you are what you eat!‚Äù commented Sir Brian Bell Foundation, CEO, Ms Bronwyn Wright. Let‚Äôs all work together for a more nourished nation, take action and reduce water waste for our future generations. United Nations: Water is essential to life on Earth. It makes up over 50% of our bodies and covers about 71% of the Earth's surface. Only 2.5% of water is fresh, suitable for drinking, agriculture, and most industrial uses. Water is a driving force for people, economies and nature and the foundation of our food. Indeed, agriculture accounts for 72% of global freshwater withdrawals, but like all natural resources, fresh water is not infinite. Rapid population growth, urbanization, economic development, and climate change are putting the planet‚Äôs water resources under increasing stress. At the same time, freshwater resources per person have declined by 20% in the past decades and water availability and quality are deteriorating fast due to decades of poor use and management, over-extraction of groundwater, pollution, and climate change. We risk stretching this precious resource to a point of no return. Today, 2.4 billion people live in water-stressed countries. Many are smallholder farmers who already struggle to meet their daily needs, particularly women, Indigenous Peoples, migrants, and refugees. Competition for this priceless resource is increasing as water scarcity becomes an ever-increasing cause of conflict. Around 600 million people who depend, at least partially, on aquatic food systems for a living are suffering the effects of pollution, ecosystem degradation, unsustainable practices, and climate change. It‚Äôs time to start managing water wisely. We need to produce more food and other essential agricultural commodities with less water while ensuring water is distributed equally, our aquatic food systems are preserved, and nobody is left behind. Governments need to design science and evidence-based policies that capitalize on data, innovation, and cross-sectoral coordination to better plan and manage water. They need to support these policies with increased investment, legislation, technologies, and capacity development while incentivizing farmers and the private sector to engage in integrated solutions for a more efficient use of water, and for its conservation. We all need to stop taking water for granted and start improving the way we use it in our daily lives. What we eat, and how that food is produced all affect water. We can make a difference by choosing local, seasonal, and fresh foods, wasting less of it - even by reducing food waste, and finding safe ways to reuse it while preventing water pollution. Together, we can take water action for the future of food, people, and the planet.

facebook,"Ballykissangel is a BBC television drama created by Kieran Prendiville and set in Ireland, produced in-house by BBC Northern Ireland. The original story revolved around a young English Roman Catholic priest as he became part of a rural community. It ran for six series, which were first broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom from 1996 to 2001. It aired in Ireland on RT√â One and in Australia on ABC TV from 1996 to 2001. Repeats have been shown on Drama in the United Kingdom and in the United States on some PBS affiliates. The series was made and set during the Celtic Tiger economic period in Ireland and this features mainly through Tony Doyle‚Äôs character, Brian Quigley. The show is also set amid the backdrop of the Catholic Church scandal and explores controversial themes of the time such as divorce (which had only been legalised a year before the series began), and pre-marital sex. Dervla Kirwan‚Äôs and Niall Toibin‚Äôs characters are often at odds, symbolising the social conflict between traditional Ireland and social liberalisation. Significant changes in the cast occurred at the end of series 3 following the departure of central characters Peter Clifford and Assumpta Fitzgerald. A band of new characters were brought in and characters that previously had little story were expanded, such as Kathleen, Niamh, Frank and Brian. The show faced a decline in ratings from a peak level of 10 million viewers to 4.8 million and was eventually cancelled in 2001. The name of the fictional village in which the show was set is derived from Ballykissane, a townland near Killorglin in County Kerry, where the show's creator, Kieran Prendiville, holidayed with his family as a child.

facebook,"Life feels heavy right now. It‚Äôs good and there‚Äôs so much I‚Äôm thankful for and I don‚Äôt let the darkness outweigh the light of good shining on me but I‚Äôm honest. Life‚Äôs hard. Health scares and unknowns, broken relationships and unsolved issues. Conflict and confusion and feels like no matter the option the outcome is going to still suck. Because sometimes things just suck. And I‚Äôve let myself get lost in the suck today. I hate that. I kept busy but my mind raced more than the activities I did. Listened to music, which normally calms me but today I just heard sadness. Tried reading but after reading the same paragraph over and over I gave up. I took P to the store because I love to buy half the grocery and bring home nothing of nutritional value but he loves going with. We walked in and he went to get the buggy and then stopped to let an older lady pass, he smiled and gave her the ‚Äúgo ahead‚Äù with his hand and she was beaming and smiled at us both. A guy passed us and P gave him the universal man nod, like ‚Äúwassup‚Äù and the guy did it back and smiled then looked at me and winked. P brings joy to others by just being. He scanned all the groceries, used my card to pay then grabbed the bags, ‚Äúhere mom, let me‚Ä¶‚Äù We walked outside and it was gloomy and cold and he was struggling to carry the bags but I looked at him and my heart was just full. If you were to list the things he doesn‚Äôt have, the people who have disappointed him, the things that should leave a mark on him, there‚Äôd be too many for his young heart to process. You wouldn‚Äôt know it by looking at him. He loves his people big. He looks for ways to include others. He goes out of his way to help. He sings to himself day and night because he has music in his heart that speaks louder than anything negative around him. We got in the car and I looked in the rear view mirror as he was digging into the Oreos and as I was about to tell him how proud of him I was he said something that made me cry. ‚ÄúMama, I‚Äôm sad. I should have made that lady‚Äôs day.‚Äù I asked what he was talking about and he said he should have given that lady his buggy instead of just moving it to let her pass. I told him that he has a huge heart and that‚Äôs a great idea for next time but I bet that that lady‚Äôs day was made because a really handsome, sweet and kind person saw her, acknowledged her and smiled her way. He looked at me and smiled, with Oreos all in his teeth and said, ‚Äúyea, true!‚Äù We overcomplicate things. We concentrate too much on what we didn‚Äôt do instead of acknowledging what we did. What we have done well and right and good. Not everyone we passed greeted P with the same smile and excitement as he was giving but it didn‚Äôt stop him from giving it to the next person. There‚Äôs a lot on my heart and Satan likes to use these moments to remind me of all I‚Äôm lacking, all I‚Äôm missing and how much doesn‚Äôt make sense. My son was a gentle reminder today that it doesn‚Äôt take much to make a beautiful day and if the one person doesn‚Äôt smile back at you, smile again at the next one. Sometimes in the middle of a perfectly annoying day where everything gets on your nerves, you‚Äôre reminded of how beautiful the simple is by the brightest of lights. üíóüíó Just a Girl, With a lot to say",,134,"{'like_count': 42, 'comment_count': 21, 'num_users': 291214}","Just a Girl, With a lot to say",,2023-10-15 23:42:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/394539206_845240014061641_6589704387581061429_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xbcTM-wkRgUAX9bYe5B&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCrDYZjNFLYivy3SXJShxp_bHy0G0rAXWdVjQPucbgbpw&oe=655B2FB4,https://www.facebook.com/100057269507388/posts/841805391071770,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391612860_841804997738476_9123214713217494929_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=G1bqeO8c20YAX934-y2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDknu60hsNOQjApB5ch9T4IB7nbjah0_-cjE4KOQ76izQ&oe=653C7D8C

facebook,"AFFECTIONATE PERO WALANG LABEL Hello, manghihingi sana ako ng advice, pero bago yon, kuwento ko muna kung ano ang happenings. Medyo mahaba ito. There's this guy na kagrupo ko sa thesis, hindi kami close nong una, pero habang nakakasama ko siya sa paggawa ng thesis ay napapalapit ang loob ko sa kanya. Until I started to have a crush on him last month. Sa thesis group kasi namin, madalas good vibes at (humorous) asaran ang nangyayari, tapos don ako sa asaran namin na-fall. HAHA! Kapag inaasar niya ako, inaasar ko rin siya. Safe naman kasi parehas kaming walang jowa (NBSB ako and I think NGSB rin siya, base lang sa aking research. HAHAHA!). Parehas din kasi kaming introvert at taong bahay. Tapos ito, feeling ko may something din siya para sa akin, e. Kapag gumagawa kami ng manuscript, madalas niya akong tabihan at minsan sinasandalan niya rin ako. May times na nagkakasabay kami pauwi dahil kaming dalawa yong parehas ng way, at kapag umuulan ay nakiki-share siya sa kin ng payong kahit may payong din siyang dala. Kapag nagyaya akong maglakad, sumasama siya. May isang beses na nasa tricycle kami, tapos ako naman ang naglakas-loob na sumandal sa balikat niya. His response? Sinandal niya rin ang ulo niya sa ulo ko, tapos nilagay niya yong kamay niya sa tuhod ko. After that, may dalawang beses na muntik na niya akong akbayan habang naglalakad kami, kaso binabawi niya, e. Marami na rin kaming naging group overnights para sa thesis at ganon pa rin, tinatabihan niya ako at inaasar. Tapos, kapag nagbabalot ako ng kumot kasi madali akong lamigin sa aircon, nakiki-share din siya sa kumot ko habang gumagawa kami ng manuscript. May times na dinidikit niya yong binti niya sa binti ko o di kaya ay ipapatong niya ang kamay niya sa tuhod ko. Hinahayaan ko naman siya kasi comfortable naman ako na kinikilig deep inside. HAHAHA! O di ba, feeling ko mag-jowa na kami kasi ang close namin physically. But, here comes the conflict. Kapag nag-uusap kaming dalawa ay tungkol lang din sa thesis or something related. Yong asaran namin ay nangyayari lang kapag kasama namin ang groupmates namin. Once ay nagkakuwentuhan naman kaming dalawa about sa mga nababasa naming stories kasi parehas kaming reader, pero magkaiba ng medium kasi siya sa manga, ako naman sa novel. Parang yon lang ang napag-usapan namin na tungkol sa amin. Hindi ko alam kung paano ko siya kakausapin personally, at hindi rin naman siya nag-i-initiate ng ganong convo. About thesis and school stuff lang talaga ang napapag-usapan. Minsan nga, as in tahimik lang kaming magkasama pauwi. Same thing sa chats. Hindi humahaba ang convo namin, saka minsan ang tagal din kasi niyang mag-reply, tapos ang dry ng messages niya. Tapos, kapag hindi kami gumagawa ng thesis, like papasok lang sa school ganon, bihira niya akong pansinin. Napapaisip tuloy ako na baka wala naman pala talaga siyang feelings para sa kin. Naguguluhan na ako kung ano ba tong meron sa pagitan namin, or kung meron ba talaga. Tingin niyo ba, dapat ko na siyang i-confront? I really like him. Tatanggapin ko kahit anong kalalabasan ng pag-uusap namin, gusto ko lang talagang malinawan. Kaso iniisip ko, baka hindi lang talaga siya ready at matakot ko. Hindi rin ako sanay sa confrontation, baka maiyak ako, iyakin pa naman ako kapag nag-overflow na ang feelings. HAHAHA! What do you think? Too soon for a confession, or i-push ko na?

facebook,"As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continued to rage on, Caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani on Sunday equated Israel‚Äôs airstrikes on Gaza and the siege of the territory to conducting genocide against the people of Palestine. The statement comes after Israel imposed a ‚Äútotal siege‚Äù to stop food and fuel from reaching the enclave of 2.3 million people, many poor and dependent on aid in response to a surprise Hamas offensive last week that left 1,300 Israelis dead, according to officials. In retaliatory air and artillery strikes, Israeli forces have flattened entire neighbourhoods, hospitals and schools in Gaza. Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since last week have killed at least 2,215 people, including 724 children, the Palestinian territory‚Äôs Hamas-controlled health ministry said on Saturday. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the minister noted that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had called an emergency meeting of its executive committee in Jeddah on October 18, adding that he would be in attendance. https://www.dawn.com/news/1781220/fm-jilani-equates-israeli-strikes-blockade-of-gaza-to-genocide-against-palestinians:=:https://www.dawn.com/news/1781220 #DawnToday",,132,"{'like_count': 84, 'comment_count': 31, 'num_users': 3035999}",Dawn.com,,2023-10-15 11:23:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352236637_249599724375948_1749765537981664225_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6lSTKuuFkSYAX8Kvi-8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAH2d_pbHnWkeGyk-6amxsm2mM3S8VmpkZDD0tfIWyGDA&oe=6559FD28,https://www.facebook.com/100064849416278/posts/723009026537405,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391616624_723008789870762_5012958184490264395_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=kSOyGy2LqVAAX-hQf8Y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDha72XKmptaksL9FK9SYIXBkd8alg_9nsKwdbJ4hQdjA&oe=6534F23F

facebook,"INTERCONNECTED Embracing Life in Our Global Society -- BEING THE BEST EVER -- ""We would be far better off learning how to enjoy what we already have rather than chasing more things. Some people believe that dissatisfaction is healthy because it ensures that we will keep progressing in life. They suggest that if we allow ourselves to feel content with what we have, we will become complacent and stop all forward motion. But this is not how it works. There is no inherent conflict between feeling content and progressing in our lives."" The Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, ""INTERCONNECTED - Embracing Life in Our Global Society"", pp72-73.

facebook,"On this date in 1970, CANNED HEAT debuted at No. 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with their single LET'S WORK TOGETHER (Oct 10, 1970)

NOTE: The video here is CANNED HEAT performing LET'S WORK TOGETHER on the German TV show 'Beat Club' in 1970. I've upscaled and improved the colour saturation of the original film.

A blues-based rhythm and blues number that made a plea for fidelity in a fractured marriage, 'Let's Stick Together' was written by Wilbert Harrison and released in 1962, Harrison further developed the song and in 1969 when issued it was issued as a two-part single titled ""Let's Work Together"".

Changing the title to ""Let's Work Together,"" Harrison's new message of unity was aimed at a nation rife with conflict over the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. 

Shortly after the release of Wilbert Harrison's ""Let's Work Together"", L.A. blues-rock band Canned Heat recorded their version of the song. 

Unlike their previous singles (""On the Road Again"", ""Going Up the Country"", and ""Time Was"") that featured vocals and harmonica by Alan Wilson, for ""Let's Work Together"" Bob Hite provided the vocals, with Wilson adding the slide-guitar parts.

The song was prepared for release as a single in December 1969, but was cancelled due to the popularity of Harrison's single.

In the UK, where Harrison's single failed to generate interest, Canned Heat's version was released in January 1970.

There it became their biggest hit, reaching number two on the UK Singles chart during a stay of fifteen weeks.

Several artists subsequently recorded the songs: ""Let's Work Together"" by Canned Heat (1970) and ""Let's Stick Together"" by Bryan Ferry (1976) were both chart successes.

Canned Heat didn't mean to overshadow Harrison with their version. In fact, if they'd known the singer was going to have success with it, they never would have recorded it in the first place. 

They first heard the tune when it was still making the rounds at underground radio stations. Their new guitarist Harvey Mandel played it for the rest of the guys and suggested they cover it, but their co-vocalist, Bob ""The Bear"" Hite, wanted to wait a few months to see if Harrison would chart first. 

According to drummer Adolfo de la Parra, Hite didn't like taking songs away from living black musicians unless they weren't hits.

""If the song languished among blues collectors, then he thought we could carry it to a bigger audience and at least get the composer writer's royalties,"" de la Parra wrote in his book, Living The Blues. 

They recorded the tune in December 1969 without knowing Harrison would get a chart entry just a couple months later.

""It was the perfect vehicle for Bob, summoning the world to get together and make someone happy,"" de la Parra explained.

It was his greatest performance and only hit. The song also enhanced Canned Heat's dual character, a band with two lead singers with very different styles and voices.""",,129,"{'like_count': 68, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 264934}",Peace love & Music from the 60s,,2023-10-15 05:57:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/153870629_1772683559575755_7555222254574759206_n.jpg?stp=c0.4.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=dnl2AVjBeI4AX8p46eL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA8NT2_paBUboeb37YHOIlc7pd4VxgS8L8Da8HpPDCQgw&oe=657D38BD,https://www.facebook.com/groups/2721707568108052/permalink/3628904927388307,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/118529621_3190417887674343_8069610511079062982_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=FFD9QHqkorsAX9hb9oM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCgQ769aFXFt-7fCs2hn1lan-MRptGio4cFoycq_D_gig&oe=65312BC8

facebook,"Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (1137 ‚Äì 4 March 1193) Commonly known as Saladin (Honour of the Faith) or the King Who Grants Victory, Sultan of Egypt and Syria, and Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. Was the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. Hailing from a Kurdish family, he was the first Sultan of both Egypt and Syria. At the height of his power, the Ayyubid realm spanned Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen, and Nubia. Although the Ayyubid dynasty that he founded would outlive him by only 57 years, the legacy of Saladin within the Arab World continues to this day. With the rise of Arab nationalism in the 20th Century, particularly with regard to the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, Saladin's heroism and leadership gained a new significance. Saladin's recapture of Palestine from the European Crusaders is considered an inspiration for modern-day Arabs' opposition to Zionism. Saladin was widely renowned in medieval Europe as a model of kingship, and in particular of the courtly virtue of regal generosity. In The Divine Comedy (1308‚Äì1320), Dante mentiones him as one of the virtuous non-Christians. In 1171, he abolished the Cairo-based Shia Muslim Caliphate and realigned Egypt with the Baghdad-based Sunni Abbasid Caliphate. In the following years, he led forays against the Crusaders in Palestine, and commissioned the successful conquest of Yemen. Crusader attacks provoked further responses by Saladin. Raynald of Ch√¢tillon, in particular, harassed Muslim trading and pilgrimage routes with a fleet on the Red Sea, a water route that Saladin needed to keep open. Raynald threatened to attack the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. On 4 July 1187, Saladin faced the combined forces of Guy of Lusignan, King Consort of Jerusalem, and Raymond III of Tripoli at the Battle of Hattin. In this battle alone the Crusader force was largely annihilated by Saladin's determined army. It was a major disaster for the Crusaders and a turning point in the history of the Crusades. Saladin captured Raynald and was personally responsible for his execution in retaliation for his attacks against Muslim caravans. The members of these caravans had, in vain, besought his mercy by reciting the truce between the Muslims and the Crusaders, but Raynald ignored this and insulted the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, before murdering and torturing some of them. Upon hearing this, Saladin swore an oath to personally execute Raynald. Guy of Lusignan was also captured. Seeing the execution of Raynald, he feared he would be next. However, his life was spared by Saladin, who said of Raynald, ""it is not the wont of kings, to kill kings; but that man had transgressed all bounds, and therefore did I treat him thus."" Capture of Jerusalem Saladin had captured almost every Crusader city. Saladin preferred to take Jerusalem without bloodshed and offered generous terms, but those inside refused to leave their holy city, vowing to destroy it in a fight to the death rather than see it handed over peacefully. Jerusalem capitulated to his forces on Friday, 2 October 1187, after a siege. When the siege had started, Saladin was unwilling to promise terms of quarter to the Frankish inhabitants of Jerusalem. Balian of Ibelin threatened to kill every Muslim hostage, estimated at 5,000, and to destroy Islam's holy shrines of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque if such quarter were not provided. Saladin consulted his council and the terms were accepted. The agreement was read out through the streets of Jerusalem so that everyone might within forty days provide for himself and pay to Saladin the agreed tribute for his freedom. An unusually low ransom was to be paid for each Frank in the city, whether man, woman, or child, but Saladin, against the wishes of his treasurers, allowed many families who could not afford the ransom to leave. Upon the capture of Jerusalem, Saladin summoned the Jews and permitted them to resettle in the city. Saladin died of a fever on 4 March 1193 (27 Safar 589 AH) at Damascus, not long after King Richard's departure. In Saladin's possession at the time of his death were one piece of gold and forty pieces of silver. He had given away his great wealth to his poor subjects, leaving nothing to pay for his funeral. He was buried in a mausoleum in the garden outside the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria. Seven centuries later, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany donated a new marble sarcophagus to the mausoleum. However, the original sarcophagus was not replaced. 20th-century French author Albert Champdor described him as ""Le plus pur h√©ros de l'Islam"" (English: The purest Hero of Islam). Despite the Crusaders' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common Catholics and even to the defeated Christian army (the Greek Orthodox Christians were treated even better because they often opposed the western Crusaders). Notwithstanding the differences in beliefs, the Muslim Saladin was (truncated)",,122,"{'like_count': 89, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 59508}",Kaduna belongs to us,,2023-10-15 11:15:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/378681242_715518757281474_735952626248707574_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jrStqJr8TXoAX-w_JOn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC9hIXi9u5WjcVfiY9MkcyDrEhz5NGZLjSnZ3XkZpYexA&oe=655B91E2,https://www.facebook.com/100064700678158/posts/736949828471700,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391734315_736949581805058_3666901835758124722_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8I_8wDOU0e8AX9PYnfW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDGPEWOekOqozrFTuP8M1quT4soXwIlcyQjBXL7VEtKeg&oe=65312D20

instagram,"Conflict can actually create deeper connections between people - but only if managed constructively. 
‚Äå
Conflict happens when people have differing opinions, needs, or desires, and how it's approached and resolved can impact relationships.
‚Äå
Avoiding conflict by suppressing your feelings, avoiding difficult conversations, or pleasing others can lead to surface-level relationships where true thoughts and emotions are not expressed. This avoidance may create a fa√ßade of harmony but can hinder authentic connections.
‚Äå
On the other hand, when you engage in conflicts openly and respectfully, you have the opportunity to express your viewpoints, understand each other's perspectives, and work through differences.
‚Äå
Here‚Äôs three ways you can do this:
‚Äå
‚ñ´Ô∏èSeek Compromise: Instead of aiming for a win-lose outcome, strive for a win-win solution. Look for common ground and compromise where possible.
‚Äå
‚ñ´Ô∏èAwareness of Emotions: Before engaging in a conflict, it‚Äôs essential to be aware of your own emotions. Understand what you‚Äôre feeling and why.
‚Äå
‚ñ´Ô∏èUse ‚ÄúI‚Äù Statements: Express your feelings and concerns using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements, such as ‚ÄúI feel hurt when‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned about‚Ä¶‚Äù This approach focuses on your own emotions and experiences rather than making accusatory ‚Äúyou‚Äù statements, which can escalate the conflict.
‚Äå
Approaching conflict with empathy, effective communication, and a willingness to find common ground can help turn conflicts into opportunities for growth and connection.

The moves come as MSNBC ‚Äî like the Democratic Party with which it‚Äôs often aligned ‚Äî has swung into intense solidarity with the Jewish state after the murderous Hamas attacks. That shift has come with heated internal and external objections to anything that breaks with that solidarity, and has come with social media criticism of Hasan, Mohyeldin, and Velshi. Hasan has also been vocal on X, formerly known as Twitter, condemning the Hamas attack and calling attention to the plight of civilians in Gaza.

In 2014, Mohyeldin, the network‚Äôs most experienced reporter in Gaza, was abruptly pulled from NBC‚Äôs coverage of the region and replaced by Richard Engel for several days. CNN reported at the time that NBC executives did not give him a concrete explanation beyond citing vague ‚Äúsecurity reasons.‚Äù Semafor reported that when violence erupted in Gaza in 2021, MSNBC executives had privately expressed discomfort with hosts Hasan and Mohyeldin for their coverage.

Conservative media has put pressure on MSNBC to shift further toward Israel in its coverage.

The criticism of the three MSNBC hosts ‚Äî three of the most high-profile Muslim on-air personalities on the network‚Äî seems vastly disproportionate to anything they‚Äôve said on air. 

NBC did not release a statement about why it pulled Mohyeldin in 2014. And when I wrote an article about Hasan and Mohyeldin‚Äôs coverage of the flare-up in 2021, MSNBC did not make either host available for comment. MSNBC appears to be avoiding any suggestion that it could be aligned with a view that‚Äôs more centered on Palestinian civilians, and trying to protect itself and its Muslim stars by putting them in the roles of correspondents and analysts, not at the center of its programming. ‚Äî Max Tani for Semafor

instagram,"US News:
The United States has confirmed sending an additional carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean in response to the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict.

In a bid to dissuade foreign interference in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the deployment of the USS Eisenhower strike group. Joining the USS Ford Strike Group, which arrived earlier, Austin said, ""The increases to US force posture signals the United States' ironclad commitment to Israel's security and our resolve to deter any state or non-state actor seeking to escalate this war."" 

The USS Eisenhower carrier's fleet comprises the USS Philippine Sea, a guided-missile cruiser, the USS Gravel and USS Mason destroyers, and nine aircraft squadrons. The USS Ford Strike Group includes the USS Normandy cruiser, destroyers including the USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney, and USS Roosevelt, along with eight aircraft squadrons. In addition, F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft have also arrived in Jordan. 

This comes as President Biden has pledged staunch support for Israel and recent visits by top US officials. Following a recent visit to Israel, Austin communicated with his Israeli counterpart, emphasizing adherence to warfare regulations and safeguarding non-combatants. 

The United States has also warned Iran to stay out of the conflict, a message echoed by other European allies, including France. 

Iran statements:
In a statement from Iran‚Äôs UN mission earlier today,  they said, ""If the Israeli apartheid's war crimes & genocide are not halted immediately, the situation could spiral out of control & ricochet far-reaching consequences - the responsibility of which lies with the UN, the Security Council & the states steering the Council toward a dead end.""

Updated casualties: 
The death toll in Gaza sits at 2,228 dead and 8,744 injured (according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health). Israel's death toll sits at 1,300, with 3,227 wounded (according to the Israeli government).",,19438,"{'like_count': 18542, 'comment_count': 896, 'num_users': 966663}","Real News, Not Bullshit",,2023-10-15 00:21:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/210871732_2297447983890016_8350712253230690398_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nBbjySDBVlQAX87JSho&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBk14T-MaDPBNwPwWX3loRBZR46eror1wY2VFxIvbBxVg&oe=6559C8F0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZi4iUPb5U/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391404987_235875336151576_77786016922120479_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=DY0z7uXAqx8AX-Qm4w3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA9HfTPPPbFw2ZKCRsjWwUiebHnb90SZcj6AL7r0YblxQ&oe=65474267

instagram,"Regardless of one's religious or cultural background, it is imperative as humans that we cannot turn a blind eye to the dire situation unfolding in Palestine. We cannot, and must not, stay silent; we must talk about it openly. This is not a 'complicated conflict,' nor is it a situation that necessitates excessive nuance. It's not a 'geopolitical event' that requires us to make vague condemnations of 'bad actors' on 'both sides.'

What we are witnessing is nothing short of a genocide. The Israeli state's actions against the Palestinian people are unequivocally a genocide, and it is occurring right before our eyes. There is no room for ambiguity; it is a genocide, carried out by the Israeli state against the Palestinian population. You don't need to read between the lines: Israel has openly, with little resistance from so-called liberal democracies, severed Gaza's access to essential resources such as water, food, and electricity. This has left more than two million Palestinians, including a million children, deprived of even the most basic necessities for life.

Consider this staggering fact: in just six days, Israel has dropped 6,000 bombs on the besieged coastal enclave, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, half of whom are innocent children. Israel's use of internationally banned white phosphorus, the heartbreaking deaths of babies as young as seven days old, and their orders for 1.1 million people to evacuate their homes within 24 hours, followed by bombings that injure and kill those attempting to flee, are all reprehensible acts.

What we are witnessing is nothing less than ethnic cleansing in full view of the world. We cannot, in good conscience, look away from these unspeakable horrors. It is our moral duty to discuss this crisis openly and take decisive action to bring it to an end. Humanity demands nothing less.

Furthermore, it is crucial to be aware that Instagram is actively restricting accounts that post about the situation in Palestine. Therefore, we urge you to share and talk about it as much as possible to ensure that the truth is not silenced.

Eclipses obscure light, metaphorically forcing us to find it within. To foster it. To refuse to let it be extinguished no matter what it is we face. 
.
Life is light. Life is the most sacred thing, the only thing to defend. Not power. Not borders. I dream of states of abundance and shared resources (like friendship). I dream of children being taught how to honor conflict and create peace. I dream of people migrating because they can, not fleeing because they have to. 
.
I am grieving the loss of life, hope, and any kind of progress that Israeli, Palestinian and international peace activists have made over the past many decades. 
.
This was the first of a series of eclipses in Libra near the south node - a point of emptying and release. It feels more like a tear through the fabric of our universe and I wonder how we could ever come back from it - or build forward from it. It feels impossible - but it is not. As Libra and the poets teach us, the way makes itself known when we go together. Only together.

Insecure attachment represents a lack of connection to self the difficulty connecting to your partner. What is connection? Connection is a feeling of closeness and safety, a sharing of selves. Even during conflict, partners can learn to maintain connection. Even when your partner is acting out of fear, you can still do your part to maintain connection. Even when you are acting out of fear, your partner can still do their part to maintain connection. How do you connect?

instagram,"A 6-year-old boy is dead, and his mother seriously wounded after they were both stabbed more than a dozen times due to their Muslim faith Saturday in a Chicago suburb.

Around 11:38 a.m., deputies with the Will County Sheriff's Office responded to a home located near the intersection of S. Lincoln Highway and Lily Cache Road in Plainfield for a report of a stabbing.

A 32-year-old woman had called 9-1-1 and stated her landlord had attacked her with a knife, and that she ran into the bathroom and continued to fight off her attacker as she dialed 9-1-1.

When officers arrived at the scene, they located the suspect ‚Äì identified as 71-year-old Joseph M. Czuba ‚Äì sitting on the ground outside the home with a laceration to his forehead. He was transported to an area hospital for treatment.

Inside the home, in a bedroom, police say they located two victims who had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso, and upper extremities. The 32-year-old woman was hospitalized in serious condition with over a dozen stab wounds to her body. A 6-year-old boy had also suffered 26 stab wounds throughout his body and was pronounced dead at the hospital.

The knife used in the attack was seven inches long and serrated.

Czuba was treated and released from the hospital, and taken by police for questioning. He was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

""Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,"" according to the Will County Sheriff's Office.

The weapon used in this ""heinous crime"" was recovered, police said.

The investigation is ongoing.üëÄ",,10236,"{'like_count': 9762, 'comment_count': 474, 'num_users': 408241}",Da-TRapHouse.TV üì∫üì°üî•üêê(RHTV)‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•,,2023-10-15 21:00:50,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323155475_107551428832790_5074792760666238830_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=f4-4Ncq64uQAX_yKVV8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBUVA4HyJNaBfUwzVWxwp0DjEJY-pCMRw3XLMAg1jXFmg&oe=655AB6D6,https://www.instagram.com/p/CybwxTJSdWt/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392723997_846769347236482_3025931364234661847_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=cnWDNh37TQwAX8M7Z2S&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCP6QxAMjUvJD5R1RNaXIJ6sDO83_NUi2PLlfww9oBmDQ&oe=65311C17

instagram,"Disclaimer: I DO NOT support or condone Hamas. Nor do I support or condone the actions of Israeli forces. Hamas doesn‚Äôt represent innocent Palestinians. Hamas is an Israeli creation designed to give the illusion there is an equal sided conflict. The reality is, Israel is a military powerhouse backed by big governments and secret societies, with one of the most sophisticated intelligence agencies in the world (Mossad). 

What is happening in Palestine is settler colonialism, military occupation, land theft and ethnic cleansing. A conflict means there is equal footing, which is not the case. There is an active oppressor (Israel) and an oppressed (Palestine). A colonizer (Israel) and a colonized (Palestine). 

This is not a conflict, it‚Äôs only a conflict when you fall for the mainstream media narrative. 

Say anything they don‚Äôt want said about Israel and its treatment of Palestinians or of Zionism and it‚Äôs corruption of Judaism and bang, you‚Äôre anti-Semitic. Just like the same ‚Äòconspiracy theorist‚Äô derogatory label they use to steer people from the truth. Don‚Äôt  let cognitive dissonance takeover whats truly taking place, put aside any pre concieved notions or beliefs, your worldview perception on this topic has been shaped from the mainstream, the same mainstream that is completely controlled and lie to you every single day.

Disagreeing with the policies of another nation does not make you anti-Semitic.

Disagreeing with the Israeli treatment of Palestinians does not make you anti-Semitic.

Disagreeing with the hundreds of millions of lives lost in the name of Political Zionism through genocide, wars, financial manipulation and government corruption does not make you anti-Semitic.

This is about HUMANITY as one, all ethnicities, races, religious beliefs, sexual preferences, financial positions, political views, don‚Äôt allow these fault lines of division to distract you, do not be fooled by the hidden hand that your awake to for one Agenda, but asleep to for another.

‚Å†
The NPR-PBS News Hour-Marist poll found that nearly two in three Americans ‚Äî or roughly 65 percent ‚Äî say the government should publicly support Israel. About 23 percent said the U.S. should say or do nothing related to the conflict, and 8 percent say the U.S. should publicly criticize Israel.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚Å†
Partisanship did not seem to play much of a role in the results, either, according to the poll. Around 77 percent of Republicans, 69 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of independents said they believe the U.S. should show public support for Israel amid the war.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúIsrael is clearly winning in the court of public opinion,‚Äù Lee M. Miringoff, director of Maris College Institute for Public Opinion said in a statement.‚Å†
‚Å†
More than half of Americans also think U.S. support for Israel makes the Middle East safer. This comes as a majority of respondents said they were ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù or ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could lead to a larger conflict in the Middle East, according to the poll.‚Å†

instagram,"‚ÄúWhere is humanity?‚Äù

The images above show only some of the horror, suffering and grief that has unfolded this week, as the latest brutal conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas continues to claim victims.

More than 1,300 people have been killed in Israel, according to the military. More than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed and a further 6,612 wounded by Israeli strikes since Saturday, Gaza‚Äôs health ministry said on Thursday.

The UN‚Äôs human rights office has called for restraint on both sides. However, with nearly half Gaza‚Äôs 2.3 million citizens warned by Israel to evacuate before a likely ground assault ‚Äì an order the UN says will spark 'devastating humanitarian consequences' ‚Äì the tragedy of the last week looks unlikely to end soon.

‚ÄúI want [my family] back ‚Ä¶ want to close my eyes and this was all a nightmare,‚Äù says Yifat Zailer, who has six family members still missing after Hamas‚Äôs attack

‚ÄúForget Islam, Christianity and Judaism, where is humanity?‚Äù said Gaza resident Oummah Thahir, a mother of six.

instagram,"Today, as I reflect on the ongoing conflict between Israel & Palestine, my heart is heavy, not as a Canadian Muslim but as a human being who has always believed in the power of reconciliation & unity.

When someone declares, ""I stand with Israel"" on social media, it is essential to understand the depth & nuances of such a statement. This should not mean a blank cheque of support for the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives‚Äîchildren, women, & the elderly in Gaza or Palestine. Similarly, to say, ""I stand with Palestine"" should not be an endorsement of the actions of extremist factions, Hamas or the harm inflicted upon innocent Jewish lives & people.

But herein lies the challenge in choosing a side, we must always be guided by an informed conscience & a deep understanding of history. Because, in the grand arc of time, it's not about picking popular side or looking cool, but ensuring we find ourselves on the right side of history.

Both the Israeli & Palestinian governments have made choices that are deeply regrettable. Actions that have resulted in loss, pain, death & suffering. Both sides have blemishes in their histories. However, the errors of governments should never be seen as the errors of their people. We cannot allow the mistakes of a few corrupt politicians & extremist to justify the suffering of the many, whether it's through violence, deprivation of basic necessities like electricity, water, & food, or the profound pain of lost loved ones.

At the core of this conflict are two groups of people with more in common than they might realize. Muslims & Jews share profound theological, cultural, & historical ties. We are in many ways, brothers & sisters under the vast canopy of Abrahamic faiths. To see them in conflict is a tragic irony of history.

So, what then is our role? It is a call & demand for peace, understanding, & most importantly, action. We must move past divisive narratives & work towards building bridges. Our focus should be on the innocent lives caught in the crossfire & the future generations who deserve a world of peace & prosperity. Let's make a collective plea for sanity, for love, for understanding. Let us stand united agains",,5441,"{'like_count': 5441, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 172465}",Alex Haditaghi,,2023-10-15 06:20:22,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/306512200_882432866036276_9172572277633010051_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9SrTSdWevy4AX-eIYbd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA9qu5Yw96nUQvIVzSR1rJqaKxA22Rh6oZS5c3ITC15Hg&oe=655ABC15,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyaMAmfuGRh/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391199567_344691881467522_7264922614089111297_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=P_yqEEcm4LIAX_64ZHP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfARnSxro5Sh49i3RrM8jiBk3p16pKKFdOAPvzeb6t97tg&oe=655B28F8

Palestinian civilians across Gaza, already battered by years of conflict, are struggling for survival in the face of an unprecedented Israeli operation against the territory following attacks by#HamasMilitants on Oct 7 that killed at least 1,300 Israelis, most of them civilians. 

Israel has cut off the flow of #food, #medicine, water and #electricity to Gaza, pounded neighbourhoods with airstrikes and told the estimated 10 lakh residents of the north to flee south ahead of Israel‚Äôs planned attack.

At least 2,670 Palestinians have been killed and 9,600 wounded since #Israel launched its deadliest attack on the #Gazastrip on the 9th day of conflict.

Their donation is aimed at providing essential support to those affected by the conflict, with special attention to women, children, and the elderly.

This initiative stems from a recent controversy surrounding ""McDonald's Israel,"" which was reported to be distributing free meals to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). ¬†This revelation sparked a strong reaction in Turkey, prompting calls for a boycott of the fast-food giant within the country.

In response to these developments, McDonald's Turkey issued an official statement to clarify its position. They emphasized their status as a locally-owned business and stressed that there was no operational or organizational connection between McDonald's Turkey and McDonald's Israel.

According to their statement, McDonald's Israel operates independently and is solely responsible for its business and communication decisions.

instagram,"A 6-year-old boy is dead, and his mother seriously wounded after they were both stabbed more than a dozen times due to their Muslim faith Saturday in a Chicago suburb.

Around 11:38 a.m., deputies with the Will County Sheriff's Office responded to a home located near the intersection of S. Lincoln Highway and Lily Cache Road in Plainfield for a report of a stabbing.

A 32-year-old woman had called 9-1-1 and stated her landlord had attacked her with a knife, and that she ran into the bathroom and continued to fight off her attacker as she dialed 9-1-1.

When officers arrived at the scene, they located the suspect ‚Äì identified as 71-year-old Joseph M. Czuba ‚Äì sitting on the ground outside the home with a laceration to his forehead. He was transported to an area hospital for treatment.

Inside the home, in a bedroom, police say they located two victims who had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso, and upper extremities. The 32-year-old woman was hospitalized in serious condition with over a dozen stab wounds to her body. A 6-year-old boy had also suffered 26 stab wounds throughout his body and was pronounced dead at the hospital.

The knife used in the attack was seven inches long and serrated.

Czuba was treated and released from the hospital, and taken by police for questioning. He was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

""Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,"" according to the Will County Sheriff's Office.

The weapon used in this ""heinous crime"" was recovered, police said.

The investigation is ongoing.üëÄ",,4405,"{'like_count': 4034, 'comment_count': 371, 'num_users': 198299}",Da-TRapHouse.TV üèöÔ∏èüì∫üî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üì° (RHTV) üîåü™Ñ,,2023-10-15 21:01:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/370895420_945042686562224_6922206183247979849_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ZsFYxZG9OLMAX_BT0tg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBhmJtIFVB7JBTspJT3IdCtiDosO6Js_QNql9E_II0M0Q&oe=655A8D4E,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cybw0fgSHmb/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391244730_861039802223296_7063149975024711198_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=k9Y0gmMgSqMAX-Fje3X&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAmfsisbyJNBnoA6E22uE9PCh_60KrCXPxUdx9USLegBw&oe=653384B3

instagram,"There's no doubt about it ‚Äî Madonna is still the reigning Queen of Pop.

The Material Girl kicked off her long-awaited Celebration Tour at London's O2 Arena with an electrifying two-hour set that had the audience of 20,000 up on their feet for the duration of the show.

In a sweet moment, the star paid tribute to her daughter Lourdes ‚Äî who turned 27 on Saturday ‚Äî by leading the audience in a singalong of her song ""Little Star.""

instagram,"Our dream is Disneyland, their ultimate dream is their own land. ‚ú®

Being an Arab raised on Disney movies, it deeply troubles me that Disney has chosen to align itself with one side in the ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel. I firmly believe that entities focused on children and businesses targeting young audiences should refrain from taking a stance in matters of war.

The right of children to live should be cherished above all else, more important than any religious or political stance. For one day, Israel experienced a taste of what Palestinians have endured for 75 years on a daily basis. However, they often fail to acknowledge that their government and people are the oppressors.

P.S. This post was created nearly 7 years ago, just to emphasize that over this span of time, our message has remained consistent and unwavering, it's the exact same message over and over again.

Additionally, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin disclosed that the warships are a representation of the US commitment to maintaining Israel's security rather than being involved in Israel's operations or the combat in Gaza.

The deployments highlight the US goal of deterring any actions, whether from states or non-state actors, that could further escalate the conflict.

As a Lebanese born Canadian, I and my family still carry the weight of that experience, understanding the paralyzing fear, heart-wrenching uncertainty, and trauma that lingers. It's a haunting reminder of the nightmares that conflict can unleash.

Having lived through that dark chapter, I find it especially terrifying to see history repeating itself, to see innocent children, families, and communities being subjected to aggression and killing. I understand intimately the generational impact of such violence, and it fills me with a deep sense of urgency to advocate for peace for all innocent Palestinian and Israeli civilians.

My heart is with all the innocent victims in this conflict. Period. There's an urgent deep concern as we bear witness to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
I pray for the strength of those who continue to endure and my heart reaches out to all who struggle during this unprecedented time.

instagram,"Five days into the bloody situation in Israel and Gaza, the Indian government‚Äôs only response was one tweet from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Put out on October 7, it has over 27 million views and was lacking in nuance ‚Äì describing the attacks by Hamas as ‚Äúterrorist attacks‚Äù, and expressing solidarity with Israel. The Foreign Ministry and External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishanker had simply retweeted the prime minister‚Äôs tweet and left it at that.

Now, six days into the conflict, we have finally heard from the EAM spokesperson. But yet again, there is no direct re-assertion of India‚Äôs support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The statement makes no mention of the loss of Palestinian lives in the ongoing conflict. Without naming Israel, it just talks about the ‚Äúobligation to observe international humanitarian law‚Äù. The only attempt at striking a balance comes from mentioning the need to resume talks to establish a ‚Äúviable State of Palestine‚Äù.

And even this statement, that offers little to the Palestinian people, seems to be consciously delayed. It‚Äôs the immediate solidarity shown with Israel, by way of the tweet and the phone call made by Prime Minister Modi to Benjamin Netanyahu, which again emphasised that ‚ÄúIndia stands firmly with Israel‚Äù, that has registered as India‚Äôs essential response.

The fear is that this lack of nuance may have been intended, and that the Indian government may have erred in doing so.

instagram,"Palestine Day of Resistance on October 13, 2023 in New York City

Thousands showed up in support of Palestine in defense of liberation, justice, and freedom for the Palestinian people. On the other side, there was a small counter protest of Zionists. 

The protest had an intense police presence with drones, helicopter and SRG (strategic response group) - the ‚Äúcounter terrorism unit‚Äù of the NYPD following the entire time. 

*Important to note, the US and Israel have exchanged tactics in violence and control, for decades, NYPD even has Israel Police headquarters in Kfar Saba. The United States committed over $3.3 billion in foreign assistance to Israel in 2022, which accounts for about 16 percent of Israel‚Äôs total military budget.

After 75 years of settler colonial occupation, Israel is commiting a genocide 

Israel told Gaza to flee through the Egyption border, but then bombed them. Then told 1.1 people in North Gaza to go to the South, & bombed civilians on the route they were told were safe. Israel claims every person in Gaza is guilty.  More than 50 percent of Gaza's population is children. As of this post 75 families  has been crossed of the have been crossed off their civil registry.

Israel has it has dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza. Israel is also using white phosphorus, which is a chemical gas that causes severe burns, often down to the bone, that is illegal under international law.

It's not a complicated conflict, it is one where the West has encouraged people to believe resistance is ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù and allow a genocide aginst a settler colonial occupation who has no army.",,3170,"{'like_count': 3139, 'comment_count': 31, 'num_users': 27150}",Brenna Lip,,2023-10-15 22:28:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/311637472_3492816777620719_504435202924295305_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=1ZO7_gkkBBkAX-WVjMX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBOMV8wKCvY9diD9ygguGg1-X4gw1HINJZyhVXIX266Hg&oe=655AF88F,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyb6w5KLhsJ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391464936_314999884595127_5993326229850510094_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=1QTEe6VC0wwAX-dpSLQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAd4rOc4DHXe_U7b9iIvNmWkHK3yZUNyygPIXSGGJ95cg&oe=65593247

‚úä Noussair Mazraoui on his pro-Palestine posts on IG:

""First of all I would like to say it's really disappointing that I have to explain what I stand for. There's a situation out there where thousands of innocent people are being murdered""

""My position is that I will work for peace and justice in this world. This means that I will always be against all kinds of terrorism, hatred and violence. And that‚Äôs something I will always stand behind""

""That's why I don't understand why people think the opposite about me and why I'm associated with hateful groups. Today is not about what I think or what you think, innocent people are being killed every day by this terrible conflict that has gotten out of hand. We all need to be against it and speak out against it. This is just inhumane""

""Finally, I would like to make it clear that it was never my intention to offend or hurt anyone, consciously or unconsciously""

instagram,"A 6-year-old boy was killed and a woman critically injured when they were stabbed by a man who targeted them because they were Muslim in southwest suburban Plainfield Township, police said.

The woman, 32, called 911 Saturday morning and told dispatchers that her landlord was attacking her with a knife, the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Department said. Police found the woman and the boy, 6, with multiple stab wounds ‚Äî the boy had 26 stab wounds, according to an autopsy.

They were both transported to a nearby hospital, where the boy was pronounced dead. The woman was in serious condition, according to Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations-Chicago. 

Police found the suspect, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba, outside the residence and took him into custody. Czuba was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of a hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. 

Authorities said both victims were attacked because of their religion and the war in Israel.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs department said.

instagram,"New Delhi: In the midst of the worsening Israel-Palestine conflict, football, a sport celebrated for its universal appeal, has found itself trapped in political controversy and division. The conflict‚Äôs deep-rooted tensions have transcended international borders, affecting players, fans, and sports organisations.

The FIFA World Cup hosted by Qatar last year witnessed a show of pro-Palestinian solidarity. The most significant being the celebration by Morocco‚Äôs players after their historic win against Spain to enter the quarter-finals of the World Cup. After the win, players celebrated by raising the Palestinian flag. Fans displayed ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù signs in the stands and on stadium walls. In another instance during the France-Tunisia game, a fan managed to get onto the field, waving the Palestinian flag.

The stadiums in Qatar during the World Cup found a place for Palestinian flags, fans came wearing Palestinian armbands and black-and-white headdresses. Some Israeli TV reporters faced open hostility. FIFA struggled to hold the line between sports and politics.

Now, a year on, with a battle raging, football is again on the frontline.

To stop giving your power away and to speak your truth.
It‚Äôs time to set your intentions to how you want to be in your relationships.
What qualities do you associate with Libra? Balance, harmony, committed partnership, fairness, beauty, open-mindedness, justice, nonviolent communication, diplomacy and peacefulness probably come to mind.
But Libra also has a shadow side. The co dependent, indecisive, not speaking its truth therefore creating passive/aggressive reactions. Libra also has the need for external validation and the darker qualities of its polarity, Aries: selfish, reckless and ruthless competitiveness. The war lord, ruled by Mars.
Mars just entered Scorpio, while the portal for balance and peace is open. Mars in Scorpio is relentless, laser focused and ruthless about getting his way.
So on the one hand we have an energy that is asking for peace and balance, and on the other hand we have an energy of darkness and conflict.
How can we bridge the gaps between these opposing energies?
Between us and others?
What is justice?
What is fairness?
Can we bring peace and harmony into our relationships?
It all starts deep within our consciousness, our beliefs.

instagram,"Koreans are divided over the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas, with people expressing differing views on the root cause of Hamas' attack and which side is responsible for the current violence in the Middle East.

On Sunday afternoon, around 200 people gathered in the streets of central Seoul's Itaewon neighborhood, calling for an end to Israel's military action, in a rally organized by the Workers‚Äô Solidarity Youth Group. It was the second pro-Palestine protest organized by the progressive youth group after the first one at Gwanghwamun, downtown Seoul, last Wednesday.

""Today's rally was organized together with Palestinian residents living in Korea, and joined by Korean and foreign residents who support Palestine in its fight against Israel,"" Park Hye-shin, a member of the activist group, told The Korea Times.

The participants marched down the street chanting ""Free Palestine!"" and demanding the Israeli government stop its military action in the Gaza Strip.

instagram,"Iconography as POETRY | ‚ÄúThe painting of images in the Greek artistic tradition is generally similar to writing and much closer to poetic art. This is because, in this tradition, painting was not understood as an objective, correct representation of the randomness of the reality of phenomena but as an attempt to reconstruct the world based on an inner reason. In this way, an image, a true jewel of the world, is presented to the Church of the community.
The images, therefore, come from within, from the mind and soul of the artist; they are not just a matter of the eye but ""mental assumptions."" They are not mechanical ""correct constructions"" that coldly represent reality. Even if the forms used by art mimetically simulated the world of phenomena (Hellenistic naturalism), what constituted the image was its inner origin, i.e., the artist's person.
Based on these data, we can say that in the Greek artistic tradition, the image was, and remained until the end, i.e., until the folk painter Theophilos, writing, a poetic record that describes phenomena, conveys information, ideas, and emotions, the drama and joy of life, but above all the life experience of the writing poet.
Painting in the Greek tradition is a poetic event in lines and colors.
Inherent in this Greek visual tradition was the art of church icons (what we now call iconography).
Thus, the iconographers - hagiographers - write images that are not ""naturalistic"" portraits, showing cold and objective phenomena, but pictures of inner progress, poetic events that record persons and things within an experience of the Church, within an understanding of ""communion in paradise."" ~ George Kordis

instagram,"Tiger II ""234"" of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion during Operation Panzerfaust in Budapest, Hungary, October 15th or 16th, 1944. 79 years ago today, Germany launched Operation Panzerfaust to depose the Hungarian Regent, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, and replace him with the pro-German Arrow Cross Party, after Horthy announced the armistice with the Soviet Union in a nationwide radio address.

On November 20, 1940, Hungary became the fourth member to join the Axis powers. But in 1944, there were growing concerns within the German regime about Hungary's potential for negotiating a separate peace with the Allies or switching sides in the war. In March 1944,¬†Hungary¬†was invaded and occupied by German troops as part of Operation Margarethe. A few months later, in October 1944, Horthy made a radio broadcast that an armistice had been signed with the Soviet Union.

To maintain control over Hungary, A. H. ordered Operation Panzerfaust. The operation was carried out by German commandos led by Otto Skorzeny. On the night of October 15, 1944, Skorzeny and his men infiltrated Budapest, the Hungarian capital. They kidnapped Horthy's son and forced his father to sign a document abdicating his powers, which paved the way for the installation of a new government under the leadership of Ferenc Sz√°lasi, head of the fascist Arrow Cross Party.

Under Sz√°lasi's rule, Hungary became even more closely aligned with Germany and intensified its persecution of Jews and other minority groups. Between November 1944 and February 1945, Sz√°lasi's militias shot 10,000‚Äì15,000 Jews on the banks of the Danube. Although Operation Panzerfaust had severe consequences for Hungary and its population during the remaining months of the conflict, it was a temporary measure.

By the time Operation Panzerfaust took place, Germany was already on the defensive and facing multiple fronts. The Soviet Union's Red Army was advancing toward Hungary, and Budapest would later become the site of a prolonged and brutal siege. The 50-day-long siege of Budapest saw some of the most destructive urban fighting of the war. The city unconditionally surrendered on 13 February 1945.

Here is the truth.
Anyone who defends in a one-sided, politically correct way can‚Äôt try and be neutral  because there aren't two sides to this issue. This is not a matter of politics either, it's a matter of humanity. No one asked for an opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, what was done on Saturday is a terrible terrorist act by Hamas-Isis which is a horrible  and terrible war crime. When acts such as the events of October 7 happen the conflict of which who is right and wrong goes out the window. 
Whoever does not condemn such a criminal act of terrorism, should check himself carefully within his own morals
and remember,
There is a wrong
And there is a right.",,2326,"{'like_count': 2214, 'comment_count': 112, 'num_users': 114373}",Israel Atias,,2023-10-15 20:14:34,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/394105783_697499455659280_1182617676403549129_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=zijhqq0P0p0AX-Bo8S0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA2txwbZTy3OsVMlQTr8nCOH6zd8_9xoV41gRgXXNyXUQ&oe=655A51EF,https://www.instagram.com/p/CybreZwtrI6/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392899573_3604953456491278_6644128755369172345_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0h3kshpnyXcAX9AfxHg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfASAvsOSCz6SZlzXbhVbrfKAQ3AQ_ngFuvAkMXNWf5UJA&oe=655AE344

""Caught in the inertia of abudecay, both silently waited for the other to reach out, unaware that their friendship was fading like the last colors of a sunset.""
„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è‚Å†

The slow erosion of a friendship due to a mutual reluctance to reach out first is a modern-day tragedy of pride and missed opportunities. It's like a silent game of emotional chicken, where each person waits for the other to make the first move, to break the ice that has formed from weeks or months of non-communication. Both parties might even spend moments wondering about the other, yet this curiosity or concern never translates into action. The longer the silence stretches, the more loaded that first outreach becomes, accumulating a weight of expectations and fears‚Äîwhat if they don't respond? What if things aren't the same? In this hesitance, what was once a thriving connection withers into a fading photograph, capturing a moment of joy that seems increasingly remote.

Ironically, this kind of friendship attrition often occurs not because of a major falling-out, but rather due to a collection of minor inactions that accumulate over time. And therein lies the real sorrow: the recognition that something meaningful was lost not in a blaze of conflict, but in a slow burn of neglect. This phenomenon serves as a sobering reminder of the active role we must play in maintaining our relationships. Friendships, like plants, require regular attention and nourishment. The tragedy isn't just in the friendship that has fizzled out; it's also in acknowledging that it might have thrived if only someone had taken that first, simple step. To reach out first is not just an act of communication; it's an act of courage, a declaration that the relationship holds value, deserving to be saved from the slow creep of indifference.

A renowned CNN Correspondent Sara Sidner, has issued an apology following a controversial statement she made during a live broadcast stating that the Israeli Prime Minister's office had confirmed that the Hamas had beheaded babies in Israel.
In her apology, Sidner acknowledged the need for caution and precision when reporting such sensitive and disturbing information. She admitted that her previous statement, suggesting that the Israeli Prime Minister's office must have proof if they were confirming these acts of the Hamas beheading babies, was not an appropriate choice of words.
‚ÄúYesterday the Israeli Prime Minister's office said that it had confirmed Hamas beheaded babies & children while we were live on the air. The Israeli government now says today it CANNOT confirm babies were beheaded, ‚Äú she tweeted adding that ‚ÄúI needed to be more careful with my words and I am sorry. The words I used were the PM's office must have proof if they are confirming this. Then President Biden confirmed seeing it. And then backed tracked,"" she said.
Many leading social media activists have called for her resignation over the misinformation and have demanded accurate reporting over the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.

instagram,"#OTD in 1951, the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge concluded, marking the end of a grueling month-long conflict during the Korean War. Spanning from September 13th to October 15th, this battle unfolded along a winding front line running east to west, a few miles north of the 38th parallel, through the heart of the Korean peninsula.

UN and communist forces, engaged in a series of intense and bloody clashes as they jockeyed for control of the twisting terrain. After a relentless 30 days of combat, American and French forces ultimately gained the upper hand, successfully securing Heartbreak Ridge. However, this achievement came at a considerable cost.

Despite their triumph, Sherman tanks struggled to advance through the treacherous Mundung-ni Valley, with 38 armored vehicles destroyed and nine damaged in the process. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, with over 3,700 American and French soldiers lost and an estimated 25,000 North Korean and Chinese casualties.

The profound impact of these losses resonated deeply with the UN and US command, leading to a strategic shift. They recognized that battles like Heartbreak Ridge, though significant, often came at too high a human toll for the relatively modest territorial gains achieved. This realization prompted a shift toward more cautious and deliberate tactics involving air support, artillery, and infantry, culminating in the eventual capture of Heartbreak Ridge in October 1951.

instagram,"Today our hearts are heavy and burdened as we bear witness to the devastating events unfolding in the Middle East.

We ask you to join us in a moment of silence, to hold space for the profound grief and pain caused by the widespread destruction and degeneration of people and landscapes. We mourn the lives lost on all sides of this tragedy that continues to unfold. 

At Farmers Footprint, we stand firmly committed to inspiring will and building capacity to collectively accelerate regenerative food systems. We understand that a regenerative future can only be realized in a world where peace prevails and where we acknowledge that the health of our planet and humanity are intrinsically intertwined. The deliberate destruction of people, place, homes, culture, agricultural lands, water, and soil is an affront to the very essence of regenerative principles.

As @theslowfactory poignantly reminds us, ""war is both a human rights and a climate disaster."" Today, on World Food Day, we acknowledge the great loss of humanity caused by unrest, as well as the complete devastation of the ecology that supports life in these regions, including their food systems. Food and access to it is a gift, yet the  stark reality is that in regions affected by conflict, food becomes a weapon, a tool of oppression used to starve communities. The devastating impact of war reaches far beyond human lives, decimating the natural world of which we are an extension of. When we scar the earth, we scar ourselves. 

Through these situations, we are shown how food, health, regeneration, war, violence, starvation, and environmental destruction are interconnected. 

In these moments of darkness we strive for a better future, one where we radically reimagine new systems that focus on humanity and nature as a pathway towards peace. Today, may the innocent find solace and safety, and may we collectively work towards a world where the healing of both people and planet takes precedence over destruction. In the midst of darkness, light persists.

instagram,"""Today the path of peace, which Saint Paul VI called by the new name of 'integral development', remains sadly distant from the real lives of many men and women and thus from our human family, which is now entirely interconnected. Despite numerous efforts aimed at constructive dialogue between nations, the deafening noise of war and conflict is intensifying. 

While diseases of pandemic proportions are spreading, the effects of climate change and environmental degradation are worsening, the tragedy of hunger and thirst is increasing, and an economic model based on individualism rather than on solidary sharing continues to prevail. As in the days of the prophets of old, so in our own day the cry of the poor and the cry of the earth constantly make themselves heard, pleading for justice and peace.

In every age, peace is both a gift from on high and the fruit of a shared commitment. Indeed, we can speak of an 'architecture' of peace, to which different institutions of society contribute, and an 'art' of peace that directly involves each one of us. All can work together to build a more peaceful world, starting from the hearts of individuals and relationships in the family, then within society and with the environment, and all the way up to relationships between peoples and nations."" - Pope Francis, from his message on World Day of Peace, 1 January 2022)

‚Ä¢ PSU Banks
PSU bank shares are impacted because of India's war-driven inflation. üí∏

They had a strong year due to improving fundamentals and low-interest rates.üí∞
 
However, if high crude oil prices sustain inflation, the RBI might increase rates. üìà

‚Ä¢ Paint Stocks
Paint sector stocks are down as crude oil price hikes negatively impact their margins. ü´£

Since crude oil derivatives are key paint ingredients, companies have no control over input prices, leading to profit challenges during oil price increases. üí∏

The recent Brent crude price rise was seen as temporary, but ongoing conflict could sustain higher oil prices, posing a long-term threat to the paint sector's profitability. üöß

instagram,"North Sinai, EGYPT - OCTOBER 15: Aid convoy trucks loaded with supplies are seen near to North Sinai Governorate building at Arish City waiting to open the Gaza-Egypt border on 15 October, 2023 in North Sinai, Egypt. The aid convoy, organized by a group of Egyptian NGOs, set off today from Cairo for the Gaza-Egypt border crossing at Rafah. On October 7th, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on border communities in southern Israel, spurring the most violent flare-up of the Israel-Palestine conflict in decades. Israel launched a vast bombing campaign in retaliation and has warned of an imminent ground invasion. (Photo by Mahmoud Khaled/Getty Images)

instagram,"What happened: McDonald's Israel has sparked a global controversy by announcing its decision to provide thousands of free meals to the Israel Defence Forces and citizens during the ongoing conflict with Hamas. #BoycottMcdonalds started trending on Twitter after this, and the food chain has faced much backlash.

Details: Despite the controversy, McDonald's hasn't stopped. They have donated thousands of meals to various groups, including IDF units, the police, hospitals, residents near the conflict zone, and other rescue forces. In addition, the company is offering a 50% discount to soldiers and security forces visiting their branches. McDonald's Israel has established five restaurants dedicated solely to aid and donations for security forces, with plans to deliver 4,000 meals daily. The conflict between Israel and Hamas, triggered by rocket attacks, has resulted in hundreds of casualties and escalating tensions. The death toll has surpassed 1,300 in Israel and over 1,400 in Gaza.

instagram,"Adding to unease among South Koreans in a conflict-ridden world this year is the recent full-blown war that broke out between Hamas and Israel early this month.

Palestinian militant group Hamas initiated large-scale land and air attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7. In response, Israel declared a state of war against Hamas and launched retaliatory airstrikes on Palestinian territory.

The situation resonates with South Korea, where tensions persist between the two Koreas, marked by intermittent skirmishes and military incidents over the past decades. 

""The Israel-Hamas conflict brings back memories of the fear elicited by air raid sirens and text message warnings sent this May,"" said Oh, a Korea Air Force retiree in his 30s, referring to false evacuation warnings sent by the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

instagram,"One thing I know is that a devastating loss brings about so much change. Life changes in ways people don't see coming.

Stories change in dramatic ways and the grieving are forced to rewrite their personal stories and it can feel unsettling and scary to rewrite a story that now carries so much pain and doesn't seem to have a clear ending in sight.

The early days, weeks, and months after loss and when the weight of grief is so heavy can feel impossible to navigate. Emotions are running wild and often conflict with one another and quite honestly, the shock of loss can leave people feeling lost and numb for a very long time.

Grievers will often struggle to function at the same level as before the loss and to face rewriting their personal story that looks nothing like it did before is overwhelming and exhausting.

Self-care is so important after loss. It's important to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and remember to eat as healthy as you can.

It's important to take breaks from the heaviness of grief even if it's just for five minutes at a time.

Know your limitations and remember it's okay to set boundaries. Boundaries that protect your heart and honor the exhaustion you are carrying from one day to the next.

Be kind and compassionate with yourself and especially when you're feeling like no one else understands all you're going through.

Do something special just for you and yes, it's important to let yourself feel and grieve.

I know you're hurting and I know life after loss feels difficult and hard. I know it can feel overwhelming to try and rewrite a story that looks nothing like the one you had planned on and dreamed about.

Hold on and be gentle with your grieving soul as you find ways to rebuild. With time, the fog will clear and you will find your footing inside of the grief again.

I'm always here to listen and I read every comment you share. Sending love. Always.

Luke 19:13 ¬†
‚ÄúAnd he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.‚Äù
This week I have been in several conversations about the conflict in Gaza and the horrific attack on Israel. A continual barrage of missiles has invoked the law of physics, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The disdainful, degrading inhuman encounters and blindsided terroristic actions have caused innocent men, women, and children to lose their lives due to others demented disgruntled thinking, driven by an agenda full of greed, disrespect, and self-indulgence.
Our world is shaken and rightfully so. What is the ripple effect? When is enough, enough? Spiritual wickedness in high places is immediately pointing fingers at one another trying to place blame on each other to gain preeminence, position, and leverage for their own agenda. ¬†
Uninformed accusationalists (if that is a word) are trying to bring rationalization to an ever increasing problem in our world, the world of being uniformed. This conflict that only the Prince of Peace can resolve started with the act of Abram and Sarai not listening to the promise of God. The loss of focus on the promise of God has caused a great strain on many. ¬†
Many questions have arose this week due to the upheaval in Gaza. Questions only God has the answer to. Is Jesus about to come? Will this reveal the Antichrist? Will this open the door to the temple being rebuilt? All of these things could take place. ¬†
In Luke 19 Jesus gives instruction in a parable of what we are to do. Occupy until He comes. Take note, Occupy is capitalized. Occupy, takeover, establish, do business, busy yourself. Prayer warrior, keep on praying. Pastor, keep on pastoring. Preacher, keep on preaching. Evangelist, keep on evangelizing. Singer, keep on singing. Father and mother, keep on parenting. Teacher, keep on teaching. Businessman, keep on doing business. ¬†
Our prayer for you this week: May you keep focused on the command of Jesus and ‚ÄúOccupy‚Äù.

instagram,"via @blackpeoplesunion 
Israel is an apartheid settler colony and Gaza is an open-air prison where half the population are children. Over 2 million Palestinians are trapped in Gaza. Most Gazans are refugees, the survivors of ethnic cleansing across the rest of Palestine. 
Israel regularly bombs Gaza, and maintains complete control over the strip, including all its energy, its trade, its water, its electricity - all of which they regularly cut. 
Israel often speaks of ""wiping out"" the remaining Palestinian population, their genocidal aspirations on full display every single day. Two years ago, Israel massacred over 60 children during Palestinian protests, we will never forget. 
Nor will we forget the other 6500+ Palestinian lives taken in this conflict since 2008, or the untold numbers before the UN started counting.

Israel is the terrorist and Palestinians have the right to defend themselves by any means necessary. Armed struggle is a legitimate mode of resistance for any oppressed people. 
The steadfastness of the Palestinian resistance is incredible and the BPU is unwavering in its support and commitment to Palestinian liberation by any means necessary.

instagram,"A pro-Palestinian group has vandalised the BBC's Broadcasting House headquarters in London with red paint. 

BBC presenter Victoria Derbyshire took to X sharing images and a video of the painted exterior yesterday, captioning it, ‚ÄúJust arrived at work. This is the front entrance to BBC this morning.‚Äù

The group, Palestine Action, has claimed responsibility for the protest, accusing the broadcaster of having ‚Äúblood on its hands‚Äù due to its coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict. 

In addition to the London headquarters, the group also targeted the BBC's Hanover Building in Liverpool, once again using red paint to symbolise its alleged complicity in Palestinian suffering.

""Palestine Action sent a message to the BBC overnight: propagating false narratives and endorsing Israel's war crimes means you bear responsibility for Palestinian suffering #ShutBBCDown,‚Äù the group expressed via X.

The Metropolitan Police clarified that there is no indication connecting the incident to a protest group and no arrests have been made.

instagram,"There is only one thing in life we need besides food, water, and shelter. Love.  Israel should throw out Netanyahu. Investigate and impeach him for the greatest security breach/incompetence in history. They should mourn the loss and celebrate the lives of those who were murdered. Israel should secure its borders. Bolster its defenses, then focus on negotiations to get hostages back to Israel. Israel should ask for assistance from our future allies in the region. Primarily Saudi Arabia.  Hamas should be struck off the list as a viable political representative of the People of Palestine to be negotiated with. There should be no safe harbor to Hamas, who has terrorized both Israel and, more importantly, its own people who have become its victims. Israel can not be in a war because wars are fought between legitimate states.  Israel is fighting a very successful counter insurgency orchestrated by a radical terrorist group. De escalation of conflict should be first order. How can you rely on Netanyahu to solve the problem when he got us here in the first place. Show good faith, withdraw from settlements, and restrain right-wing elements of the Israeli government.  Any Israeli politician past or present talking calously of the loss of innocent lives should be censored.  Women and children should be provided safe harbor and all protections according to international law. Whatever the hell that means anymore. Restraint. Not Revenge. Wisdom. Not carelessness. Right, not might.  At some point, someone has to say enough is enough and show humanity.  Evil is a self-replicating virus that hosts on the hunger of human stupidity. I love you all. Israelis. Jews. Palestinians. Muslims. Russians. Ukrainians. Chinese. Indians. Saudis.  Iranians. Americans. Republicans. Democrats. And everyone in between.

instagram,"I love this sentiment that I learned from @traumaattachmenttraining ‚Äî> secure attachment is a behavior rather than a fixed quality and we are all born securely attached ‚ù§Ô∏è

This instinct gets lost, however, when you have injurious experiences with caregivers & attachment figures, resulting in enmeshed boundaries (anxious attachment), hardened boundaries (avoidant attachment), or disorganized boundaries (a mixture of the two).
 
A guiding question to help recover this capacity is as follows: ‚ÄúWhat  securely attached response can I choose?‚Äù

Secure attachment looks like‚Ä¶

‚ú®Owning and communicating your needs and feelings assertively & kindly
‚ú®Demonstrating consideration & curiosity for loved one‚Äôs‚Äô feelings & needs
‚ú®Practicing repair instead of stonewalling or fawning
‚ú®Practicing positive conflict resolution strategies instead of shutting down or blaming

Thinking about secure attachment as a behavior rather than a fixed quality can help you find more agency & resilience in engaging in secure attachment patterns.

instagram,"Envy, jealousy and anger at someone else‚Äôs success comes from competitiveness and the pettiness of the ego.

The ego is small and limited. Being as such it only feels satisfied by seeing someone fall while seeing itself rise. It gains security through shallow experiences and superficial possessions. That is the nature of the ego. There is nothing to be done about it, other than observing and understanding it.

When the egoic process subsides, which may happen only if the ego understands itself, and therefore cannot carry out its own intentions, then something else begins to make decisions in our lives.

That something else is free from deep-seated fear and therefore also devoid of the violence and hate arising out of that fear. It isn‚Äôt self-seeking in nature.  It derives happiness, pleasure and beauty from its own inward lack of conflict. Clarity itself is the source of its security and happiness. No object, or possession or person is central to its happiness.

Such a mind celebrates the success of others. It pushes them forward even if it itself remains behind. It cares not about who overtakes it or becomes more powerful, for power and influence have no importance in its life, only beauty and love does, to which it has unhindered access.

To have such a mind requires us to let go of the rejection and embarrassment of envy too. It requires us to be at peace with it and observe it unfold and reveal its secrets. How trivial it‚Äôs demands tend to be. When we catch ourselves with these thoughts they weaken and subside.

This unraveling ends in only one place -  a place of deep understanding of what it means to suffer, a place of compassion and empathy towards all human beings, and in partaking in others happiness and suffering without hesitation or holding back.

There is always more to see. The path leads inwards.

instagram,"As parents, we profoundly influence how our kids navigate conflict. Our reactions become their blueprint for handling difficult situations. 

When we respond to them harshly and loudly, we unintentionally teach them to mirror those reactions. But there is another way. üß°

Let's choose the path of patience, empathy, and understanding. 

When we show children that conflict can be resolved peacefully, we empower them to become compassionate problem solvers. Through our gentle guidance, they learn the value of listening, compromise and finding common ground.

instagram,"PLAINFIELD, IL- A landlord has been arrested for attacking a mother in son in a home this morning.

The boy, who was stabbed 26 times with a serrated knife with a seven-inch blade, was pronounced dead at a hospital, according to the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office in Joliet, Ill.

The boy‚Äôs mother, 32, was in serious condition with more than a dozen stab wounds, officials said. She was expected to survive. The authorities did not publicly identify the victims.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the Sheriff‚Äôs Office said.

The man accused in the attack, Joseph M. Czuba, 71, was the landlord of the home the family was renting, the Sheriff‚Äôs Office said. He has been charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of a hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon in what the Sheriff‚Äôs Office described as a ‚Äúsenseless and cowardly act of violence.‚Äù

citing text messages the boy‚Äôs mother sent to his father from the hospital that were shared with the advocacy group, said the landlord had been angry with what he was seeing on the news.

According to the text messages, the landlord knocked on the door, and when the mother opened it he tried to choke her and attacked her with a knife, yelling, ‚ÄúY*u M*sl*ms must ***!‚Äù

When she ran into the bathroom to call 911, the text messages say, she came out to find that he had stabbed her son.

‚ÄúIt all happened in seconds,‚Äù she texted, according to CAIR.

When deputies arrived before noon at the residence in Plainfield Township, which is about 40 miles southwest of Chicago, they found Mr. Czuba ‚Äúsitting upright outside on the ground‚Äù by the driveway of the residence, the Sheriff‚Äôs Office said.

Mr. Czuba, who had a cut to his forehead, was taken to a hospital and later taken to the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. #israel #palestine #gaza #chicago #illinois #freepalestine",,755,"{'like_count': 663, 'comment_count': 92, 'num_users': 6326}",,,2023-10-15 21:59:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/67264040_442809729650463_4711175624419442688_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=tyR_9hpB1g0AX_V9G3u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCua7jvP29llO8Q5vQqM9LW9CvMcZ7Sjfin1pyEqnzCIQ&oe=6559DFE4,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyb3dCnvwlI/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391115434_833118494973069_4913732195403393115_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ujHOupoWbO8AX-IGnYQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAJZ6LCdATcdD-KfXozQTbWWKe_m3R3e5Qx_r-EExqAPA&oe=653549E8

It was bound to happen and now it has. This is 6 year old Wadea Al Fayoume. A landlord in Chicago expressing anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian views broke into this young boys apartment and attacked his family with a knife, injuring the mother and killing the boy.

For the last week, as some of have been warning, the rise in anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic rhetoric was reaching fever pitch in our media and among our elected officials. 

Those same officials have rightfully addressed the fears and concerns of our Jewish communities but they have all but neglected to condemn this vile hate against Arabs, Palestinians and Muslims ripping through our society.",,714,"{'like_count': 671, 'comment_count': 43, 'num_users': 67352}",Javier MunÃÉoz,,2023-10-15 23:32:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/395601739_353767867038409_5575887404739208113_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=eLzWJF9T3aYAX-QelFM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAT2tyHJpQylqxXbwRVaKoZcx4kycax8T6OixbR2MgF6w&oe=6559F962,https://www.instagram.com/p/CycCJVIPceo/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390927310_870296614708298_2594080448677336178_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=y22HEJtZ6tgAX_OS_7B&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBm8RzA8KWjJo8xf8NgtPXjI6O8hYNtOdoLO2BVuNHvXw&oe=655A5238

instagram,"Latest on the #Israel-Hamas War:

Key Takeaways:

1. #Hamas continued its ground and rocket attacks into Israel, primarily southern Israel. Palestinian militants are continuing limited attempts to infiltrate southern Israel via land and sea.

2. Clashes in the West Bank between Israeli forces and Palestinian militias decreased after peaking on October 13. Hamas remains committed to expanding the war to the West Bank, however.

3. Lebanese #Hezbollah claimed attacks on the IDF for the second consecutive day as part of its ongoing harassment of Israeli forces. LH messaging indicates that the group will conduct additional attacks against Israeli forces in the coming days.

During the six day period, Israel has dropped 6,000 b‚àÖmbs on the Gaza Strip, the same amount that was dropped in Afghanistan in one year that also displaced a total of over 3.5 million people.

The United Nations with data dating back to 2008, finds the substantial casualties are much higher in regards to the Palestinians. Estimates even before 2008 are said to be in the millions during the 75 year conflict.

By 2020, 5,590 Palestinians had been killed, and 115,000 had been wounded, while in Israel, 291 people were killed and 5,600 were injured during the same period.

Additionally, Israels further displacement of the Palestinians created and contributed to the refugee crisis with 700,000 Palestinians initially displaced from their homes, and their descendants now residing as six million refugees within 58 densely populated settlements throughout Palestine and in neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt.

The Israeli IDF is continuing to escalate the situation by striking Syrian Airports and deploying white phosphorus on Lebanon which is a war crime. 724 children and 458 women among the 2,215 Palestinians were k!lled in eight days in Gaza.

Water has ran out for 2 million people in Gaza with no humanitarian supplies into Gaza.

instagram,"Editorial: THE ongoing conflict in Palestine has brought out the worst amongst many self-professed democrats in the West, as they have cheered on Israel‚Äôs excesses, and participated in the dehumanisation of the Palestinians.

Particularly galling are efforts by the US administration to block a ceasefire and give Gaza‚Äôs besieged population a breather. When asked recently about calls for a ceasefire, the White House press secretary termed these calls ‚Äúrepugnant ‚Ä¶ and disgraceful‚Äù.

Moreover, as reported in the American media, a State Department memo has advised US diplomats against using phrases such as ‚Äúrestoring calm, end to violence/ bloodshed‚Äù and ‚Äúde-escalation/ ceasefire‚Äù. From the looks of it, Washington has given Israel the green light to carry on its butchery of the Palestinian people, while drowning out calls for ending the violence.

Other members of the Western fraternity are no better. France has banned pro-Palestine rallies to preserve ‚Äúpublic order‚Äù. Ironically, in the land of libert√©, egalit√© and fraternit√©, these vaunted ideals are out of bounds for Palestinians or those who sympathise with them.

Some spoke up for the investors, the share holders, or the businesspeople, others spoke for people who were displaced by pipelines, or people who suffered health issues. But then things became really interesting when the voices of animals started to speak up, and then the voices of water systems, mountains and weather.

Still though, the arguments were churning on. We could hear and validate points on all sides but there seemed to be no ways to move towards any kind of reconciliation. 

Then - a painfully shy person who had barely spoken all week, a kind of liminal androgynous being who was really hiding at the back of it all, began to quake and shiver and tremble. They rose to their feet and spoke out in a surprisingly huge voice across all the din, fierce and trembling: 

‚ÄúI am the voice of the Earth!‚Äù""

- extract from October's ARTE SALON. 
Released on yesterday‚Äôs New Moon

‚ú®
ARTE SALON is is an indie version of one of those well known subsc ription services - without a third party taking a cut.
‚Äã
Think of this as 'meeting me for a drink' once a month, where I share with you something of my secret inner world: my creative, somatic and spiritual praxis, thought and ritual processes, guided practises, along with poetic musings and fragments of divine inspiration and wonder.
‚Äã
Perhaps it may grow and become something greater,
that powers and gives life to us all.

instagram,"In these times don‚Äôt let the precision of our words overshadow the sincerity of our intentions.

With that said anyone who truly knows me understands my oddly developed appreciation n understanding of the Jewish people and their culture. Growing up in South Florida, I was surrounded by a vibrant community of which I even met some of my earliest ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù

For years we traded traditions and celebrated countless Shabbats, Hanukkahs, n Passovers. Ive worn Kippahs, joined in prayers, and even frequently found the Afikomen for big üí∞ (iykyk). So, please know everything I express is rooted in love, firsthand experiences, and a 'general' understanding.

In 2016, myself and a carefully chosen group took a 10-day journey to Israel to deepen our knowledge of a people who, like the African American and Arab community, have also endured profound challenges throughout history. We explored the entire country, guided by amazing representatives who welcomed our probing questions, even if their answers were as complex as the questions themselves.

Ive stood in Jerusalem where the Jewish and Arab territories meet, feeling the undeniable tensions. Ive driven along the Gaza border, to the sounds of explosions as reminders of the conflict's daily reality.

These recent weeks have weighed heavily on my heart. Seeking answers has only deepened my confusion and inner turmoil. The feeling of helplessness in the face of such a complex situation is overwhelming. Over the years, I've forged countless relationships with remarkable individuals who proudly represent both sides. And I can say unequivocally that the decisions made by Hamas are not reflective of 'my friends,' just as the decisions made by the Israeli government do not define 'my friends.'

I have faith in the moral compass of the people I hold dear. Even when objectivity can understandably be clouded by emotions, families, and lives hanging in the balance. I pray that the purity I've witnessed in their hearts remains steadfast.

Understanding my words won't resurrect those lost or halt bullets flying from either side. Please know where my heart lies and where my hopes for the future reside. üáÆüá±üáµüá∏",,553,"{'like_count': 506, 'comment_count': 47, 'num_users': 12203}",Connecting‚Ä¶,,2023-10-15 12:53:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/336991047_152842644039699_304391838669641142_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=2EjaJHM5nPsAX9-1abV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBygGyJoXC7ef9hyiMQ3_337f-2ma8x08QzT9pt6Hfqvw&oe=6559C27A,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cya5CnWgkR6/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391500205_775978350952668_5969594098448520271_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=plN1NDadhr4AX9yLqtQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBicu16aEcl-FG4nx9dESYA3OPCPhNKY2zKM35RGByiUQ&oe=65591828

instagram,"I've been overwhelmed with messages and calls inquiring about my stance on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. Let me make it clear that I stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people, whose fundamental quest for liberation resonates deeply with the struggles of Black communities all over the country. I'm going to always be Black First. And you can still be Black First and still recognize the humanity in others and join forces to defeat the common enemy, without diminishing your love for your race first. It's disheartening to witness some individuals who claim to champion Black consciousness distancing themselves from this support and claiming it's unrelated to our cause. However, it's essential to recognize that today it's Palestine, and tomorrow it could be Black Americans facing similar challenges. Many of the revolutionary and Black-conscious leaders we often draw inspiration from have a history of standing in unity with the Palestinian people. In the words of Huey P. Newton, ""We must think globally and act locally.""

instagram,"The Pentagon has ordered a second carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, according to two US officials, as Israel prepares to expand its Gaza operations.

The US warships are not intended to join the fighting in Gaza or take part in Israel‚Äôs operations, but the presence of two of the Navy‚Äôs most powerful ships is designed to send a message of deterrence to Iran and Iranian proxies in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The first carrier strike group, led by the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived off the coast of Israel earlier this week.

Now the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower strike group, which deployed Friday from Norfolk, Virginia, is headed to the eastern Mediterranean. 

The aircraft carrier was initially set to move toward the US European Command, but the officials said it will now head for the waters near Israel.

It is unclear at this point how long the Ford will stay in the region once the Eisenhower carrier strike group arrives, one official said.

The Eisenhower is the flagship of the carrier strike group, which will be joined by a guided-missile cruiser and two guided-missile destroyers, according to the Navy.

The Biden administration made clear that the carrier, and its accompanying force, are not there to engage in combat activities on behalf of Israel but rather to deter others from entering the conflict, including Hezbollah. üé≠üé§

It's deeply distressing to witness such violence and suffering, especially when it involves children, adults, and the elderly. The trauma experienced by those directly affected and by those who witness these events is a significant concern. Many organizations work to provide support and assistance to those in conflict zones, and it's important to raise awareness of these issues to encourage empathy and humanitarian action.

instagram,"‚ÄúI appreciated that you used your podcast to share how you are struggling, and have a true moment of silence. FLTR has always been a humanizing force in the running community (elites are just like us), and starting this week's episode in that way was humanizing in a very different sense. You'll probably have some angry folks, because everything on the internet is polarizing.

Maybe that moment of silence needs to stay. It got me to pause, and it probably got others to do the same. Pause, reflect, wonder what they can do differently.‚Äù

I got this (abridged version of a) note from an old colleague and friend. It stopped me square in my tracks and made me think about the words I‚Äôm putting out into internet land. 
Many things can be true at the same time. I firmly support Israel defending itself. I also feel deeply for the extreme loss of life in Gaza, as well as in Israel. I also acknowledge none of us are military experts and probably only know 1% of what‚Äôs going on. At the same time, it does feel like Israel got baited into an overreaction and now the world hates Jews even more because they see Israel and Jews interchangeably. 

Most people don‚Äôt know that most Jews don‚Äôt support the right wing government currently in place in Israel. Most people have never spoken with an Israeli or a Palestinian who lives this struggle every. single. day. 

I don‚Äôt have any answers. I‚Äôm just telling you that if you‚Äôve just learned about this conflict in the last week, please trust that there are plenty of nuances you don‚Äôt know and it‚Äôs not binary. And that most Jews (and Palestinians!) are good people who want the suffering and war to end once and for all. 

I cannot explain to you the pride and privilege I experienced my first (and every) time in Israel. To feel like I truly belonged. To feel that I am welcome, and the part of me that is a minority in just about every place besides synagogue is *welcomed* and not questioned.

Continued in comments, photo from today‚Äôs run where I hammered an all out mile because I needed to feel something physical.

instagram,"Gaza: Preparing for Dawn by Donald Macintyre

Uniquely imprisoned, most Palestinians in Gaza cannot travel beyond the confines of the Strip, and in times of war escape is impossible. They live under siege ‚Äì economic and armed ‚Äì and yet so many remain courageous, outspoken and steadfast. Donald Macintyre lays bare Gaza‚Äôs human tragedy and reveals how it became a crucible of conflict and a byword for suffering. He identifies the repeated failings ‚Äì including those of the international community ‚Äì that have seen countless opportunities for peace pass by. Yet, against all odds, hope for a better future lingers. Gaza was once a flourishing coastal civilization open to the world. Could it be so again?

üèîÔ∏è Meet the Soƒça River, a 137 km long alpine gem with a mysterious karst source in Trenta, right at the foothills of the mighty Julian Alps. Its vivid emerald waters wind through stunning landscapes, making it a true natural treasure of Slovenia. üåç
üåç During World War I, the Soƒça Front witnessed fierce battles between Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces. The riverbanks were a theater of conflict, and the surrounding landscapes bear the scars of that turbulent time.
üìú It was here that renowned Slovenian poet Simon Gregorƒçiƒç found inspiration for his powerful works. His verses, deeply connected to the Soƒça River and the dramatic events of the war, continue to resonate with readers today.
üèîÔ∏è This river's serenity today belies the echoes of the past. It's a place where nature and history intersect, reminding us of the enduring spirit of this region.

instagram,"‚ÄúCan you post the same thing for innocent who are killed in Gaza?‚Äù

I apologise for the delay in addressing this. After the horrific attack last weekend by Hamas terrorists against Israeli citizens, I wrote that the consequences for Palestinians would be dire and unfair. It has already triggered a war in Gaza, where Hamas leadership does not reside, and I feel deep sadness and anger for those innocent Palestinian people trapped in the battle. I cannot accept Hamas‚Äôs vile onslaught as ‚Äújust revenge‚Äù for the decades of apartheid conditions the Gazan people have lived under. Yet, the right-wing factions within the Israeli government urging punishing retaliation must be resisted, too. Revenge is not just; it is cruel and hateful (and it is not Jewish). This war will not produce an outcome to justify the death it causes. Wars bring about brutality, killings and murders outside the rules of conflict. This battle for freedom to exist on a joint homeland is unlikely to end with a peaceful simple resolution, following decades of complexity. Instead, every day we will read of more deaths. Palestinian and Israeli families and friends will each find out their loved ones have been killed. They will bury their dead side by side using exactly the same rituals, as Jews and Muslims are cousins.

Importantly, each victim is innocent, regardless of whether you agree with their politics or not. That is terrorism, it does not discriminate. 

To the Palestinian and Israeli people, and to my Muslim and Jewish friends who I know are grieving, I hope this war ends soonest.

I was sick for the past week and during that time consciously chose to put down my phone, step away from IG and heal my body. 

As I return to this digital community, my mental health is rapidly declining due to the ongoing conflict, lack of humanity, and aggressive energy of people on this platform. 

I believe in being informed and taking action to fight for the liberation of the oppressed. In sharing ways you can help and combatting misinformation. 

I also know that we will not save anyone by constantly checking, responding, passively viewing others hot takes or grand statements.

instagram,"‚ÄúIf you are neutral situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.‚Äù I will use my voice and platform to speak about Palestine and support my homeland. I‚Äôm standing up for those whose voices are silenced by western media. For our martyrs. For the children of Falasteen who did not grow up and experience a beautiful life. For the mothers and fathers who were taken away too quickly from this world. For the elderly, who have been enduring a brutal ethnic cleaning for almost 8 decades.

Many of our parents and grandparents are OLDER THAN THE STATE OF ISRAEL. Let that sink in. My grandparents were FORCED out of their homes at such a young age in 1948. Their parents had to leave their homes, their life, their neighbors, not knowing if they will ever see anyone again. Not knowing if they will ever come back home. 

To say this week has been tough is an understatement. We are watching complete lineages getting wiped out, a mass genocide happening before our eyes. My heart aches for my people. I‚Äôm shattered. Speechless. Angry with the world for framing this genocide as a ‚Äúwar‚Äù and ‚Äúconflict‚Äù. I‚Äôm angry with everyone for not standing up for what‚Äôs right. Yet, I know that my tears and feelings are nothing compared to the pain and tragedy innocent children and families in Gaza have experienced time and time again. Ya Allah, give them sabr. May they be granted the highest level in Jannah ya rab. InshaAllah we live to see a free Palestine in our lifetime ü§≤üèº‚ô•Ô∏èüáµüá∏

instagram,"False Information About Palestine
Has Dire Consequences...
71-year-old man, Joseph Czuba, expressing anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian views, stabbed 6-year-old Muslim child, Wadea Al-Fayoume, to death and injured his mother after breaking into their home in #Chicago.
The Muslim boy had been stabbed 26 times, and his mother had been stabbed more than a dozen times.
The Will county sheriff's office said: ""Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.""

instagram,"As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continued to rage on, Caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani on Sunday equated Israel‚Äôs airstrikes on Gaza and the siege of the territory to conducting genocide against the people of Palestine.

The statement comes after Israel imposed a ‚Äútotal siege‚Äù to stop food and fuel from reaching the enclave of 2.3 million people, many poor and dependent on aid in response to a surprise Hamas offensive last week that left 1,300 Israelis dead, according to officials.

In retaliatory air and artillery strikes, Israeli forces have flattened entire neighbourhoods, hospitals and schools in Gaza. Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since last week have killed at least 2,215 people, including 724 children, the Palestinian territory‚Äôs Hamas-controlled health ministry said on Saturday.

Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the minister noted that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had called an emergency meeting of its executive committee in Jeddah on October 18, adding that he would be in attendance.

instagram,"To all my friends across the sea, people i have worked with, people i love, people who care for humanity you should know what is happening here. 

Never have we ever experienced this kind of cruelty in our history since the holocaust.
A week ago we were attacked by the terror organization Hamas, innocent lives lost in horrifying ways, people who came to dance, to do what we love the most - slaughtered.
While this mass massacre was going on, Hamas kept bombing missiles from gaza to the south of israel and penetrated into the ‚ÄòKibutzim‚Äô, terrorists broke into people homes and killed them in cold blood and horrendous different ways, defiling they‚Äôre bodies, wiping out entire families, burning their homes, raped women and kidnapped civilians into gaza, it‚Äôs disgusting.
All my friends are grieving. 
Everyone lost someone they know.
Its too hard to digest, missiles are still being fired at us from Gaza, every night i go to bed and think about all those faces, about how scared they must of been before they were executed, how they waited for rescue that didn‚Äôt came on time, what‚Äôs happening now throughout the world is terrifying.
Antisemitism is rising and threatening our existence. 
Some of the world is trying to deny that this happened, are they are blind, how can they do that? There is so much evidence online for what happened, they literally filmed themselves doing so! It‚Äôs insane!people outside don‚Äôt understand our conflict and  that Terror is the true problem, they don‚Äôt get it untill it knocks on their door! 
WAKE UP(!)
#hamasisisis 
But They will not put our spirit down, we will dance again.

instagram,"There are no ‚Äúright words‚Äù at a terrible time like this‚Äînot on social media. I refuse to pretend that social media is the real world. It‚Äôs a digital, virtual representation, manipulated by algorithms, controlled by a couple megalomaniac men. Sometimes I feel like this platform isn‚Äôt worthy of our true, heartfelt emotions. But I‚Äôll try to share my feelings here anyhow. 
 
I am utterly devastated by anti-Semitic terrorism. To see this kind of hate in my own lifetime, in my children‚Äôs‚Äô lifetime, is terrifying. The extreme violence and peoples‚Äô willingness to disregard it shows us that anti-Semitism is raging as it always has.
 
The politics and power and hate of the Israel/Palestine conflict is beyond me. I‚Äôm just sharing my feelings as one person. 
 
No people should be oppressed, not anywhere in the world. Seeing children hurt and killed is devastating to see anywhere, in any country, on every continent. I want Palestinian people to be free. I want Israelis to be free. I want human beings around the world to have their basic human rights and be free from war, hunger, and oppression. No countries should ever commit war crimes‚Äîit makes the entire world unsafe. 
 
I just hope that we can all see each other‚Äôs humanity right now. I hope we can all extend to each other love, respect, and patience. I hope we can remember that we‚Äôre witnessing horrors we are not built to withstand. We‚Äôre all doing our best to make sense of this, to take care of ourselves and our loved ones while the unthinkable happens. It‚Äôs so painful to be human, but we can make it a tiny bit easier by extending love to each other. 
 
It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of bravery or effort to post something to social media. It‚Äôs a little digital box on a screen. So besides sitting with our tiny digital windows to the world, watching the screen in horror and rage, I hope we can all use our energy to take long, deep breaths, and give someone a hug or a phone call. Help them feel less alone with the horror. 
 
I‚Äôm sending my sincere love to everyone I know‚Äîwhether you feel detached from everything that‚Äôs going on, or you feel aligned with a ‚Äúside,‚Äù or you feel enraged, or you are just in pain.

instagram,"üíî The current situation in Gaza (Palestine) is truly heart-wrenching! What is unfolding there goes against the principles of international human rights and humanitarian law.

While it is important to combat the heinous terrorist organization of Hamas with full force, it is equally crucial to ensure the protection of civilians, both in times of peace and war.

Sadly, a new generation of innocent Palestinians, like their parents, are being forcibly displaced from their homes and are once again becoming refugees. Their suffering seems never-ending, as Gaza, the largest open-air prison, is tragically turning into a graveyard.

It is imperative for the international community, including the EU, to call on all parties to end violence against all civilians in both Israel and Palestine. This will help pave the way for a two-state solution, where two democratic states can peacefully coexist, ensuring peace and security for all.

Until now, I must say that some in the the EU Commission have failed to stay on the right side of history - side of peace, protection of civilians and anti-extremism - especially the president of the EU Commission @ursulavonderleyen and the Neighborhood Commissioner Oliver V√°rhelyi have been disappointments. Thanks to Vice President- High Representative for Foreign and Security Policies @josep_borrell_f and the Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarƒçiƒç for being the voices of reason during tough times like this.

üëâüèº Also Charles Michel, President of the European Council, is a voice of reason and important actions. Via the link in my bio, you can find his statement and invitation to an emergency meeting with the member states on October 17.

I stand in solidarity with the people of Israel and Palestine, who deserve peace, security, and harmony in their lives ‚ù§Ô∏è",,236,"{'like_count': 211, 'comment_count': 25, 'num_users': 7386}",Evin Incir,,2023-10-15 10:41:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/386638643_351511917344127_9011604212036412692_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=OfSMr89N2t4AX9REEev&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD2zVuFU4Kv2OXZe_Zo9Ghv6sRUSQL0A3nMD8DGgUxuFg&oe=655A1C92,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyap3rrscyV/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391113779_270967172589741_5884334523624323528_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=xQSXCBjkNx0AX-c6-Og&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDY1dOIwJX6aXg8QwVUdmHkKA0az_dFQsjAlGtYS-l2bA&oe=6559CA66

instagram,"ISRAEL'S INTEL FAILURE IS BAD FOR BUSINESS:

The sheer scale and intensity of the Palestinian resistance's Operation Al-Aqsa Flood took Israel and the world by surprise last week. Even seasoned western intelligence agency veterans, who possess intimate knowledge of Israel's surveillance capabilities,¬†struggled¬†to provide any plausible explanation for the glaring security gaps.¬†

Academics with decades of research on the conflict, also admitted they are none the wiser: ‚ÄúHonestly I have no f'ing clue what's going on. What this means. Or where this heads. Literally anything is possible,‚Äù¬†tweeted¬†an Associate Fellow at ‚Äúthe world's oldest and the UK's leading defense and security think tank,‚Äù the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).¬†

US officials were notably¬†evasive¬†when asked if this amounted to an epic ""intelligence failure."" Mainstream news outlets openly¬†pondered¬†how Tel Aviv could have missed the Palestinians' elaborate plans while¬†conspiracy theories quickly spread online to suggest that Israel may have intentionally allowed the incursion to occur - as if the Occupation state ever required an excuse to pulverize Gaza. ¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way, in my view, that Israel did not know what‚Äôs coming‚Ä¶Something is very wrong here...This surprise attack seems like a planned operation on all fronts,‚Äù¬†remarked¬†one former Israeli intelligence officer.

instagram,"In the beautiful dance of life, we often forget that every relationship we forge is like a mirror. 

The joyous moments illuminate our path, revealing the brilliance within us. These interactions remind us of our capacity for love, compassion, and kindness. They affirm that we are beings of light, capable of radiating warmth and positivity into the world ‚òÄÔ∏è

Yet, in the very same mirror, we also encounter our shadows. The moments of tension, conflict, and discomfort act as a stark reminder of our imperfections. They unveil the layers of our fears, insecurities, and unresolved wounds. These shadows can be unsettling, but they are a crucial part of our growth journey üåë

Instead of shying away from our shadows, we should welcome them as opportunities for self-discovery and transformation. 

When we confront our insecurities and fears, we have the chance to heal and evolve. 

So, let's cherish every relationship as a mirror. Let's celebrate the moments of light and use them to inspire and uplift. And let's honor the shadows as teachers, guiding us towards deeper self-awareness and authenticity üíñ

In the end, it's the interplay of light and shadow that makes our relationships beautiful, complex, and profoundly human.

instagram,"üì∑: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at Al-Ittihadiya Palace in Cairo, Egypt, Oct. 15, 2023. ‚Å†
‚Å†
üëâ Egypt's president criticized Israel‚Äôs military operation in Gaza in a stern pushback Sunday to the United States as America's top diplomat extended his frenetic travels across the Mideast trying to prevent the war with Hamas from igniting a broader regional conflict. ‚Å†
‚Å†
With an Israeli ground offensive looming, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed in some of his strongest language to date that Washington would stand with Israel ‚Äútoday, tomorrow and every day‚Äù in a partnership of shared democratic values, but that Israel must take ‚Äúevery possible precaution to avoid harming civilian.‚Äù He leveled no direct public criticism of Israel or its bombing campaign that has killed civilians in Gaza. ‚Å†
‚Å†
From Cairo, where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi conveyed his criticism, Blinken went to Jordan and planned to return to Israel on Monday, carrying to Israeli leaders the feedback he received in a rush of meetings with leaders throughout the Arab world. ‚Å†
‚Å†
His second visit to Israel in recent days will come amid heightening fears that a looming Israeli move into Gaza could spark a wider war with devastating humanitarian consequences, a growing concern for the Biden administration. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Egypt‚Äôs state-run media said el-Sisi told Blinken that Israel‚Äôs Gaza operation has exceeded ‚Äúthe right of self-defense‚Äù and turned into ‚Äúa collective punishment."" ‚Å†
‚Å†
Blinken told reporters before leaving Egypt that ‚ÄúIsrael has the right, indeed it has the obligation to defend itself against these attacks from Hamas and to try to do what it can to make sure that this never happens again."" Mindful of the potential human cost in Gaza, Blinken said ""the way that Israel does this matters. It needs to do it in a way that affirms the shared values that we have for human life and human dignity, taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.‚Äô‚Äô (AP) ‚Å†

instagram,"Propaganda has always been a part of war but the instantaneous mass communication social media provides can change public opinion from across the globe instantaneously 

Keeping other major powers out or enlisting their support is critical 

War becomes about flooding the media space as much as it is about gaining territory 

It doesn‚Äôt need to be true or even convincing, it just needs to drive emotion and jam opposing propaganda

The masses will always be susceptible to propaganda and domestic agitation, the idea the people will just have to get smarter about media consumption is incredibly dumb, that will never happen 

Censorship will be a critical tool of survival for many governments going forward 

Basically, if you allow the initial reports of events from either side of a conflict to rule you then you aren‚Äôt going to make it, but you‚Äôll also be human

Information warfare is made to target and exploit humanity in a way WMDs never could

In a statement¬†posted¬†to the Will county sheriff‚Äôs office social media page, law enforcement responded to an emergency call made by a 32-year-old woman who alleged her landlord had attacked her with a knife.

The Will county sheriff‚Äôs office said: ‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.‚Äù 
On the scene, officers found the 71-year-old suspect sitting upright on the ground near the home‚Äôs driveway and inside found two stabbing victims, a 32-year-old woman and 6-year-old boy who each suffered over a dozen stab wounds to their chest, torso and arms.

The suspect was identified as 71-year-old Joseph M Czuba and police said he was the property‚Äôs landlord.",,219,"{'like_count': 203, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 34787}",The Culture Speaks‚Ñ¢,,2023-10-15 22:47:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/69025634_742611219493200_118055461122473984_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=LwaKIGVLaK4AX8tCeZ5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBVc2fk62CRxh1bfn6Ct8QQhcVb1VUA10DUKsikDZwV1w&oe=655A9CE4,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyb88R6vq9X/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391458561_1047891622888962_7394070653413404040_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=WgOflg9Y-MwAX-kUkuI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD5Doj1mR21wvBY-guSQe6Irscrlb7JWVbxcWZuoDJCBw&oe=6559E609

instagram,"Meta is intensively moderating content across its platforms, eliminating over 795,000 content breaches of its guidelines in Hebrew and Arabic in the three days following the Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7.

In the period following the violent outbreak, the company revealed that it had deleted content at a rate sevenfold compared to the preceding two months.

The removal of content followed stringent warnings from the European Union regarding the propagation of disinformation on its platforms amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.

instagram,"Six months ago, war broke out in #Sudan. Since 15 April, the conflict has claimed over 9,500 lives, while more than 5.5 million people have fled their homes because of the fighting. 

In August, we opened a new surgical Centre in #Khartoum to provide urgent care to those who cannot receive it in other facilities. Here we receive people burned by explosions, wounded by bullets and mines, but also patients injured in accidents or by civilian trauma. Since opening the Centre, we have treated more than 500 people. 
 
We continue cardiac surgery and cardiology at the Salam Centre even though it is becoming increasingly difficult for patients to travel. In general, it is difficult to get supplies of even essential goods, fuel and medicines; every day there is a new difficulty, in addition to deteriorating security conditions. 

This war attracts few headlines, but it has already triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. 

We will remain here. We are not abandoning Sudan.

A focus of energy shared with Intention and Attention. 
As we are all powerful creators of such energy, I invite us all to offer that energy toward peace and resolution ‚Äî that no more innocent lives be lost. That hate, fear and separation be replaced by Love, Unity and Truth.

There are many people hurting, many people shouting. What Hamas has done is terrorism and deserves justice, absolutely no question; I am also scared and worried for the Palestinian civilians who are not Hamas and do not support Hamas, who find themselves caught in the crossfire. Maybe the best take I've heard so far is from activist-environmentalist-author @greengirlleah, whose words I've screenshotted below. It is possible to support the innocent on both sides, to be critical of any attack that targets the innocent, to center humanity.

My goal right now is to listen more than I talk, to amplify voices more central than my own, to donate whatever I can to aid the innocent on both sides, to be here for both my Jewish and my Palestinian friends and acquaintances for whatever they need while they weather the pain and trauma of these horrors, and to call on my government to center humanity.

instagram,"Pope Francis called on Sunday for humanitarian corridors to allow the delivery of essentials to the Gaza Strip, which is under heavy Israeli bombardment following a bloody attack by its rulers, Hamas.

Alarm has grown about a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Israel has cut off water, food and power, vowing to maintain the complete siege until all hostages taken by the Palestinian Islamist militant group are freed.

In the eight days since Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,300 Israelis in their surprise onslaught, Israel has responded with a devastating bombing campaign that has claimed over 2,300 lives in Gaza.

""Humanitarian law must be respected, especially in Gaza, where it is urgent and necessary to guarantee humanitarian corridors and help the population,"" said the Pope after his traditional Angelus prayer in Rome's Saint Peter's Square.

""I strongly urge that children, the sick, the elderly, women and all civilians should not fall victim to the conflict"", he added.

instagram,"TULSA, Okla. -- A local Rabbi and a Muslim interfaith leader spoke to FOX23 about how they are comforting their respective communities and each other amid what is happening in Israel and the Gaza Strip on Friday.

A week after Hamas attacked Israel, Rabbi Dan Kaiman, who serves as Principal Rabbi at the B'nai Emunah Synagogue got a special visit from his good friend from the Muslim faith, Aliye Shimi.

Aliye Shimi is a member of the Muslim faith and the executive director of Tulsa Metropolitan Ministry, an interfaith organization.

""I brought him some baklava from Shatila,‚Äù Shimi said. ‚ÄúSo, Shatila is actually the name of a refugee camp in Palestine.""

Shimi and Rabbi Kaiman both serve in Tulsa Metropolitan Ministry.

""We're both minorities, and it means that we know each other, and we know each other‚Äôs experiences in a different way, and I think that it actually helps create a different type of solidarity and understanding,"" Rabbi Kaiman said.

They said that's been especially important over the past week with what's been playing out in Israel and the Gaza Strip.

‚ÄúThis conflict has been going on for decades, and when we add political rhetoric to it, it fuels the fire,"" Shimi said. ‚ÄúIf we could understand that these are human beings lives, innocent human beings, who are on all sides of the situation, and if we can just humanize it for people, that would help the situation.""

They said they hope their friendship shines as an example of what could be if people took the time to understand one another, even if they have different beliefs.

""Those differences don't have to divide us,"" Rabbi Kaiman said. ‚ÄúThey don't have to be something that creates tension and struggle and strife. Those differences can actually be quite strengthening.""",,195,"{'like_count': 195, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 13354}",muslimjewishbrotherhood,,2023-10-15 21:18:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/384983331_1060310614974054_1458891557923464658_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SRPyzfV-N-wAX-a9Bik&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAizNgD51xG3CpznHruOY1zeBbxiz5dGNhPvmd8z9r7tw&oe=655B1481,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cybyy32tTX_/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391430032_711902703606190_5460513022186263802_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Z_GFHoDyLyoAX9NHkLG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCjWqQlbJlv02kMOOSKtQJEZNEsfx1LnKhktkrkCUHB6A&oe=65387297

instagram,"In the face of such heart-wrenching events, I want to share that life's purpose extends beyond our understanding. 

In this journey, we, as a collective oneness, are continuously exploring our potential.

Even through immense challenges, we must remember that it's not about the hardships we face. Instead, it's about how we respond to them collectively. 

Some family's unimaginable situation reminds us of the importance of compassion, unity, & hope in the darkest times.

Together, we can strive for a world where such suffering is no longer a reality. Nobody wants this. We want peace. No peace can come from more violence

It's essential to acknowledge the profound pain & injustice your family is enduring. No words can truly express the magnitude of such a tragedy.

history has shown that even in the most dire circumstances, the human spirit can rise above. 

As we come to terms with the harsh realities of our world, it's crucial to support one another. To stand in solidarity with those who suffer & to work tirelessly towards a future where such atrocities are no more.

While the path ahead may be hard, we must nurture the hope that is in our hearts. 

By coming together & embodying the principles of love, compassion, & justice, we can inch closer to a world where every family can live free from fear and suffering. 

This is what we are co-creating. We focus on peace to create peace. We don‚Äôt focus on more violence to create peace.

In your hope, in your manifestations, in your meditations, advocate for peace, unity, & a brighter tomorrow.

Together, we can be the driving force for change. 

Striving towards a world where no family has to endure the horrors of war & conflict.

instagram,"We're witnessing genocide on real-time. 

The ethnic killing of Palestinians has been going on for years, and if you're someone who has been supporting the cause for a while; the build up to what is happening now did not just suddenly happen overnight. 

This is the consequence of the silence and complicity of the Western world time and time again when Palestine is involved. 

The complexity of this issue isn't to do with which ""side"" is right - THE SIDE THAT IS NOT COMMITTING GENOCIDE WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT. 

The complexity comes because of the amount of US congressman with stocks in weapon industries (in which more politicians have bought stocks due to the crisis), it comes from the amount of power and wealth Zionists have in ensuring the narrative never changes from theirs, it comes from years of complicity from celebrities, politicians, CEOs, etc. 

PEOPLE AREN'T SILENT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT PALESTINE - THEY ARE SILENCED. 

Propaganda is a festering sickness, and Israeli propaganda has evolved into a full-fledged deadly pandemic. 

Even if you do not have time to read on the histories (which I urge ALL to do now), you have time to SHARE and TALK about GENOCIDE and INJUSTICE. 

Is bombing babies, children and women wrong? 

Is having people in power in government spit rhetoric on making Gaza a ""uninhabited land"", to ""kill them all"", and ""give them hell"" ok? 

Is it fine to elect members into US Congress who are heavily invested in weapon stocks and BENEFIT from geopolitical wars? 

US and the West are not only benefiting - they are reaping the fruits that they have planted. 

What the Israeli government is doing is not a reflection on real Israeli civilians that suffer as well from the conflict - and there are plenty of resources available to show how good Jewish brothers and sisters are uniting to show just HOW WRONG THE GENOCIDE OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE. 

WAKE UP. DON'T END UP HAVING TO TELL YOUR CHILDREN THAT WHILST GAZA STRIP WAS BEING BOMBED YOU DIDN'T SAY OR DO ANYTHING.

instagram,"Gold witnessed a remarkable surge on 13th October as tensions in the Middle East escalated. The situation intensified when Israel issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Gaza Palestinians to evacuate the Gaza Strip, signaling an impending major Israeli military operation. 

This ultimatum had a profound impact on geopolitical tensions, driving up gold prices significantly and resulting in its most substantial single-day rally in nearly seven months. Once gold breached the critical resistance at $1900, it triggered a substantial short squeeze, as several short positions had accumulated during the past few days when the metal was trading below the $1900 mark.

This is what someone who becomes radicalized by the dehumanization of Palestinians looks like. He murdered INNOCENT Palestinians in USA. In our own backyard.

Please pray for the family of Hanaan Shahin and Wadea Al-Fayoume.

From Will County Sheriff's office. ""Joseph Czuba was charged with First Degree Murder, Attempted First Degree Murder, Hate Crime (2 counts), and Aggravated Battery with a Deadly Weapon. Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.

The Will County Sheriff's Office would like to thank the Will County State's Attorney's Office for their assistance in working with detectives regarding Joseph Czuba being formally charged in this senseless and cowardly act of violence. Joseph Czuba was transported to the Will County Adult Detention Facility and is awaiting his initial court appearance.""

CHICAGO ‚Äì As the Israeli-Hamas conflict continues, the Illinois State Police (ISP) continues coordinating statewide law enforcement communications and activity in response to the elevated level of threats of violence and hate crimes related to the current conflict.
 
ISP reminds the public of the importance of remaining vigilant against hate crime activity and potential terrorism. 
 
‚ÄúEveryone in Illinois- both law enforcement and community members alike- must remain on guard against both terrorism and hate crimes during this period of volatility,‚Äù said ISP Director Brendan F. Kelly. ‚ÄúIf you see something, say something, before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù
 
ISP continues its outreach to Muslim and Jewish communities in Illinois to communicate with and support religious leaders being impacted by the current threat environment.
 
Intelligence sharing and communication with our local and federal partners continues around the clock with all of ISP‚Äôs assets remaining at a heightened state of readiness appropriate for this evolving and volatile situation.
 
At this time, there is no actionable intelligence regarding any credible mass threats in Illinois. However, the public should report suspicious behavior to their local law enforcement agency or call 911 depending on the level of the threat.  ISP reminds everyone that if you see something, say something.

instagram,"I condemn the violence against Palestinians happening right here and now. I woke up this morning to see a video of Palestinian students on UT Campus being verbally attacked and brutalized by total strangers for gathering in public. This horrifies me. So did the attack on Nova. Spaces for education and celebration should be spaces without violence.

To my Palestinian friends, I love you deeply. To my Jewish friends, I also love you deeply. I have zero lived experience in your bodies, and I can only imagine how the last week felt. I know many people in my community are scared for valid reasons‚Äîthat the decontextualized dialogue surfacing may lead to more direct and decontextualized violence, victimhood, death and isolation. I see grief for the ancestors, I see grief for those whose lives and livelihoods are lost and taken. I want to validate and hold space for that spectrum of pain without telling anyone how to feel. 

I write this out of hope. Hope for a free Palestine in my lifetime. Hope for an end to the genocide, war and ethnic, cultural erasure that frame this conflict and similar conflicts around the world. Hope for a world that welcomes meaningful nuance in an effort to clarify, not to obscure or make comfortable. Due to the violent nature of what is currently unfolding, I have no idea what those hopes may require, either. I just know that to be alive is to be bewildered by what has come before us and what will come after and that for the short time we are here, we must grapple with the decisions of our ancestors, the power dynamics of our time and work honestly to honor those who are alive alongside us. That is also easier said than done.

For those of us who do not have ancestral or lived experience with this conflict, I hope we will do our part to actively listen and refrain from co-opting pain that does not belong to us. I also hope that we are unafraid to express solidarity for the human rights we expect in our daily lives and that we openly condemn the violence our tax dollars support at home and overseas.

instagram,"The US dollar touched a one-week high against a basket of currencies on Friday, extending its gains from the previous session when hot US consumer prices data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4 percent in September, keeping the annual rate at 3.7 percent, the same as in August, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast it would gain 0.3 percent on the month and 3.6 percent year-on-year.

Data on Wednesday had shown US producer prices increased more than expected in September amid higher costs for energy products and food.

""Traders didn't really believe in the hot PPI for September until CPI yesterday reinforced it,"" Helen Given, FX Trader at Monex USA, said.

""I see yesterday's big USD move as a correction to the under-reaction to PPI Wednesday,"" Given said.

The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six of its major peers, ticked up 0.11 percent to 106.63. The index, which jumped 0.8 percent on Thursday, its biggest one-day rise since March 15, is on pace to finish the week up 0.5 percent.

The dollar was also helped by safe-haven buying driven by the escalating Middle East conflict as Israel urged civilians to leave the northern Gaza Strip.

""Our sense is that the greenback's renewed strength in large part also reflects growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the wake of the new war between Hamas and Israel,"" Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

Commentary from Fed speakers is likely to keep the dollar supported.

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said Friday he believes the central bank is likely done with rate hikes amid an ongoing waning in price pressures, while flagging the uncertainty of how long rates will need to remain elevated.

instagram,"Ever since learning about the Israeli air strike that killed Issam Abdullah‚Äîand wounded several other journalists in Southern Lebanon, I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about our community of journalists, why we do what we do, and the way that the enormous propaganda and misinformation that has come out of this war and shaped the discourse around it is a sickening insult to everyone who has ever put their life in danger to bring people the truth. 

I cannot believe that 12 journalists have been killed in the past week alone, that people who were alive a few days ago are no longer with us, that we can still even view their Instagram stories sometimes. Dozens of others have been wounded or had to evacuate their homes as Israel bombards, and prepares to further bombard Gaza. Not to mention covering the horrors inflicted on their own communities.

I'm not Muslim or Jewish or Palestinian or Israeli. I'm not a historian or an expert on Middle East relations. I don't have all the answers or a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and nuances between warring factions and I can't tell anyone how to create peace in the world, much less in areas that have such a long history of pain and violence. But, like all Palestinians and Israelis, I'm *human* and I can guarantee that continuing to kill and maim and hate fellow human beings is NOT the answer, especially when it's innocent civilians and vulnerable groups, such as children, who feel the brunt of their leaders' actions. There has got to be a better way than this. üòî

To all of those on both sides who have lost loved ones, who have been harmed, who have been displaced, who are living in terror of what's happened and what's to come, you do NOT deserve this and I'm so, so sorry. üíî

And to the rest of us, please show some humanity and compassion for the PEOPLE who are suffering, regardless of where they live or who they live under. Creating further division is only driving the wedge in further‚Ä¶it‚Äôs time for unity against hate, against violence, against continued bloodshed. It‚Äôs long past time to break the cycle of cruelty and conflict and work towards peace and harmony.

üëâ The Red Cross said Saturday it was ""appalled"" by the human misery unleashed by the war between Hamas and Israel, saying its volunteers would not abandon those who needed them most. ‚Å†
‚Å†
It called on both sides to abide by international humanitarian law, protect civilians and allow humanitarian organizations to alleviate the growing levels of suffering. ‚Å†
‚Å†
""The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is appalled to see the human misery that has unfolded over the last week in Israel and Gaza,"" with civilians paying the highest price, a statement said. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Thousands of Palestinians sought refuge Saturday after Israel warned them to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip ahead of an expected ground offensive against Hamas, one week after the deadliest attack in Israel's history. ‚Å†
‚Å†
""Nothing can justify the horrific loss of civilian lives in Israel last weekend... but such tragedy cannot in turn justify the limitless destruction of Gaza,"" the Red Cross statement said. ""We are deeply alarmed by the call for relocation in Gaza. Our volunteers refuse to leave and abandon those who need them most. They must be protected -- so that they can protect others."" ‚Å†

Israel had given the entire population of the north of the Gaza Strip a Saturday morning deadline to move south ahead of an expected ground offensive to root out Hamas militants. It has said it will keep two roads open until 4 p.m. to allow people to escape. ‚Å†

Safadi said the military campaign against Hamas was killing innocent civilians and would bring despair and destruction in its wake that would not bring security to Israel. ‚Å†

instagram,"Heartbreaking tragedy unfolds as a 6-year-old boy was fatally stabbed and his mother severely wounded in an anti-Muslim hate crime near Chicago. The victims were targeted due to their religion amid ongoing Middle Eastern conflict. Joseph M. Czuba, the landlord, has been charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, hate crimes, and aggravated battery for this senseless act. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (@cair_national) decried the incident as a ""worst nightmare,"" calling for a swift investigation.

This horrifying incident spotlights the surge in Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiments. Amid the backdrop of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the lack of balanced media coverage and political leaders' failure to promote peace and de-escalation has fueled an atmosphere where such attacks become more likely. It is a stark reminder of the need for solidarity and justice to combat hate crimes, discrimination, and violence against marginalized communities. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families.

instagram,"Exploring Nietzsche's Astrological üåì Chart on his 179th birthday. üç∞ Birthday 15 October 1844 at approx 10:00 AM

üåû Sun in Libra
üåô Moon in Sagittarius
üîº Ascendant Scorpio

Nietzsche's birth chart reveals a dance between his Libran ideals and Sagittarius's fiery, expansive nature. His relentless quest for balance and harmony met the call of adventure, guiding him on a unique path of self-discovery.

üß† Mercury - Mars 
Uranus-Jupiter: The Power of Intellect üåü

Nietzsche was a force to be reckoned with when it came to intellect. His Mercury-Mars conjunction in Virgo ignited his critical and scientific mind. Uranus and Jupiter added a touch of rebellion, pushing him to challenge conventional wisdom and redefine values.

üåä Neptune's Influence: Mystical Musings

Neptune's presence in Nietzsche's third house made him blend philosophy and art mesmerizingly. His thoughts were often elusive, flowing like poetic aphorisms, and his ideas transcended the boundaries of traditional philosophy.

üó°Ô∏è Sun-Pluto Opposition: Battle Within üåó

A profound struggle was brewing within Nietzsche, as seen in the Sun-Pluto opposition. It symbolized his intense battle for power and self-realization, often leading to an inflated ego and a desire to transcend mediocrity.

ü™ê Saturn's T-Square: Isolation and Control 

Saturn's T-Square formation portrayed Nietzsche's inner conflict with isolation and control. He needed to define himself against the collective, embodying the image of an outsider and iconoclast.

üíî Venus-Moon Square: A Complex Relationship with the Feminine üåπ

Nietzsche's emotional sensitivity and vulnerability were reflected in the Venus-Moon square. His denial of the feminine and obsession with masculine forms of power might have responded to his perceived weakness, contributing to his complicated relationship with the concept of love and connection.

instagram,"My purpose is to inspire people through the inspiration of space exploration and to Aim Higher for a better future. The thing I love about space is not only what we build, but that when we leave Earth it‚Äôs so clear that we‚Äôre all just humans on the same planet who need to take care of each other. 

#OTD October 15, 2015, I was in Israel with Buzz Aldrin for IAC, an Int‚Äôl space conference that takes place in a different country every year. Being in Israel for the first time was scary. People were randomly being stabbed on the street in Jerusalem where we were. Buzz and I heard gunshots outside of the hotel during one of his interviews. We were nervous and scared to go out in public so I didn‚Äôt get to see much of Jerusalem. 

Then the curator of the Tower of David invited us for a private tour. She said she‚Äôd send cars to pick us up and ensured our safety. When we got in the taxi our driver heard our American accents and said, ‚ÄúWhen you go back to America can you please tell people that we‚Äôre not all bad. I‚Äôm Palestinian and my friends are Christians, Muslims and Jews. There are a small group of people making life miserable for the rest of us who get along. Please tell them we‚Äôre not all the same.‚Äù

When we got to the Tower of David the curator took us to a big hall and said, ‚ÄúLast week we had a beautiful musical celebration of many religions and cultures - Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist and more. I‚Äôm Jewish and grew up in Israel but my friends are from many backgrounds. When you go back to America, can you please tell them we just want to live in harmony.‚Äù

Two different people who didn‚Äôt even know each other pleaded with us to understand that the vast majority just want peace and to have what everyone wants, to be with their families and loved ones and have a good life. 

I pray this conflict ends soon and those who are crushed by anger and grief can move past that into acceptance and compassion for the other side. 

Praying for peace for all. üôè

instagram,"I have purposely kept quiet for a long time on social media. Big big big health issues, life changes, time spent working, juggling depression, sickness, family, and all the things. And I have purposely kept quiet about the Israel/Palestinian conflict because y‚Äôall, know how I feel about this. I don‚Äôt see how keeping all the people in Gaza is any different than Hitler putting the Jewish people in ghettos and then condemning them to death not being the same as Israel bombing the fuck out of Gaza after they kept all of them there just like they‚Äôve always wanted to do. I said what I said.

At this point, winners or losers, my biggest concern is my baby, who has orders to deploy for nearly all of 2024 to parts unknown seeing things in the world no human should ever have to bear witness to. As mothers, we spend our whole lives living for our children, surviving to protect our children, and praying every day that when we wake up, that nothing bad will come to our children because absolutely nothing is more important in our world than our children whether they are one day old or 100 years old. I‚Äôd never want to live a day without knowing I did everything I could to keep my child happy, safe, loved and protected and this is the one time that I can‚Äôt and it hurts all over. So if I‚Äôm quiet it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm praying that between the crisis in two parts of the world that nothing happens to my whole world half a world away.

The Arab-Israeli conflict since the Cold War ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

__
The Israeli Air Force bombardments on Gaza City have killed over 1,900 people and destroyed entire blocks of buildings causing large amounts of rubble - the bombings are what pre-seeds an Israeli Defense Force invasion with tanks and artillery support. 

__
Due to the simultaneous by the militants on October 7th, 2023, in Israel's southern district, they killed 1,400 Israelis (mostly civilians), and the death toll for IDF personnel is over 200.

__
The militants took as hostages over 100 people, including elderly and young Israelis. Since the outbreak of war, the Israeli Defense Forces have mobilized over 300,000 military personnel and hundreds of armoured vehicles. 

__
[That has become] the largest Israeli mobilization since the Yom Kipper War of October 1973 against the Egyptian and Syrian militaries in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights. It‚Äôs another conflict, in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict since May 1948 in the Levant and Middle East. 

__
The 'nature' of the Arab/Palestinian-Israeli conflict did shift over the years of the Cold War from large-scale, regional Arab-Israeli conflict ‚Äî to a more local Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which climax in the IDF's full-scale invasion of Lebanon on June 6th to September 1982.

Sumit Singh
Pune, 15th October 2023: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has prompted the Pune Police to ramp up security measures around the Jewish community in the city. The decision aims to prevent potential violent incidents that might arise in the wake of global tensions.

The Jewish community in Pune primarily resides in the Camp, Koregaon Park, Wanwadi, and Koregaon Park areas. Among the notable places of worship is Ohel David Synagogue, situated in the Camp area. Pune Police Commissioner Retesh Kumaarr has issued an immediate directive to elevate security protocols in these regions.

A comprehensive security review was conducted, led by Commissioner Ritesh Kumar, Joint Commissioner Sandeep Karnik, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ramnath Pokle, and DCP (Crime) Amol Zende. The team assessed the current security arrangements and decided to augment infrastructure to further fortify these areas.

Deputy Commissioners of Police from various departments have scrutinized the security measures in place and have directed local police station officials to maintain a heightened state of alert. A meeting with members of the Jewish community was also held to discuss the protection of their places of worship and other community spaces.",,105,"{'like_count': 104, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 21745}",Punekar News,,2023-10-15 17:46:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/363901713_596593179070383_5346951766254473326_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=BllLiEaXr9gAX-PtdXF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBobnzvYMvxj3wFLsAdYhNQaQn-WBkBv1hMq6p5zIvs2Q&oe=655AC516,https://www.instagram.com/p/CybajDoNWJX/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391718800_701175452042098_269582776723605251_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ZIM3nbboDSUAX91B7iF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDeDMLLn0AU0KKZ5F1tSPodyACriCjuIVS8Sizv335kdg&oe=65329428

instagram,"The last several years of playing around with different formats and venues for my photo work largely boils down to a conflict between optimizing for a sizable audience vs. optimizing for a knowledgeable audience, and trying to bridge the gap by nudging people into the latter category via writing.

I want my audience to engage with the tough questions and the messy details of built environment stewardship and related policy. Part of why I started writing about my photos several years ago is because I got sick of reactions like ""so rad..."" on images of, like, schools that were closed during the Rahm admin and left derelict. Fetishizing visuals without knowledge, or often even respect, for the conditions being portrayed.

At the same time, I don't want my work to exist in a space entirely dominated by enthusiasts or practitioners of the same, who are already read up. I feel a responsibility as a documentarian to bring my audience along for why I choose to capture the scenes I capture, and what significance I feel they hold. And to some degree, that's been successful.

But platforms are often a limiter. Instagram isn't set up as a useful conversational space. Flickr is just photographers talking to photographers. A personal blog isn't discoverable by many of the people who could get the most out of learning about some of the context behind the work.

So I've tried lots of things. I think I'm developing a better muscle for methods of sharing the photos and their stories that construe what I want while still being accessible. But it's a work in progress - what isn't? I can't help but be dismayed when somebody who has followed my work for awhile drops an Instagram comment like ""new construction is ruining our city!"", but I also know that I ultimately can't control that. Some people just won't engage in the details.

About a month ago, somebody asked me about my work in the context of their interest in built environment anthropology. And I think what I told them at the time, shown in these screenshots, accurately reflects the undergirding philosophy for my photography today. It's just a matter of translating that into visible, readable form.",,103,"{'like_count': 95, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 2047}",Soren Spicknall,,2023-10-15 02:46:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/295142334_622694659003931_3158424857031537113_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=YXyKWA2CE-QAX_iR1Po&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCAiOxZE6iAAvuzhZ0xyRXQJQUq8fLJTTvmWTP_jwe7Ug&oe=655ACF1A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZzicCuo7G/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/357994533_3580120965578425_6011742809297238125_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=8YnkctlGrJkAX9HsCnz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDRr6ez30S0NR4ph1W1lexEYTb-lxBtn79xFY_tXd1ECg&oe=6559C121

instagram,"Farhat Mantoo, Executive Director of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF), South Asia, talks about the dire humanitarian and healthcare crisis in #Gaza with Himanshu Shekhar Mishra from NDTV.

The situation in Gaza right now is catastrophic and heartbreaking. M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) has over 300 doctors and healthcare workers on the ground, and many of them have lost their homes and families. Our teams are working at three hospitals and a clinic, and we're also providing medicines and medical equipment.

There is a massive influx of patients, many with burns and traumatic injuries that need ongoing care after surgery. 

The hospitals are struggling because there's no electricity, water, or fuel. In fact, three weeks' worth of supplies were used up in just three days.

We urgently need to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza and ensure that healthcare workers can move safely. We urge all parties in the conflict to allow humanitarian organizations to bring in supplies and help those in need.

instagram,"For our children.

The scale of last weekend's surprise attacks by Hamas militants on Israel has staggered Israel and the world.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hundreds of Israelis have been killed, thousands injured and dozens still held hostage by Hamas, young children included. Israel's ongoing retaliation has left hundreds of Palestinians dead, at least 90 children among them, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. And humanitarian groups are warning of a coming crisis if Israel follows through on its vow to cut off food, water and electricity to Gaza, where nearly half of residents are under 18 years of age.‚Å†
‚Å†
The news is alarming for anyone ‚Äî and especially for children, who may be left grappling with questions about why other children are among those affected, and whether they are safe. Here's some advice on how to get started with talking to kids about the conflict.‚Å†

instagram,"More than one million people have been displaced in the Gaza Strip in the last week, the UN said Sunday, after sustained Israeli bombardment and warnings about a ground attack.

Israel has massed thousands of troops and heavy weaponry in the desert south of the country, waiting for the green light to go in to northern Gaza.

The army has told 1.1 million Palestinians in the north of the Gaza Strip -- nearly half of its 2.4-million population -- to head south to safety.

The UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees said on Sunday that some one million people had already been displaced in the first week of the conflict.

""The number is likely to be higher as people continue to leave their homes,"" UNRWA director of communications Juliette Touma told AFP.

We have all failed when we don‚Äôt give people the tools to resolve conflict without violence or harm.

We fail when entire people groups are raised under aggression, fear, oppression, and lack. 

We fail when we teach boys they are owed the attention or bodies or control of girls.

Thanks to all who joined our solar eclipse channeling event yesterday. The Guides shared so many heartfelt + empowering messages, along with many activations. They addressed the below and so much more:

- Spiritual endurance
- War consciousness
- The conflict in Israel + Palestine
- The importance of developing our channel + trusting our gnosis
-  We can then bring in more akashic knowledge about the golden epochs of peace that have existed on our planet: Lemuria, Atlantis, Ancient Egypt, Avalon 
- Releasing guilt as a lightworker for holding zero point neutrality 
- Activating our planetary magnetism + gravitational pull 

By the end of it, we had no words to articulate all that we received.ü•≤ For those who want to catch the replay, it will be available tomorrow via my site + bio link.

instagram,"Connection and Conclusion of Trilogy; ‚Üì 

I wrapped a chat with AI about the artworks and ngl might have failed to explain this well; 

 ""Dance with Me on Top of the World"" initiates our journey with a scene of celebration, setting the tone for a vibrant narrative. In ""Act IV, Scene II; Revenge of RED,"" the story takes a darker turn, introducing conflict and perhaps a quest for revenge. This evolving narrative is visually connected through consistent colour palette, motifs, and evolving characters.

As we progress to ""The Protagonist,"" we witness a pivotal moment in the trilogy. The character we followed through triumphs and challenges faces a brutal backstabbing, not by an external force but by herself. This self-betrayal becomes a powerful metaphor, exploring the internal struggles and complexities within the protagonist.

The title of the final artwork, beginning with the letter ""T,"" introduces an element of intrigue. What is the word that encapsulates the conclusion of this trilogy? How does this final piece provide closure, answer lingering questions, or leave room for interpretation?

With ""The Protagonist"" as the central figure, facing the consequences of internal conflict, the trilogy reaches its climax. The visual evolution, thematic continuity, and narrative threads create a cohesive and engaging experience for the viewer. The finale prompts us to reflect on the intricate dance between celebration and strife, revenge and redemption, and the profound struggles within the protagonist's journey.

As viewers explore these three artworks, they are invited to interpret, question, and immerse themselves in a world that unfolds through brushstrokes and symbolism. The journey from celebration to self-betrayal to the enigmatic finale encapsulates the complexity of the human experience, leaving an indelible mark on those who engage with this narrative.

instagram,"The echoes of protests for Gaza ripple across the globe, but do they hold the power to effect change? Amidst the devastation inflicted upon Gaza, the potency of public outcry remains a beacon of hope.

Here's how taking to the streets can indeed tilt the scales:

1. Awakening the Global Conscience: Protests jolt the world awake, casting a stark light on Gaza's realities often veiled by political fog and media misinformation. They're not just rallies but a kind of education, explaining and unraveling nuanced narratives that reach public forums and enter private conversations alike.
 
2. Unity in Defiance: More than expressions of dissent, protests are threads weaving a tapestry of solidarity. They're a united call resonating across oceans, assuring Palestinians they're not just a cause but a shared heartbeat, their voices amplified in unison with thousands of others.

3. Diplomacy Under Duress: Collective dissent transcends slogans, reaching the halls of power. It's a global chorus demanding action, capable of nudging powers that be, shaking the status quo, and potentially charting paths towards a change seldom considered before.

4. Beyond Numbers: Faces of Conflict: Protests paint the human face behind grim statistics. They're storytellers, narrating tales of lives, dreams, and sorrows, reminding the world that the conflict bleeds beyond territorial lines, into homes and hearts in Gaza.

5. Justice's Domino Effect: Gaza-focused protests don't stand alone; they're catalysts. They can ignite wider movements, fanning flames of global advocacy for human rights, emboldening international law, and knitting diverse causes into a shared mantle of justice.

In essence, protests are far from futile. They're catalysts, consciousness-raisers, and connectors ‚Äî a triad that, when combined with sustained political and humanitarian efforts, holds the promise of steering the narrative towards a horizon of hope, justice, and lasting peace.

 Foto 1: Hamas, de beweging die de Gazastrook leidt en door de EU en VS wordt beschouwd als terroristische organisatie, lanceerde zaterdagochtend een verrassingsaanval op Isra√´l. Als tegenreactie valt Isra√´l sindsdien ook doelwitten in de Gazastrook aan. Een Palestijnse man tilt op deze foto een meisje uit een door Isra√´l gebombardeerd huis in Khan Younis, in het zuiden van de Gazastrook. üì∏ Ibraheem Abu Mustafa / Reuters‚Å†
‚Å†
Foto 2: Bij de aanval van zaterdag zou Hamas zeker 150 gijzelaars hebben meegenomen bij wijze van wisselgeld. Hamas dreigt sindsdien met het doden van gijzelaars als Isra√´l doorgaat met bombardementen op Gaza. Hier transporteren Palestijnen naar verluidt een van de Isra√´lische gijzelaars rond de zuidelijke stad Khan Younis. üì∏ AFP‚Å†

instagram,"~ a Jungian perspective on the conflict in the Middle East ~

If you knew this was a dream, if you knew this was nothing other than a curiously strange and transient play of consciousness, how would your perspective change? 

For me, it would become painfully clear that none of these conflicts are separate from me...

None of these conflicts are new either. Humanity has always held these shadows and none of us are immune to the embodiment of what we are witnessing.

Technology and social media act as magnifying glass, amplifying the collective consciousness in our individual psyches. 

And it‚Äôs a lot to take in.

But the parts of us that are pushed into the unconscious don‚Äôt disappear. They actually gain gravity. Obscuring the light of the conscious realm, just waiting to be seen and accepted as part of the whole. 

Becoming conscious in this day and age can be super painful - it requires a more developed nervous system than previous generations in order to process such massive amounts of information and collective emotional trauma.

I stay with the possibility that poison always appears with the antidote close by. If we can acknowledge the poison, and focus our attention on the solution, perhaps it will appear.

There is no way of proving that this is not a dream. If we were lucid, what would the solution be?",,67,"{'like_count': 60, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 3516}",Chantaia ~ Chanti Soleil Holroyd,,2023-10-15 00:27:50,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/395326338_990663562230361_3924424263442363321_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=wic05pX26vkAX-QazLZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCqZYFbx4aGYsjVx-YJZpalt-8Xaaug6-nwf2XTaAdO9g&oe=655B9505,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZjqkpv8vR/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391613505_18388416790039466_4593722539204703263_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fQEdRYYSoqEAX_W2wjB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAx-fLzCYbwAvGOMR0oovstDhcgB9s1mfUVeSgCBBRIng&oe=6558A440

instagram,"#trauma survivors often experience one (or multiple) of four distinct responses ‚Äì Fight, Flight, Freeze, and Fawn. 

Each of these responses holds a unique role in coping and surviving #traumatic experiences. 

‚Üò Fight: When faced with trauma, some respond by confronting the situation head-on. 

‚Üò Flight: The instinct to flee from a threatening situation is a survival mechanism, pushing individuals to seek safety and escape harm.

‚Üò Freeze: Often seen as a physiological response, freezing occurs when the body and mind become immobilized during a traumatic event. It's a form of protective paralysis, allowing individuals to #disassociate temporarily and minimize the impact of overwhelming emotions. 

‚Üò Fawn: #fawning is about seeking appeasement and making connections to ensure safety. Survivors may adopt a #submissive or people-pleasing attitude, attempting to gain approval and avoid harm. 

Understanding these trauma responses sheds light on the #adaptive mechanisms survivors use to navigate their trauma. 

It's crucial to approach each response with empathy, recognizing that individuals employ these strategies to survive and ultimately heal.

instagram,"Why Barry Manilow? Well, he made the whole world sing. He wrote the songs. He's Jewish of course. You only have to look at him. Like me. Yes you see a Jewish woman. If I died tomorrow everyone would say at the very least one thing probably first or second in the list: ""she was Jewish. Because that's what you see and that's a fact. But today it needs qualifying. Contextualising. Sorry but it does. I would say ""well, Ish"" because right now I feel I'm a bad Jew, the wrong kind of Jew. Many prominent Jewish people do not hide their contempt or veiled criticism of those of us who won't focus solely on the barbarity of Hamas' attack last weekend but who saw immediately it was associated with history and recent Israeli history at that. Try as I might, I cannot and do not stand only with the innocent victims of the terrorist atrocity of 7 October. I cannot turn a blind eye to Gaza. I never could to be honest. I have understood the conflict for a long time has meant being careful to be loyal and truthful to my heritage without being immoral or hypocritical to my belief which is this: I stand with humans who want to try and break a vengeful cycle of hate and death. It means that today I stand up and say I'm Jewish and let me tell you, I cannot go into my ordinary deli without wanting to burst into tears and I cannot sleep well and I feel more Jewish than I ever have in my life. But I do not stand with the vengeful sarcasm of some and they are all over X who sneer angrily and worse at their ""enemy"" and who list a hierarchy of hate and suffering. Please no: let us be civil and respectful. Let us not return the murder of one child, one son, one daughter, with the murder of another. That isn't who we are. What to do? I'm going to play Barry Manilow is what I'm going to do. Because he made the whole world sing. He is Jewish but he isn't singing a Jewish song. Just a pop song. No-one can shoot a pop song.

instagram,"This week my thoughts have been almost entirely on what is happening in Israel and Gaza and the horror of it all. Honestly most days my head and heart and soul aches from it all. I have mainly kept off social media because to share here can feel like shouting into a void but today I found myself wanting to come here and share so here are my thoughts from my heart‚Ä¶

I grew up in an Islamic community where we always greet each other by saying ‚ÄúAsalam Alaykum‚Äù and in an embrace offer back ‚ÄúWa Alaykum Asalam‚Äù

This means ‚ÄúPeace be upon you‚Äù and you offer back ‚Äúand Peace be upon you.‚Äù

To me this is the heart of our humanity; Our ability to offer peace. 

I have talked with many of my friends this week and in the hurt, the anger, the confusion, and the complexities of emotion I have heard one thing over and over: all we want is peace. 

This war is horrifying on so many levels. Hamas is not the Palestinian people and the Israeli Government is not the Jewish people. This conflict is complex but terror is terror and when I see each day more and more atrocities being enacted on innocent people, my mind races wondering what I can do. 

And the answer that came to me is simple: I open my heart to you. 

I see the pain and fear of my Israeli and Jewish friends and offer you my arms in embrace. 

I see the pain and fear of my Palestinian and Muslim friends and offer you my arms in embrace. 

I see the pain and fear in the world and offer you my arms in embrace.

And in my embrace I offer,
Peace be upon you. 
Peace be upon us all. 

My heart is open.",,58,"{'like_count': 55, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 71019}",Jahje Ives,,2023-10-15 21:55:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/375238919_976100970321466_1037043994745266817_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=GG0vN8pJ0qIAX-9UUik&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA_t6SLlOF_hG4IjnZImQBg7b1kRtGtABjTYEjg97gH0A&oe=655B5128,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyb3Eubppf2/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392781143_288935257273550_8129448794081750255_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=8PDQtmGi5nsAX9TfoN8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBX3XBBMOc6iOnS3DxX_YNX6rhH8NIC4XtIR6QohgKOrg&oe=65594E9E
instagram,"I have mixed feeling about how Israel wants the world to be involved  in this conflict.. during decades they were happy the international community was staying mostly silent about their politic that had nothing to do with religion and was the perfect breeding ground for islamists group to develop. I am really annoyed to see the self proclaimed inconditional support from US and Europe to Israel even tho I understand that it is an ideologic war and its purely geostrategic. Muslim people need to see that their life matter too. Whats happening in Gaza is disgusting and as a humanist in my artistic expression the least I can do now is just to show some empathy to these forgotten kids used like human shield by Hamas. I hope that this tag will make some people feel included, loved and heared.  I am really sad for all the families suffering from this terrorist act perpetrated by Hamas on october 7th and I hope Israel and the world will get rid of islamists groups. I send my deepest love to all the jewish community who is suffering and the wide muslim community beeing stigmatised that I encourage to raise voices against barbarism. Now with all this beeing said. I stand with Israel.

Do you think a country that has a multi-million , if not billion $ #IronDome defense system was caught unawares and overwhelmed ??? 

If not then it's UNTHINKABLE they would ALLOW themselves to be attacked in order to justify war

The U.S.military has : 

Rules of engagement & Proportionality 

Both seem to be completely ignored right now üò™

üáÆüá± has conscription , so pretty much everyone who is able to serve in military has served , Palestine has a population which is very young ,  some sources say 65% of population is under the age of 24 ! 

I can't imagine what that is like that the youth don't even envision themselves living to a ripe old age , or have elders to seek advice from because all they've know is conflict for their entire lives ?!

instagram,"Too many Christian churches promote white Christian nationalism over and against the teachings of Jesus. In a time of war and conflict, the pastors in these churches fail to see the image of God in either neighbors or strangers. 

‚ÄúThe whole concept of the imago Dei, as it is expressed in Latin, the ‚Äòimage of God,‚Äô is the idea that all men have something within them that God injected.¬† Not that they have substantial unity with God, but that every man has a capacity to have fellowship with God.¬† And this gives him a uniqueness, it gives him worth, it gives him dignity.¬† And we must never forget this as a nation: there are not gradations in the image of God‚Ä¶¬† We will know one day that God made us to live together as brothers and to respect the dignity and worth of every man.‚Äù - The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Jews are created in the image of God. Palestinians are created in the image of God. Both are of sacred worth, and both have a right to live free from fear, terror, and oppression. If we cannot see that, we are blind.

Peace be with you.

instagram,"Saudi Arabia has strongly condemned the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and attacks on civilians in the region, marking the kingdom's most forceful criticism of Israel since the recent conflict began. Thousands of Palestinians fled to southern Gaza as Israel called for evacuations from the north amid the ongoing strikes. The Saudi foreign ministry's statement was issued as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Riyadh as part of a regional tour. Saudi Arabia has been vocal in its support for the Palestinian cause during the conflict, and the war has complicated U.S. efforts to foster relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Strange how our ability to control our mind and situation changes over time and the main reason is people and environment around us. We allow external elements like people and internal elements like expectations and sentiments to make us weak.

I was extremely strong in making deductions and coming to conclusion long while back but then the content and people that you allow in your life awakens a certain part of your brain that tricks you to believe that you‚Äôll feel something new. And that was fall. It was all a trick. 

Although this weak side of mine rewarded me with new experiences which allowed me to feel a completely weak inner self that brought me to a rock bottom. But coming to a rock bottom was an amazing experience of not having to lose anything yet I was so powerful.

I allowed my emotions to control my logics rather than I used to use my logical deductions to control my emotions. As I come back to reality today after 6 years I realise the later is very much less painful (but the first one has beauty of it if you know how to enjoy pain)

There is a war going on, not outside that is merely a geopolitical conflict but inside of you thst is killing you every second. A war of thoughts and opinions and content of people who you have never met and haven‚Äôt lived your life. You are subconsciously using that information to solve your problems which is completely unrelated.

I declare selfawareness as current state of mind. Logical stability and ability to make deductions while staying in the present moment to make decision for greater good which is emotional experiences. ü•Ç

instagram,"Water: one of the reasons for conflict in the Mediterranean. Those who control the water, control negotiations

In May I had the opportunity to visit Jordan with @oneofmany.studio as part of a residency. One of the intentions was to explore my ancestry, which has parts Iraqi Jew and Chinese. This exploration was through calligraphy. Where I took my childhood practice of Chinese Calligraphy and applied it to text in Hebrew and Arabic with the help of @nourbatyne and @hanagammoh 

By the end of the trip, I felt inspired to not just write text in these languages but to start to combine them into new words. I ended up creating 3 words in Mandarin and Arabic - light, water and the way. This second one is the word water.

For many of us, our ancestry is tied up in many different cultures, languages and borders. My family have fled their homelands over the decades and I continue this tradition of finding home in new lands. It is not ok for political leaders to sacrifice thousands of people in this way. To try to force the world to take sides.

instagram,"I may be a writer, a journalist, an author, but Mercury ‚Äî¬†the planet of communication ‚Äî¬†is as invested in listening as it is speaking. So, perhaps it is as a Mercury-ruled person, that, in times of crisis, I look to respected voices for guidance, reassurance, and wisdom. In the wake of the horrifying events in Israel and Palestine, I‚Äôve been looking and listening to Rabbi Sharon Brous, a leading, ‚Äúsoulful, justice-driven‚Äù voice in the Jewish American community.

In the midst of grieving and contending with fear and disappointment, anger, overwhelm, helplessness and paralyzing sadness as a Jewish American, Rabbi Brous‚Äô words have felt like something to hold onto. I‚Äôm sharing them today, because, with hope, they‚Äôll resonate with you, too.

As an astrologer, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the message of the¬†the solar eclipse and new moon at 21 degrees Libra, which was exact yesterday. Libra, ruled by Venus, the planet of relationships, values diplomacy while its opposite sign, Aries, ruled by Mars, the God of War, centers aggression and conflict. It‚Äôs no wonder that, as we grapple with complex, intense emotions and how to best present them to others, many of us feel torn between these two extremes. But eclipses are all about accepting massive shifts, and we all have the choice right now to share our thoughts and feelings in a way that‚Äôs neither candy-coated or combative. Another voice I respect is that of one of my astrology teachers, @rebeccagordonastrology, who writes that the eclipse is asking us ‚Äúto change the codes of how we relate to one another. In order to do that, we must CHOOSE healing versus perpetuating cycles of pain, fear, or animosity. It asks us to do this on the global stage as well as in our personal lives. There is another way and we can change the patterns.‚Äù

I find it heartening that these two women whose voices I deeply respect ‚Äî¬†one a leader in the Jewish community, the other a leader in the astrological community ‚Äî are saying the same thing: that changing the way we relate to one another will, ultimately, lead to healing.

WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) ‚Äì Top U.S. officials warned on Sunday that the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas could escalate into a bigger conflict across the Middle East, saying they were worried the Lebanese group Hezbollah could attack Israel‚Äôs north or that Iran might get involved.

Another set of U.S. warships was headed to the region in a show of force meant to prevent such escalation.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced deployment of a second carrier group late on Saturday, calling it a sign of ‚Äúour resolve to deter any state or non-state actor seeking to escalate this war.‚Äù The aircraft carrier the USS Dwight Eisenhower will join a small fleet including the massive USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier in the eastern Mediterranean.

Israel has unleashed a ferocious bombing campaign over Gaza in retaliation for unprecedented attacks inside Israel by Hamas eight days ago that killed some 1,300 Israelis, mostly civilians. Gaza authorities say more than 2,200 people have been killed there, a quarter of them children. Casualties are expected to rise as Israel prepares for an expected ground assault on the tiny, densely populated enclave.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS that ‚Äúthere is a risk of an escalation of this conflict, the opening of a second front in the north and, of course, Iran‚Äòs involvement.‚Äù

The comments were echoed by White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, who told Fox News that the White House was worried about ‚Äúa potential escalation or a widening of this conflict.‚Äù

Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned his country could act, telling al Jazeera that it had conveyed a message to Israeli officials that ‚Äúif they do not cease their atrocities in Gaza, Iran cannot simply remain an observer.‚Äù

instagram,"""OPENING TO THE BODY: Sounds strange. Doesn't it? Yet, most of us have peculiar relationships with our bodies. We are either obsessed with it or have dissociated from it because we live so much in our heads. 

In several spiritual traditions, the body is considered a hindrance to higher knowledge. Some teachings go so far as to say that it is a bag of filth and must be ignored in favor of mind- and intellect-based investigations. This view only creates a deeper conflict between the unity of life we strive to see and our warped, dysfunctional relationships with our bodies. 
What if we came to see the body as it is? 

At its core, the body is a mass of exquisite and dynamic sensations - each a facet of awareness, sweetly arising and subsiding into nothingness. 
Our sense organs are portals to this ever-changing landscape of unimaginable sensuality. And if we are willing to allow the body to teach us, it will lead the way into the pulsating sweetness that permeates creation. 

If we could only see beyond its shape and size or its limitations of flexibility, strength, and fitness, the body could change our relationship with health, disease, ourselves, others, and everything. 

Our very limitations can become doorways to freedom. And this is the secret of Tantra. In this tradition, nothing is filthy or limited. Everything is divine. Everything is in plain sight. We just need to open our eyes.""

instagram,"Under the leadership of Khaled El-Balshi, the Journalists' Syndicate has set up a committee to monitor occupation-related crimes. This committee investigates ongoing offenses against journalists in Gaza, the West Bank, and South Lebanon, including documented instances of direct targeting during field coverage and attacks on journalists' residences in the occupied Palestinian territories. 

They are also forming language-specific documentation groups and encouraging journalists and concerned individuals to participate in monitoring Western media for bias in their coverage of the Gaza conflict. A press conference, scheduled for Monday, October 16, at 1:00 PM, will reveal initial findings of unprofessional practices in Western media during the Gaza conflict.

The special flights are part of the operation launched on October 12 to facilitate the return of those Indian nationals who wish to return home following the brazen attacks on Israeli towns by Hamas militants from Gaza on October 7.

The Indian Embassy in Tel Aviv earlier earlier announced that two special flights will operate from Ben Gurion airport on Saturday.

The first flight left around 5.40 pm local time. The second flight with 274 Indian nationals took off at 11.45 pm local time.

The third batch of 197 Indian nationals left for home around 5.40 pm local time (8.10 pm IST).

""#OperationAjay moves forward. 197 more passengers are coming back to India,"" External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar posted on X.

The Embassy of India in Israel posted on X,""As part of #OperationAjay, Indian nationals still in Israel and wishing to travel back to India are urgently requested to complete the attached travel form.""

The Indian Embassy also issued guidelines that "" travel slots will be allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis in the 'Operation Ajay' and ""In the event of a no-show or refusal to travel after confirmation and slotting, your name will be moved to the back of the queue.""

""The Embassy has been working round the clock to facilitate all our citizens in Israel who wish to leave. We have reached out to students, caregivers, and business people. Some of them are actually working with us as volunteers. We urge everyone to remain calm,"" Ambassador Sanjeev Singla told PTI.

""The Embassy has emailed the next lot of registered Indian citizens for two special flights today. Messages to other registered people will follow for subsequent flights,"" the Indian Embassy in Israel posted the announcement on X earlier in the day.

Hundreds of Israelis have been killed, thousands injured and dozens still held hostage by Hamas, young children included. Israel's ongoing retaliation has left hundreds of Palestinians dead, at least 90 children among them, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. And humanitarian groups are warning of a coming crisis if Israel follows through on its vow to cut off food, water and electricity to Gaza, where nearly half of residents are under 18 years of age.

The news is alarming for anyone ‚Äî and especially for children, who may be left grappling with questions about why other children are among those affected, and whether they are safe. Here's some advice on how to get started with talking to kids about the conflict."" https://loom.ly/N50tfO4

Australia is providing an initial $10 million in humanitarian assistance for civilians affected by the conflict in Gaza.

Australia will provide $3 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to fund urgent needs like restoring essential services and providing medical support to victims of the conflict.

Through United Nations agencies, Australia will provide $7 million to deliver critical support including emergency water, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene services, as well as child protection.

Australia will continue to monitor and assess the humanitarian situation and stands ready to provide further support.

Quote attributable to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Penny Wong:

‚ÄúWe have seen devastating loss of innocent life since the heinous attacks on Israel by brutal terrorist group Hamas.

‚ÄúFar from representing the Palestinian people, Hamas undermines Palestinian needs and aspirations.

‚ÄúWe continue to call for the unconditional release of all hostages. We stand with Israel and reiterate its right to defend itself.

‚ÄúPresident Biden has called on Israel to operate by the rules of war in its response to Hamas attacks - we join him and others in that call.

‚ÄúWe call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

‚ÄúWe call for the establishment of a corridor to enable humanitarian needs to be met. And we support the work of the United States, Egypt and others towards this goal.

‚ÄúAdherence to international humanitarian law must be prioritised - including the protection of civilians, wherever they live.‚Äù

Quote attributable to Minister for International Development and the Pacific, the Hon Pat Conroy MP:

‚ÄúAustralia‚Äôs contribution through our trusted partners supports the humanitarian crisis affecting civilians caught up in this conflict.

‚ÄúOur assistance will prioritise the immediate needs of civilians, ensuring support reaches those most in need.

‚ÄúWe call for the protection of, and unimpeded access for, humanitarian workers who are delivering lifesaving support.‚Äù",,38,"{'like_count': 37, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 1612}",Australian High Commission Malaysia,,2023-10-15 06:32:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/355125624_232542609639928_4897325414267710462_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=xyq1JG8j8B4AX9KG3PR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC4mgBAT-tNX1iSM_CYkU6gPVPThJ2Khz_Fpn71xVF1XA&oe=655ACD90,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyaNX8fpQg_/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391398350_694181585648808_2430991435769107923_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=blTctVg3zs8AX8PZvW_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCoUKH6G4dMQsg5-KM5xML-O3CtBpUAL30XBbc4KVmUEg&oe=65593919

instagram,"My grandparents lived through the Spanish Civil War. My Abuelita woke up to bombings next door and lost friends and family. 

My grandfather would go on to fight on the battlefield and then spent a long time in one of the dictator Franco¬¥s concentration camps. He developed anxiety, claustrophobia, and PTSD.

That¬¥s largely the reason why I¬¥m bilingual and bicultural - my dad came to the U.S. at 16 because times were dire in Spain. 
‚Ä®Eventually, we moved back to Madrid when I was a kid and I grew up and lived through the transition from a dictatorship to democracy, a failed coup d¬¥etat and terrorism - Supermarkets, buses, and train stations bombed killing innocent people. We learned to keep on going through it all. 

But back then there was no social media to amplify any of it. Now we have access to images of war and terrorism and lost lives. 

Along with that, for those of us not actually in the area of the conflict, which is of course a privilege, there is a threat to our mental health. 

Here are some things we can do to preserve it in a world that spreads news like wildfire and everything coexists - our need to keep on going and our desire to be empathetic and compassionate:

- Routine is Key: When the world outside feels unpredictable, maintaining a daily routine can provide a comforting semblance of order.‚Ä®
- Stay Physically Active: Physical activity can act as a natural antidepressant by releasing endorphins, the body's feel-good chemicals.‚Ä®
- Journaling: Writing down feelings can be a therapeutic way of processing and understanding emotions.‚Ä®
- Limit or Erradicate Substance Use: While it might be tempting to use substances like alcohol as a coping mechanism, overreliance can lead to further mental health complications.‚Ä®
- Hold onto Hope: Remind yourself of moments of resilience and strength, past challenges you've overcome, and that this too shall pass.‚Ä®
Given the dual stresses of global conflict and inner discord, it's more important than ever to be compassionate and patient with yourself. 

Seek out resources and communities that resonate with peace and understanding, and always prioritize your mental well-being. How are you doing that?

Vanessa is the tertiary villainess of the 1989 film of The Little Mermaid. She was the name of the human persona that Ursula transformed into leading to the climax of the second act, creating conflict in the third act, ""the end"" of The Little Mermaid to stop Ariel from fulfilling the deal with Eric. She was the sly fianc√©e of Prince Eric for a day, an attractive woman who briefly becomes the center of the plot and became a fan favorite character.

instagram,"For me it does not take courage. Because this is personal, But for whoever is reading this around the world, I want you please to consider this: 
I will share from my personal perspective. 
I was born and raised in Israel , in Tel Aviv ; I was never much raised in anyway religious, many times, I felt very disconnected, and I could not understand why are even trying to protect our land, why not move anywhere else, and so I did. I‚Äôm living in Australia.. I‚Äôm living in Costa Rica.. just cause I was lucky enough to make those choices. 
all I wanted in life of is to be surrounded by nature, and in peace. 
With my fellow humans, with animals. my parents are very much Patriotic and most of my life I was having hard time with that. 
I criticised my country for many years, and I still criticise the current government, I feel that they are very much responsible for what‚Äôs going on right now. we do not deserve this kind of leadership, and they do not represent the beautiful people of Israel, and if you‚Äôve been following the news these past months, you know that hundred and hundred of people, March the street of Israel day and night, to oppose and change the current government. 
I am very sorry to say this , but over the last days is the last week, everything changed. I am very sorry to say that I am very scared of what‚Äôs coming.
We are at the threshold of a major conscious shift, as it has been told by Kali Yuga from 2020-2025 the world will reach an extreme hate and violence , before people will awaken to their true divine nature. 
so right now people in the west think it‚Äôs a conflict in the Middle East - but I‚Äôm very sorry to say that you will only understand once you will personally suffer‚Ä¶ from loss , from hatred. 
Innocent children have been brainwashed to hate, to believe in a painful illusion, I do have a lot of compassion to innocent people both in Gaza and around the world. I am just so sorry that they are falling to the hand of dark powers. 
If you are truly people of peace , of freedom, of love
You will keep your eyes open , and be very vigilant‚Ä¶ because this is only the beginning‚Ä¶ I love you all, despite what you might think of me

Last Oct 7, we set off on a trip to the Holy Land, starting with Egypt. We saw the Pyramids and witnessed their rich culture. Unfortunately, our journey was cut short due to the conflict in Israel. We hold onto hope for future travels to Israel and Jordan when peace allows.

Some pilgrims from our tour still managed to push through to Israel and Jordan. Thank God they are safe and sound and still continuing their trip as I write this. I think 12 of us decided not to continue anymore. I don't regret this decision at all... Not continuing our travel at the time of war is not a sign of weak faith. I know God understands this.

This move aims to deter hostile actions and reaffirm Washington's commitment to Israel's security. President Biden, while advocating for civilian protection, engaged with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority leader Mahmud Abbas. Israel is poised for a potential ground offensive against Palestinians in Gaza, with over one million people ordered to evacuate, raising concerns of a humanitarian crisis. The U.S. emphasizes the importance of civilian protection and addressing the worsening situation in Gaza as the conflict continues.

instagram,"Welcome to relationship conflict season! Otherwise known as the Libra eclipse! üåò‚ôéÔ∏è‚Å£
I have been witness and apart of some interesting conflicts lately. And it is so interesting to just witness them as they occur:

I saw a volleyball player blame the loss of a game on a fellow player (who got 5 points single-handedly in one game). That player was reflecting the loss and rejection he felt onto the other player.

I had a family member very upset with me that I didn‚Äôt call or ask about how they were. The abandonment they felt many times in their life was reflecting back to them through me.

I have witness a dear client getting so upset with the atrocities in the news, as a reflection of her helplessness to help people who are innocent even in her own life.

I have a beautiful client trying to reconcile a marriage, but her husband is caught in deep shame and continues to reflect his shame and unworthiness on her every time she attempts a loving gesture.

We will continue have our wounds reflected back to us until we heal them.

For example, if my family member had reached out and said ‚Äúhey! I was thinking about you!‚Äù I would have been so excited to talk to them. But instead it was ‚Äúyou never contact me‚Äù. That‚Äôs right, I don‚Äôt. Because I am busy with my own life. I rarely reach out to people, because my plate is overflowing. But to an unhealed person, that is feels like abandonment, because she already had an abandonment wound. Said another way, she has anxious attachment. So when someone doesn‚Äôt call, she feels like she did something wrong, or that she is not worthy to be chosen. And that certainly was not the case.

So the question is what is being reflected back to you? What are you experiencing that is hurting your heart? Where does that wound really come from? Because it isn‚Äôt outside of you. It always starts from within. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",,29,"{'like_count': 25, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 3259}",Sheetal Story,,2023-10-15 23:02:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/22344832_351726595239977_8280721032864595968_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=N7Qr1DGeMCkAX-SmC-X&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB5eYTPZM7tyeSwlHm4IZLiVtkb9-RSIbXoZM96QwkJ8w&oe=655A255A,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyb-pKzO1VZ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/391371633_257565653946895_7838433361409903306_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=iSTPJ6_IfdwAX8dvd_Y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD9d4MnJ17gKqUPTvAVHGEmjS-iVjfrPmHI11b3FrwZIA&oe=653B5EED

instagram,"As Israel considers launching an all-out offensive in Gaza, the presence of hostages and the risk of a broader regional conflict loom large. The situation is further complicated by the evolving humanitarian crisis in densely populated Gaza, with concerns about urban warfare and civilian casualties. The potential for a multi-front war involving Hezbollah and Iran-backed groups adds another layer of complexity. Israeli decisions in the coming days may reshape the region and have far-reaching consequences.

instagram,"Do you think AI is a threat or an opportunity for humanity? How do you think we should regulate and govern AI? Share your opinions in the comments below!

Dr. Geoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as the ‚Äúgodfather of AI‚Äù, has recently quit his job at Google and warned about the dangers of artificial intelligence. He said he was concerned about the potential for AI to surpass human intelligence and control humanity. He also said he regretted his work on neural networks and deep learning, which have enabled the development of powerful AI systems like chatbots.

Hinton said that chatbots could soon overtake humans in the amount of general knowledge and reasoning they possess. He also said that chatbots could be used for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation, manipulating elections, or creating sub-goals that conflict with human interests. He said that AI posed an ‚Äúexistential risk‚Äù to humanity and that he wished he had never started working on it.

Hinton‚Äôs views are shared by some other prominent figures in the field of AI, such as Elon Musk, who has warned about the possibility of AI creating a ‚Äúdigital superintelligence‚Äù or a ‚Äúdigital god‚Äù. However, not everyone agrees with Hinton‚Äôs pessimism. Some argue that AI can be beneficial for humanity if it is aligned with human values and ethics. They also point out that AI can help solve some of the biggest challenges facing the world, such as climate change, poverty, or disease.

instagram,"ü•≥ Today is Ella Belle's 12-ish birthday! 

We adopted Ella on my birthday and the vet estimated that she was between 18 months to two years old, so we just went with two years old and gave her my birth date so we could celebrate together. 

I suspect she's on the younger end of the age curve though. She's still very healthy and spry!

When we got her, neither Woody nor I were home much and I think Eve was a bit lonely after our cat Toby had passed on. Eve wasn't a fan of other dogs, so I wasn't sure getting a second dog was the best idea, but I saw this little one's photo on Petfinder and just had to have her. She was a last minute death row rescue and came with a lot of psychological baggage, fear, and PTSD, but after a few days, she and Eve clicked like magic and they were best friends with never a dispute between them until Eve left us.

Ella's never been quite the same since her bestie passed, but we love this little weirdo very much.

She was such a good big sister when we brought her home a little puppy companion named Abigail Rose to keep her company when we knew Eve would not be with us much longer. Eve showed little Abby the ropes too, but it was Ella who played with her, snuggled her, and loved her until one day the little one had become the biggest of them all and declared herself the queen. Even then, Ella quietly became Abigail's loyal servant though their relationship has not always been as free from conflict as we all would like.

Ever steadfast, my little shadow and protector, I love my little Ella Belle and wish her many more years with us üíô

instagram,"The recent attack in Gaza resulted in the tragic loss of journalists, with at least six journalists losing their lives, including Issam Abdallah, and several others injured. The attack, involving a tank shell, struck the journalists directly, despite their clear identification as press members. This highlights the perilous conditions journalists face in conflict zones, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding press freedom and the safety of media professionals. In a separate development, MSNBC's suspension of three Muslim anchors' shows amid rising tensions following an attack by Israel has raised concerns about potential religious targeting, although the network denies any such sidelining.

instagram,"STARTS TOMORROW! Follow the #VirtualBookTour for In Truth, Madness by Imran Khan @Imranism  @breakthrough_book_collective 

The perfect read for Neil Gaiman fans. 

Meet Malek Khalil, a brilliant reporter with decades of experience in the field, and a man on the edge. Where there is war, natural disaster or political crisis, Malek is in the midst of it, but years of conflict reporting have taken their toll and he is slowly unravelling. 
His colleagues, Neeka and Justin, have noticed a change in him, beyond even his usual vivid imagination. Neeka is especially sensitive, having been his friend and producer for many years, and perhaps knowing him better than he knows himself. Justin, a skilled and brave cameraman, has worked with them for just as long and the three make a formidable team - but they are only as strong as each other - and Malek is fast going down the rabbit hole.

Born a Muslim but an atheist to his core, Malek's voyage takes him around the world and back in time to ancient Babylon, as he finds himself arguing with a God in whom he does not believe. A keen reader, his 'madness' is heightened by a strange book that keeps appearing on his Kindle, telling the stories of people he has briefly encountered during his career.

In Truth, Madness takes place in the Middle East, South Asia and London against a backdrop of war, religion, political skullduggery and emerging love, taking the reader on a tumultuous journey through the most dangerous arenas of modern culture and the ancient world. 

Is Malek losing his mind, or is he experiencing an astonishing kind of truth? 

Our hosts tomorrow will be @fatguyreading and @jlreadstoperpetuity

Credit to @thekoreaherald A total of 192 South Korean nationals returned home early Wednesday from Israel, where tensions are escalating amid an armed conflict between the Jewish state and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.

A Korean Air plane carrying them arrived at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, at 6:08 a.m., after departing from Tel Aviv at 1:45 p.m. the previous day.

It is the first flight that has brought South Koreans back home since the conflict erupted Saturday when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel.

A Divided Duty by Ben Vizard

BLURB

1939. 

Declared unfit for active service after the Great War, Richard Hansen feels rudderless and out of place. But when the unthinkable happens and the shadow of a new conflict looms, he is thrust into enemy territory once again for a final, covert mission. 

Devastated and mourning her own catastrophic losses, his wife Emily is alone and adrift in a once-idyllic marriage grown cold and distant. When one day a surprise visitor comes calling she is faced with a choice that may grant her the very thing she has always longed for‚Ä¶ or lead her into terrible danger. 

As Europe goes to war a second time and Richard and Emily‚Äôs paths are wrenched apart, each must confront the ghosts of their own past, battling forces both seen and unseen as their lifelong love is tested to its limits - by duty, grief, time, and betrayal.

REVIEW

I adored A Painful Duty which was book one in this series, so I was so keen to read and review this second book, and, it didn't disappoint in the slightest, in fact, I think I would say this was even better than the first.

It is well written with a compelling story line that continues seamlessly from the end of the first book, and well developed characters that I liked even more in this book and felt like I got to know them even better. It is easy to see that the books in this series have been researched so well, there is so much that is factually correct, however, it isn't bogged down with facts so it feels like a chore to read. It is the perfect bled of fiction marrying with fact to make a perfect read.

This is definitely a heartbreaking read that will have you reaching for the tissues more than once, but trust me it is so worth it.

instagram,"Failure to conduct end-use monitoring could expose U.S. officials to International Criminal Court liability for aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes
(Washington D.C., October 15, 2023) ‚Äì U.S. law requires the United States to monitor the weapons and munitions it provides to Israel and ensure they are not used to commit war crimes in Gaza, Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN) reminded Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III in a letter sent Friday, October 13, 2023. Failure to comply with end-use monitoring requirements not only breaches U.S. laws but also could expose U.S. officials to prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for aiding and abetting war crimes, DAWN warned.

In a separate letter to ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan on Friday, DAWN asked the Prosecutor urgently to issue a public statement reminding the parties to the conflict of the ongoing investigation there and send an investigative team to the Gaza region of Palestine to document and investigate potential crimes under the Rome Statute.

üåé University of Exeter, UK üåé

At the University of Exeter, my short-term exchange program saw me in an ‚ÄòInternational Relations: Security, Conflict and Peace‚Äô unit. This academic experience enriched my understanding of global security and offered crucial insights into subjects such as nuclear disarmament and asymmetric warfare. The skills and knowledge acquired from this unit are directly relevant to diplomatic dialogue and conflict resolution within the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Exeter is a town with its own unique charm. The Imperial, or ‚ÄòImpy‚Äô, was where we went for drinks, especially to enjoy the spacious beer garden during the United Kingdom‚Äôs 2022 summer heatwaves ‚Äì a typical summer by Australian standards. 

üåé Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan üåé

The extensive academic and cultural exposure I received in Italy was invaluable for my understanding of European diplomacy and politics. 

Back in Australia, my studies often framed the European Union as a distant political entity, dissected through the lens of external perspectives. Sitting in a classroom in Milan, however, I could appreciate the tangible impacts of European Union governance, laws, and regulations.

üåé Mahidol University, Thailand üåé

My time in Thailand during a short-term exchange program offered a unique cultural immersion. This provided a cornerstone for understanding the societal intricacies crucial for diplomacy. This academic adventure bolstered both my formal and informal skill sets, especially in the area of cross-cultural communication, a vital skill for Australia‚Äôs diplomatic efforts in the Indo-Pacific region. Supported by the New Colombo Plan, this experience aligns with its objectives of uplifting Indo-Pacific capability in Australian graduates.

üåé What‚Äôs next? üåé

A United Nations Headquarters Study Tour in Geneva with the United Nations Association of Australia (Victoria Division), and Masaryk University in Czechia.

instagram,"Repost @stevendonziger THERE is a dangerous development in the campaign to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for damage caused by climate change.

While the war between Israel and Hamas consumes the world's attention, the fossil fuel industry is quietly working to delay and sabotage legal proceedings in the US to hold it accountable for its leading role in creating global warming. There are about 25 legal cases pending in US courts brought by cities and states against the oil majors and the industry lobbying group The American Petroleum Institute.

The fossil fuel industry's latest gambit is to try to dismiss these cases by arguing the industry is not responsible for the massive damage caused by climate change because it had no ""duty to warn"" the public. Industry lawyers cynically claim oil companies had no ""duty to warn"" because knowledge of climate change was available decades ago -- even though oil majors like Chevron and Exxon tried to deceive the public by hiding that very information. They did this by suppressing their own internal scientific research pointing to inevitable and drastic climate change, while at the same time paying lobbyists at front groups like the Heartland Institute to create ""uncertainty"" about the issue in public.

A mastermind of the new industry legal strategy is none other than Ted Boutrous of Gibson Dunn, the same fossil fuel law firm Chevron paid to orchestrate my private corporate prosecution after we helped Indigenous peoples in Ecuador's Amazon win a historic $10 billion pollution judgment. Boutrous also represents the New York Times in its media and First Amendment work ‚Äì a clear conflict of interest for the newspaper which might help explain why it never covered Chevron's orchestration of my illegal 993-day detention in retaliation for winning the Ecuador pollution case. Boutrous himself was intimately involved in the targeting of me and the affected Amazon communities of Ecuador.

On this Rural Women's Day, we honour the strong and resilient women living in conflict-affected villages. Their determination and courage fuel their success against all odds.

We're proud that our #EU4Dialogue initiative supports these incredible women, fostering their professional growth, entrepreneurial achievement, and personal development.

As Nana Tskrialashvili from Bershuaeti village says, ""This project convinced me that I can be strong. I'm already a fighter, but now I have even more new ideas.""

Ekaterine Kobaladze from Khurvaleti village notes: ""This project taught me how to stand by people and inspire hope in one another.‚Äù

Through the EU4Dialogue initiative, @euingeorgia and UNDP champion local civic endeavours that empower rural women and youth and benefit hundreds of people across Georgia.

instagram,"Unforgiveness causes conflict and creates obstacles in your relationship with God. It also undermines your connection with Him and sets you against those who could assist you. Forgiveness is the ultimate key to a life filled with power. 

One's ability to forgive quickly is a clear indicator of their knowledge of God. Whenever you seek God's mercy, He instructs you to begin with forgiveness. Unforgiveness leads to a failure of grace and inflicts more harm than the devil ever could.

Unforgiveness tarnishes your grace amidst blessings. Inability to forgive signifies a lack of understanding of God, as Christianity is founded on forgiveness. Unforgiveness squanders offerings and sacrifices and perpetuates poverty. It hinders your access to financial blessings.

Unresolved conflicts among individuals lead to conflicts between you and God. Bitterness is unproductive, and no one is deserving of hatred. Unforgiveness blinds you to any goodness in others.

Genuine forgiveness is evident when you harbor goodwill, are willing to reconcile, abstain from gossip and revisiting past offenses, extend kindness, and think and speak positively about those who have wronged you. When you continue to act and live as you did before, never harboring resentment, it reflects true forgiveness.",,19,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 19, 'num_users': 138975}",Korede Komaiya,,2023-10-15 11:37:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/197824680_170753604994816_8517411276266695880_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JYkuoON31s4AX-O8ILj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBHZw5_Qe6i9kTfVs-aaZoydtBWWzk2xWljROKyn97O6A&oe=6559E20D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyawR3zNr9B/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391732652_18286246813181783_734588530132204840_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=IXQYqLvwhN8AX-uQ3nm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAmoZjFGAKXWD3c4x78vkk_oSJcd03Bg3Az5ET82okHZQ&oe=65402363

Some of the most important lessons our students will learn are lessons that are not about the topic on our syllabi.

Teach basic definitions. Pause lesson plans.

As the nation's largest welfare charity, our mission remains unwavering - to provide essential support to children in need, especially during the turmoil of war.

üíî Regrettably, the recent conflict has brought immeasurable grief to countless families, with the brutal actions of Hamas casting a long shadow of sorrow. In response, Migdal Ohr initiated ""Israel's Shield,"" an emergency relief effort, with an unwavering commitment to safeguard those who are most vulnerable.

üè† We've relocated over 1,500 people, including children and babies, from the embattled Kibbutzim in the South, offering them not just shelter but also the solace of food, transportation, and grief counselling.

Asiza received a ShelterBox tent, which, while a blessing, doesn't alleviate all her concerns. Life in the camp remains challenging, with limited opportunities for her family to earn income, food security worries, and the urgent need for her children's education.

Do these black lives matter? 

All of you lying, psychotic, ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù enemies of humanity, in academia, in the media, and everywhere else, get ready to face your shame. 

You worthless, radical Left, children of the devil, and enemies of truth. 

They say, ‚Äúend the apartheid in Israel.‚Äù

I say, ‚Äúend Islamic terrorism and the lies and propaganda from psychotic liberals, who are children of the father of lies, that spew falsehood out of their vile hearts and mouths to defend the most evil people in the world.‚Äù

This conflict in Israel is revealing many things all over the world about people‚Äôs true colors. Isn‚Äôt it funny how liberal ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù women, who supposedly stand for female empowerment, consider a nation where women carry around machine guns to be the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù and a nation where men control women like slaves to be the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù? Are the black women of Israel wielding machine guns not a symbol of female empowerment? But you won‚Äôt hear the brainwashed freaks of the ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù social justice movement talk about this at the universities or on MSNBC, thats for sure! Because they would rather defend Islamic terrorists that murder babies and rape women, and not only defend them, but to organize big rallies and passionate protests to defend them. As if defending Islamic terrorists was the most important cause on earth! What these foolish and ignorant university students who think they are wise don‚Äôt understand is that they are being groomed and brainwashed by Muslim Nazis.

God bless democratic Israel and it‚Äôs diverse population of citizens from all over the world that just want peace and to not be subjected to Islamic terrorism. 

And God bless the Israeli Army which includes a significant number of African-Israeli (mostly of Ethiopian descent) brothers and sisters who are courageously fighting against the vile terrorist savages of Hamas who are not only a threat to Israel but to all of humanity. Thank you for removing evil from the world. 

May the Lord Jesus protect you and may the right hand of God Almighty strengthen you. 

Amen

instagram,"Israeli Ground Forces Set To Strike Hamas-Controlled Gaza Strip

Israeli forces are preparing for a ground assault in Gaza as the country hit back for an unprecedented attack on its territory.
Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht has urged civilians in northern Gaza, where Hamas's leadership is based, not to delay in getting out.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""more is coming"" in Israel's response to Hamas's shock attack last week, according to a video released by his office. ""Are you ready for what is coming? More is coming,"" Netanyahu, wearing a flak jacket, was heard telling soldiers.
Some 1.1 million people - nearly half the population of 2.4 million - live in the north of Gaza, and aid groups have said forcing them to move is an impossibility as the war rages. With food, water, fuel and medical supplies running low because of an Israeli blockade, aid agencies are warning of an impending humanitarian crisis in Gaza. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the situation in Gaza as ""a dangerous new low"".
A potential Israeli ground invasion has also increased fears for the safety of the 150 hostages, including foreigners, that Israel said Hamas captured during its deadly rampage.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, which several Western governments, including the US, have proscribed as a terrorist organisation, and likened to the Islamic State group.
Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian yesterday praised the Hamas rampage as a ""historic victory"" that had dealt a setback to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hossein Amirabdollahian, at a meeting in Qatar's capital Doha, agreed to continue cooperation"" to achieve the group's goals, Hamas said in a statement.
US President Joe Biden and other world leaders, have however, warned against any country broadening the conflict.

instagram,"In the midst of recent events, my heart is torn for both sides. The enduring struggles of Palestinians over the years weigh so heavily on my conscience. However, the distressing reality unfolding in Israel today is undeniably barbaric and heart-wrenching. After much introspection, I can't ignore the ongoing suffering. 

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves a long history of grievances, territorial disputes, and differing narratives. Recent events can be triggered by various factors, including political decisions, regional tensions, and historical grievances.

It‚Äôs important to approach the situation with a nuanced understanding, recognizing the complexities and multiple perspectives involved. Assigning blame only to one party may oversimplify a deeply rooted and intricate conflict. Efforts toward peace and understanding are crucial for resolving the ongoing tensions in the region.

‚Å£
""I didn‚Äôt think so much about this in those glossy, glowy, early days of my marriage. In the beginning it was much more of a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants, figure-it-out-as-you-go adventure filled with trips around the world at a moment‚Äôs notice. And car sex. The idea of having a weekly meeting with my spouse, of using a spreadsheet for anything besides tracking my work expenses, would have seemed absurd and unsexy.‚Å£
But in search of a more equitable, a more fair, and a more palatable union, some couples are opening up about adopting the types of structures that have long existed in corporations and organizations to work in their partnerships.""‚Å£
‚Å£
This may feel 'unsexy' but the upside to this system is that everyone knows where they stand and what their responsibilities are.  No one person is on the hook to assign jobs or keep tabs. ‚Å£
‚Å£
In the work I do as a @fairplaylife couples coach, I help couples adopt systems that work for them to more fairly distribute the work and the mental load of parenting and managing a home.  It can alleviate so much resentment and conflict. ‚Å£

‚Å†
As news of the war in the Middle East dominates headlines, it is easy to feel lost in one-sided narratives. For this week‚Äôs episode of ""Informed,"" we provide you with two different perspectives on the conflict.‚Å†
‚Å†
Our first story comes from Marc Champion for @Bloomberg, who argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response plan to Hamas attacks is valid. However, he emphasises the need for a new cabinet to execute it effectively. He reflects on the importance of Netanyahu's imperative to follow his advice to prevent a broader war and safeguard his legacy in a complex regional landscape.‚Å†
‚Å†
Our second story is from Stephen M. Walt for @foreignpolicymag, who contends that Israel‚Äôs pursuit of victory in the Gaza battle won‚Äôt contribute to resolving the longstanding issues of injustice and vengeance in the region.‚Å†

It‚Äôs a departure from the investigative journalism of Patrick Radden Keefe (‚ÄúEmpire of Pain‚Äù) in that I initially grappled with the question of whether advocacy is an inherent function of journalism or if it should present the facts and let readers decide for themselves.

As a long-time Jerusalem resident, Thrall provides a unique perspective and gripping account of the tragic bus accident that claimed the lives of Abed's son, Milad, and his classmates, when their bus collided with a trailer and erupted in flames. He delves into the experiences of Abed and the other parents as they searched for their children in the aftermath.‚Å£
‚Å£
In an interview with TIME, Thrall makes a direct link between these experiences and the system of controls Palestinians endure, which he describes as ‚Äúgrossly unjust‚Äù:‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúThere's an elaborate system of color coded IDs that dictate who can go where even within the same family. There's a wall that snakes through and circles a community, ‚Ä¶ All of that is the everyday reality of all of these people, and they faced it on the worst day of their lives.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
I purchased the book, prior to the Hamas attack, based on recommendations from The New York Times and The New Yorker. Investigative journalism has always been a favored genre, and as a mother of sons, the theme of conflict rooted in the loss of a child struck a chord. ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚Å£Also, I've observed the Middle East conflict's ebbs and escalations, and the fraught negotiations for peace, followed by the assassinations of leaders like Anwar Sadat and Itzhak Rabin. ‚Å£
‚Å£
A line from Thrall‚Äôs interview that reverberates is his assertion that in the conflict, ""every American citizen is complicit.""‚Å£
‚Å£
The conflict, now, war, has created within me what Adam Grant aptly describes as ‚Äúempathetic distress‚Äù. Regardless of whose ‚Äúside‚Äù you are on, perhaps you are experiencing this, too? ‚Å£

Reminder:

Hamas is not Palestine or Gaza.

Hamas has been funded by and elevated into political ‚Äúpower‚Äù by multiple nations, including the U.S. and Israel.

Gaza is a city turned concentration camp with about 2 million refugees, about half of those being children under the age of 18.

Israel is not just ‚Äúfighting back against terrorist‚Äù they are bombing a city of HUMAN BEINGS that have been oppressed by Israel for 70+ years.

What can you do? 

Keep uplifting Palestinian voices and combating misinformation. A great organization to donate to if you have the financial resources is the @thepcrf 

If you do not have financial resources you can use your voice. Never underestimate the power of word of mouth. Inform yourself and then inform others.

instagram,"Of course he does. The man loves Terrorists. 

üìç Some prominent Republicans are distancing themselves from former President Donald Trump, after the current GOP frontrunner repeatedly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and offered unexpected praise for Hezbollah militants.

‚ÄúHamas, Hezbollah, Iran, the greatest state sponsor of terrorism, these are states and entities that are focused on wiping Israel off the face of the earth. That is neither smart nor good,‚Äù Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), who represents a district that voted for President Joe Biden by double digits, told NBC News‚Äô Kristen Welker on Thursday. ‚ÄúThis is a fight of good versus evil.‚Äú

In an interview with Fox News‚Äô Neil Cavuto on Thursday, Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said that ‚ÄúDonald Trump has to answer for Donald Trump‚Äôs comment,‚Äù before adding that ‚Äúweakness begets conflict. Where people see an opportunity, where they‚Äôre looking at ways to harm others, where they don‚Äôt see a strong United States, they see opportunity.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThat was a very terrible thing.‚Äù

Trump went on to say that he had ‚Äúa bad experience with Israel as president,‚Äù when his administration carried out a targeted airstrike in January 2020 to kill the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, leader of the paramilitary Quds Force, who was in Baghdad at the time. According to Trump, Netanyahu refused to help the U.S. carry out the airstrikes.

In his speech, Trump also described the actions of the militant group Hezbollah ‚Äî an Iranian-backed proxy group based in Lebanon that the U.S. and other governments have designated a terrorist group ‚Äî as ‚Äúvery smart.‚Äù

Many of Trump‚Äôs GOP rivals have condemned his remarks, calling them ‚Äúinhumane‚Äù and ‚Äúabsurd.‚Äù The White House called the comments ‚Äúdangerous and unhinged‚Äù in a statement on Thursday.
