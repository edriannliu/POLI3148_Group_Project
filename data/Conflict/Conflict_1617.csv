facebook,"Ending Violence God‚Äôs Way 16 Oct 2023 God‚Äôs promises are real and He calls upon us to understand that He is always willing to intervene in our world to help us and to bring healing, if we are ready to do what He asks. This is what God promises: ‚ÄúIf my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.‚Äù 2 Chronicles 7:14 We can influence the course of world events this very day, if we are ready to do three things: 1. We must have faith and believe that for God all things are possible. ‚ÄúAnd without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.‚Äù Hebrews 11:6 2. We must repent of our sins and stop offending God. ‚ÄúIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.‚Äù 1 John 1:9 3. We must pray and believe that God will answer us. ‚ÄúTherefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.‚Äù Mark 11:24 This very day there are so many innocent people that depend on our faith, on our true contrition and on our prayer to silence the power of evil in our world and to end violence and to create peace. If you are reading the news you know that the wars that are occurring have deep roots and change without God‚Äôs intervention is in my humble opinion impossible. We who have faith must call upon God for assistance for God can accomplish what we alone can never hope to do. God is Our Creator, God is Our Father, God is Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, God is the Holy Spirit that creates Faith, Hope and Love in our world. ‚ÄúBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.‚Äù Matthew 5:9 ""The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion."" Psalm 11:5 There are little children this very day whose safety and futures depend on our faith, on our true repentance and our prayer for God‚Äôs intervention. Imagine their eyes so full of tears. Imagine their parents desperate for assistance and let us be their lifeline to God! My heart breaks for the people caught in places of violence and war, and I am so grieved especially for the innocent little children and their parents. How do you explain this horror to a little child! How do you make them feel safe! How do you be strong when you feel desperate and without assistance! I invite you to join a Christian Peace Movement called A Peaceful Revolution in the Name of Jesus Christ. Christians all over the world are committing to being peacemakers by believing in the power of One Body of Christ praying together at the Hour of Mercy everyday! The Hour of Mercy is the Time Jesus died for us, 3pm. At this time we come to Jesus with humility, with contrite hearts and with hope that He will help us heal our world of hatred, injustice, violence and war. There will never be peace until God intervenes to make it so because man will always find a way to justify violence. Please imagine in your heart the tears of the little children caught in conflict zones and commit to pray for them everyday. The little ones have done nothing to warrant the horror that surrounds them! A Peaceful Revolution in the Name of Jesus Christ is a Mercy Movement that requires faith, prayer and love for all souls. We pray for God‚Äôs Mercy upon all souls. We pray for an end to hatred, for reconciliation between God and Man and for peace, hope and prosperity where all people can live respectfully with one another without fear and without threat of any form of violence.

facebook,"October 15, 2023 (Sunday) ‚ÄúWe came here with four key objectives,‚Äù Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Egypt: ‚Äúto make clear that the United States stands with Israel; to prevent the conflict from spreading to other places; to work on securing the release of hostages, including American citizens; and to address the humanitarian crisis that exists in Gaza.‚Äù Blinken has been traveling country to country in the Middle East since shortly after the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas fighters, who crossed into Israel and killed at least 1,300 people, of whom more than 1,000 were civilians, 30 were Americans, 12 were Thais, and 2 were French nationals. They also took 126 hostages, including not only Israelis, apparently, but also 8 Germans, 5 U.S. nationals, and 2 Mexican nationals. Retaliatory strikes by Israeli forces on Gaza since then have killed at least 2,670 people and displaced almost a million. Israel has stopped food, water, fuel, and electricity from getting to Gaza and has told the more than a million residents in northern Gaza to move south to clear the way for a military incursion. Israeli energy minister Israel Katz said the siege would continue until Hamas frees the hostages. About 500 U.S. citizens are in Gaza. The Biden administration has been pushing diplomacy to stop the crisis from spreading. On October 11, Blinken traveled to Israel, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and then to Jordan, where he met with the head of the Palestinian Authority that exercises limited government in the West Bank, Mahmoud Abbas. Then he went on to Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Virtually everywhere, he said, he found ‚Äúa shared view that we have to do everything possible to make sure this doesn‚Äôt spread to other places; a shared view to safeguard innocent lives; a shared view to get assistance to Palestinians in Gaza who need it, and we‚Äôre working very much on that.‚Äù Blinken emphasized that the U.S. will stand with Israel ‚Äútoday, tomorrow, and every day‚Ä¶in word and also in deed.‚Äù He noted that the U.S. has moved a second carrier strike group (CSG) to the Eastern Mediterranean. A CSG is a powerful, flexible group of about 7,500 sailors and Marines on a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, a replenishment ship (which carries oil and supplies), a cruiser, destroyers, and a submarine, as well as various aircraft. The U.S. maintains 11 CSGs. Two of them are now in the Eastern Mediterranean not as provocation, Blinken said, but ‚Äúas a deterrent. It‚Äôs meant to make clear that no one should do anything that could add fuel to the fire in any other place.‚Äù Sending two CSGs to the region is a strong statement, almost certainly designed to address threats by Iran that it will ‚Äúrespond‚Äù if Israel proceeds with a ground invasion of Gaza. Iran backs Hamas‚Äîalthough there is not yet evidence that Iranian officials directly helped plan the October 7 attack‚Äîand also backs Hezbollah, the militant group that controls southern Lebanon. Today, clashes broke out on the border between Israel and Lebanon as Hezbollah fired missiles into Israel and Israeli forces fired artillery back. Israel has ‚Äúthe right‚Äîindeed it has the obligation‚Äîto defend itself against these attacks from Hamas, and to try to do what it can to make sure that this never happens again,‚Äù Blinken said. But, he added, ‚Äú[i]t needs to do it in a way that affirms the shared values that we have for human life and human dignity, taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.‚Äù United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres implored Hamas to release the hostages immediately and Israel to grant ‚Äúrapid and unimpeded access‚Ä¶for humanitarian supplies and workers for the sake of the civilians in Gaza,‚Äù which ‚Äúis running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies.‚Äù These two issues must not become bargaining chips, he said. ‚Äú[W]e are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East.‚Äù Opening a gate between Gaza and Egypt would allow supplies to be brought in and would help to move refugees south, away from the northern areas Israel is expected to attack. Relief for Gaza‚Äôs people has been bottled up on the Egyptian side of the border as Israeli officials refuse to guarantee their forces will not bomb relief trucks out of concern they are carrying weapons. The U.S. has put strong pressure on Israel to reopen the water supply to Gaza, especially in the southern region since the influx of refugees was already stressing supplies, and today Israel did so, but observers say that without electricity and fuel, the pumping stations and the plants that take salt out of the water don‚Äôt work. The U.S. is also clearly working to get the U.S. hostages released, but officials will not talk about the details of that operation. Today President Biden appointed Ambassador David Satterfield as the U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues, charging him with bringing ‚Äúurgently needed (truncated)",,58797,"{'like_count': 41226, 'comment_count': 2300, 'num_users': 1767840}",Heather Cox Richardson,,2023-10-16 04:48:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/152566019_265607578267815_5779082459770226204_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=kj-wf3qTercAX-knlEh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCIkezmgiX22_p9-UMHZ6vud7cx8iN-SchKWu5lCT66Rg&oe=657D279E,https://www.facebook.com/100044557238708/posts/871544791007421,

facebook,"Calls for the forced displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza, and the continued targeting of unarmed civilians threaten a horrific humanitarian catastrophe. The #MuslimWorldLeague has issued several statements demanding de-escalation. Above all, we reject the targeting of civilians by any party involved in the conflict. We also warn against violating the sanctity of Islamic sites, and any practices that depart from rational behavior into recklessness and barbarism. Time and time again, we have seen how such actions only make things worse and undo progress. The international community cannot remain silent amid violations of all humanitarian and international laws and norms. The United Nations, in accordance with its charter, resolutions, and covenants, must bear collective responsibility towards protecting civilians, immediately stopping the escalation, lifting the siege on Gaza, and striving in all sincerity and seriousness to secure a just and comprehensive peace process to address the Palestinian issue. This issue is more urgent than ever. Delays in achieving a solution only benefit those who oppose peace and are responsible for prolonging the suffering.",,19363,"{'like_count': 14470, 'comment_count': 2110, 'num_users': 2941746}",Mohammed Al-Issa ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿßŸÑÿπŸäÿ≥Ÿâ,,2023-10-16 06:48:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/236948687_284793133413039_2965463140619103965_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=y5O9wnntf4IAX9Qfich&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD4muUJo0kZaa7BR830vT_rZDGV_D4PfbSrqN2Qi-UIHw&oe=655B12F5,https://www.facebook.com/100064168446852/posts/735037495311859,

facebook,"In the movie ""The Last Samurai,"" the character Ujio plays a significant role, representing loyalty, bravery, and martial prowess within the backdrop of Japan's tumultuous historical period. Ujio's character embodies the essence of a samurai, showcasing utmost dedication to his leader, Katsumoto Moritsu, and a readiness to do whatever it takes to protect Katsumoto and the values of the samurai. Ujio's character is not just about unwavering loyalty; he is also a remarkable swordsman and considered one of the finest warriors among Katsumoto's samurai. His combat skills are showcased in various intense battle scenes throughout the film. Ujio exhibits his martial talent and courage in these moments of action, revealing his role as a fierce protector of his people and their traditions. However, Ujio's character also experiences personal growth and inner conflict. At the outset, he adheres strictly to traditional samurai values and is deeply committed to preserving their way of life. Nevertheless, as the film progresses, Ujio confronts the internal struggle of balancing tradition with adapting to the changing society of Japan during the 19th century. One of the pivotal moments of the film is the clash between Ujio and the main character, Nathan Algren. This duel encapsulates the complexity of their characters and their approach to the situation. Ujio enters the duel with unwavering determination and courage, defending his honor and the honor of the samurai. Behind his confidence, however, lies the pressure of his role within Katsumoto's samurai and a desire to uphold their collective reputation. Nathan Algren, on the other hand, is not a traditional samurai but a former American soldier who has learned much about the art of swordsmanship and the samurai spirit from Katsumoto and his companions. In this duel, he doesn't fight merely for himself but to demonstrate respect and gratitude for the teachings of Katsumoto and the samurai. It's a challenge within himself to see if he can stand his ground against a formidable warrior like Ujio. This clash symbolizes the clash of cultures and complex emotions within the characters. At the start, their limited understanding of each other's culture and language leads to misunderstandings and conflicts. However, as they spend more time together, both Ujio and Algren learn and gain respect for one another. This interaction highlights a central theme of the movie: the potential for understanding and respect between different cultures, set against the backdrop of Japan's confrontation with tradition and modernization in the 19th century. In conclusion, Ujio's character in ""The Last Samurai"" represents more than just a loyal samurai; he embodies the spirit of the samurai, their unwavering dedication, and their martial prowess. His character arc, especially in the duel with Nathan Algren, illustrates the internal conflicts and personal growth experienced by both characters. Through this clash and their evolving relationship, the film conveys a message of potential understanding and respect between diverse cultures during a transformative period in Japan's history.

facebook,"Nestled in the heart of the picturesque Aveyron region of southern France, the Chateau de Najac stands as a timeless testament to the grandeur of the medieval era. This magnificent fortress, perched atop a rugged hill, overlooks the enchanting village of Najac with an air of regal authority, casting a mesmerizing spell over all who lay eyes upon it. Constructed in the 13th century during the tumultuous times of the Albigensian Crusade, the Chateau de Najac was not just a symbol of power but a guardian of a region rife with conflict. Its formidable stone walls, constructed to withstand sieges, rise majestically from the rocky terrain, each stone echoing centuries of history and power. As you approach the chateau, the very journey to its gates is an adventure through time, as you tread the very path that knights and noble ladies once walked, perhaps en route to or returning from the Crusade. Within the chateau's walls, the ambiance is nothing short of awe-inspiring. A tranquil courtyard, surrounded by well-preserved battlements, transports you back to the days when chivalry reigned supreme. The whispers of the wind and the echoing footsteps serve as a haunting reminder of all who have passed through these hallowed halls. Stepping into the chateau's interiors, you are enveloped by a sense of mystery and antiquity. Stone archways lead you into dimly lit chambers where the tapestries tell stories of valor and love, offering a glimpse into the courtly life of the Middle Ages. The great hall, with its vaulted ceilings and colossal hearth, exudes an aura of grandeur that only the noblest of feasts and gatherings could have filled. But it is from the highest tower of the Chateau de Najac that you are truly transported to another world. Ascend the winding staircase to be greeted by a panoramic vista that sweeps across the Aveyron landscape, just as it did when this fortress was both a stronghold and a refuge during its tumultuous history. In every corner of the Chateau de Najac, you can almost hear the echoes of battles won and lost, and the whispers of lovers who once sought refuge in its walls. This medieval masterpiece is more than a monument; it is a living, breathing testament to human history, offering a profound connection to the past that is both emotive and stirring. A visit to the Chateau de Najac is a journey through time, an encounter with the spirits of chivalry, and an opportunity to lose oneself in the enchanting story of France's medieval heritage.",,7573,"{'like_count': 6180, 'comment_count': 78, 'num_users': 165255}",Saving Castles,,2023-10-16 09:32:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/337648169_238121455256820_1442536507469052396_n.jpg?stp=c194.183.638.638a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=UijoK77m6UsAX8iJ2yE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCROKVa7WGomT5l49lrVu6G5KzcFtICi88ZRmO7Syjl8g&oe=655B531E,https://www.facebook.com/100070158695935/posts/618812270467391,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391738695_618812123800739_2498417559384972345_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=PopOwm1BQncAX_w1EbO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDKXyJWwzgidYsoJkd6C_PQ8cCzZowGxnC3Qt5lOgd8fg&oe=653135FD

Today, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi met with French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Catherine Colonna. The meeting was also attended by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sameh Shourky. Spokesman for the Presidency, Counselor Ahmed Fahmy, said both sides affirmed the importance of the strategic nature of the distinguished relations between the two countries across the economic, development and cultural fields, in addition to intensive coordination and consultation between the two sides, regarding various political and security files of common interest. This was reflected during the past days in terms of extensive calls between President El-Sisi and French President Emmanuel Macron, with the aim of supporting and safeguarding security and stability in the Middle East, the Mediterranean Basin and Africa. Views were exchanged on the latest regional developments, especially the military escalation in the Gaza Strip. The French minister of foreign affairs presented France‚Äôs view in this regard, while praising Egypt‚Äôs key role in dealing with this vital regional issue, with wisdom and responsibility, from various political and humanitarian aspects. Views were aligned on the gravity of the current situation and its threat to the region‚Äôs security and stability, as well as the need to prevent the expansion of the conflict, to protect civilians and prevent targeting them and to respect international humanitarian law. President El-Sisi highlighted the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities by providing an urgent humanitarian and relief aid to the people of the Strip and alleviating their suffering. The President stressed the need for de-escalation, as well as the rejection to expose civilians to policies of collective punishment, such as siege, starvation or displacement. The two sides also agreed on the importance of diligent international work towards settling the Palestinian issue by reaching a just and comprehensive solution, based on the two-state solution in accordance with the terms of reference of international legitimacy, so as to realize security and stability for all the peoples of the region.",,4169,"{'like_count': 2925, 'comment_count': 319, 'num_users': 2379927}",ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ÿ≠ÿØÿ´ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸÖŸä ŸÑÿ±ÿ¶ÿßÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖŸáŸàÿ±Ÿäÿ©-Spokesman for the Egyptian Presidency,,2023-10-16 08:53:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/328441906_909358313530689_6753333129130148843_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eHjJH8VKXdcAX8FFJ6b&_nc_oc=AQkz-ovPXPjNN9FGHjcE2gTOdWr2EhnAkTFzoZEb-dmM1r1g7Q6z08gVYdu6pv5O7YY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfChrQ0doEGmYFJpwy4OpzBVrRwPE-ylfgG3fOXqiAQVew&oe=6559EF70,https://www.facebook.com/100044362122571/posts/888344402654289,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393123968_888381029317293_1803934375524726538_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=MZ6aouLTMoAAX9yL2R5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCVRVCkLIaQ6mediS45MgWkOFbnFwkqmRkACQh_BV5DcQ&oe=6539D610

facebook,"Geronimo was an Apache leader and medicine man best known for his fearlessness in resisting anyone‚ÄìMexican or American‚Äîwho attempted to remove his people from their tribal lands. He repeatedly evaded capture and life on a reservation, and during his final escape, a full quarter of the U.S. standing army pursued him and his followers. Here are some interesting facts about Geronimo that you may not know: 1. The origins of his name are disputed. The man who would become the most feared Indian leader of the 19th century was born sometime in the 1820s into the Bedonkohe, the smallest band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe that inhabited what is now New Mexico and Arizona. His given name was Goyahkla (‚ÄúThe One Who Yawns‚Äù), but as a young man he earned the moniker ‚ÄúGeronimo‚Äù after distinguishing himself in Apache raids against the Mexicans. The source of the name remains the subject of debate. Some historians believed it arose from frightened Mexican soldiers invoking the Catholic St. Jerome when facing the warrior in battle, while others argue that it was simply a Mexican nickname or a mispronunciation of ‚ÄúGoyahkla.‚Äù 2. Geronimo‚Äôs wife and children were murdered when he was a young man. Geronimo came of age during a period of bitter conflict between the Chiricahua Apaches and the Mexicans. In response to the Apaches‚Äô penchant for staging raids to gather horses and provisions, the Mexican government had begun ambushing Apache settlements and offering lucrative bounties for their scalps. In 1851, while Geronimo and several other warriors were in the town of Janos on a trading mission, Colonel Jose Maria Carrasco and a detachment of around 400 Mexican soldiers ransacked his Bedonkohe encampment and slaughtered many of its inhabitants. When Geronimo returned later that night, he found that his mother, his wife and his three young children had all been murdered. 3. He broke out of U.S. Indian reservations on three different occasions. In the 1840s and 1850s, the Mexican-American War and the Gadsden Purchase placed the Chiricahua Apaches‚Äô domain within the boundaries of the expanding United States. Geronimo and the Apaches violently resisted the influx of white settlers, but following several years of war with the U.S. Army, they reluctantly negotiated a peace. By 1876, most of the Chiricahuas had been shipped to San Carlos, an arid and inhospitable reservation located in Arizona. Geronimo avoided the reservation until 1877, when he was captured by Indian agents and brought to San Carlos in chains. 4. He was an accomplished artist who sold paintings to tourists late in life. 5. He was also an accomplished horseman who could ride standing up on two horses at once. 6. He died at Fort Sill, Oklahoma on February 17th, 1909.",,3137,"{'like_count': 1898, 'comment_count': 238, 'num_users': 24005}",NATIVE AMERICAN DNA,,2023-10-16 11:33:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/344242572_741692697738927_3934511520961231530_n.jpg?stp=c14.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=PL6fnIlsVGAAX8G2fYV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCp-oXPU_5KMwL8yxO8zavKOcA-4jVsOcLPwJt_wyyN8A&oe=655AAD83,https://www.facebook.com/groups/519438296881992/permalink/601765941982560,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393209177_2969465509850177_1857575742959843711_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hir6ziSYMPgAX-ZwFMh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCCsix_qjvL2dRd82vELKgeoktn8y6mUIN_9Prpt2AdHw&oe=653A4325

facebook,"I am being attacked by another page and need to get on top of this before it gets out of hand. I hate drama and conflict so I really hope this puts out the fire and doesn't add to it, but I don't know what else to do. The derogatory and frankly dangerous things being Said about me are simply not true. I haven't been in contact with this person for over a year after blocking Their page because of being attacked by them in the past over RTN, the private Assessment company I partnered with after my Son was diagnosed by them. For some unknown reason this advocate has suddenly started attacking me again and Their friends are supporting them despite me being completely oblivious to what I have supposedly done. They are saying I've been bulling them, accused me of being transphobic (anyone who knows me, knows that's utterly not true) and dead naming, which if I did do, it was because I was unaware of any name change (name changes is Something I'm very supportive of which is why I changed my name) I have had problems with a few Autistic advocates in the past and have gone on the defensive and also blocked them. I know people say stuff about me behind my back, but there isn't much I can do about it, other than get on with my life and continue to be me. I'm also being lambasted for saying the words regressive advocates, which I didn't actually know the meaning of. I thought it meant angry for not agreeing. But this is not the case and for that I apologise profusely to anyone offended. I know I have a lot of support, but I have seen people crash and burn because of unfounded and hurtful accusations spreading and destroying lives. I don't deserve this, I was only ever trying to help Autistic people through my posts, my talks, my books and even my photography. So here is my message to this person üíï I'm very sorry we fell out. I was trying to protect my mental health and I took what you were saying last year as a personal attack on me and my integrity. I'm sorry if I dead named you, this was absolutely not deliberate and I honestly didn't realise it had happened. Please stop this, I honestly have no issues with you and even love your honesty and art. I miss when we were friends but I was really hurt which is why I blocked you. I watched the tick tock video threatening death (to I assume me) which has scared me beyond all reason. I have a family, I cannot understand why this was something anyone would think was OK to do. This situation has also hurt my wife and kids, who as you know are also Autistic and their anxiety is making them ill. Please, please, leave me alone, I haven't done anything to you and if some advocates are angry at me for things I've said, then I'm afraid I cannot please everyone, I can only do my best and block or delete anyone who sets off my RSD, trauma and depression. I respect anyone who tries to advocate for our community, but I that doesn't mean we have to agree about everything and when people say hurtful things or break down my posts looking for ways to pick at me, this sets off my rsd and I get defensive. I wish you all the happiness in the world despite whats happening, and I hope one day perhaps we can communicate in a friendly manner again. *To my supporters. Please know that I am not ok, I am very sick now and may take some time away from the Advocate side of this page, not definitely, but very possibly. I will continue to share my photography as it is the only thing that is keeping me from going down a deep hole of despair.",,2844,"{'like_count': 339, 'comment_count': 380, 'num_users': 96791}",Joe James The Autistic Photographer,,2023-10-16 09:17:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/393399153_872127454584790_7119614750391020429_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=J_q0rg8G804AX8lY5ks&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB033GCw_0ljm9uTL-fH60a-SWnCZuwOZwciHbgoYYKbw&oe=655AF92C,https://www.facebook.com/100053626292600/posts/871562917974577,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392937776_871562974641238_4378922294140184523_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=vDZ920z2SdMAX_L27Th&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBWwYANmUG2FtS4Uzz4XxCoagI1YIQq45lMJYwfNKBVsQ&oe=654D4C46
facebook,"We must win this war of souls. In its war against Hamas, Israel has a duty to defend its territory and its citizens, but it must also defend its humanity. Our war is with Hamas, not with the Palestinian people. Palestinian civilians deserve to enjoy peace and prosperity in their homeland, and even in the midst of conflict their basic human rights should be recognized by all sides. This refers not only to Israel, but also to Egypt, which shares a border with the Gaza Strip, and which has partially sealed that border. Right now, the minds of both Israelis and Palestinians are filled to the brim with their own pain, and no space is left to even acknowledge the pain of the other side. But outsiders who are not themselves immersed in pain should make an effort to empathize with all suffering humans, rather than lazily seeing only part of the terrible reality. It is the job of outsiders to help maintain a space for peace.

""But I will send a fire upon the wall of GAZA, Which shall devour its palaces. ""I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, And the one who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; I will turn My hand against Ekron, And the remnant of the Philistines shall perish,‚Äù Says the Lord God. Scripture can be so eeriely accurate as to raise hairs on one's head! Selah ü§î PS: And then someone says ati, it was written by men who sat down and elaborately invented all the stories and tales! A simple audit of the number of prophecies in that book that have come to pass alone numbers in the hundreds! How could someone writing from over 2,400 years ago be so accurate? How can some small group get so many events right, down to days and names? Let's be real! üßê PPS: I have been forced to add this. My sharing of the scripture above does not in any way that I... a) support the brutalization of any civilians on both sides of this conflict, such as witnessed by the horrible events that precipitated this retaliation, or the countless past events against the Palestinians by the Israeli IDF b) justify any ""genocide"" or ""extermination"" of any people, terms that have been thrown around in this conflict c) trivialize the great suffering that the Palestinian people have had to endure for decades under this occupation. d) justify the continued oppression of the Palestinians in that place. ü•∫",,2080,"{'like_count': 937, 'comment_count': 623, 'num_users': 189866}",Rev.

facebook,"Many in the mainstream media are already painting the narrative that any retaliation from Israel will be unwarranted and calls for ‚Äòpeace‚Äô will be on Israel‚Äôs shoulders. And if you don‚Äôt know the history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, you‚Äôre likely to believe that narrative. But history and context are important to understand. Calls for peace have been attempted for multiple times over the past few decades. Israel has made MULTIPLE concessions in an attempt to bring this conflict to an end. Every single time, however, those deals have been rejected by the Palestinian government. Why? Because there is no deal that can be made that Palestine or any other terroristic anti-Semitic group will agree with, other than the absolute destruction of the Jewish people. Israel has offered a two-state solution. It was turned down.

facebook,"There is some deep perversion in Britain whenever Israel is involved in a conflict And it is the word you just used - proportion. I've heard it in the last few days excessively. Proportionality in conflict rarely exists, but if we were to decide that we should have this fetish about proportionality then that would mean that in retaliation for what Hamas did in Israel on Saturday Israel should try to locate a music festival in Gaza for instance, and good luck with that, should try to find a music festival in Gaza and rape precisely the number of women that Hamas raped on Saturday, kill precisely the number of young people that Hamas killed on Saturday. They should find a town of exactly the same size as a town like Sderot, where I‚Äôve been many times myself, and make sure they go door to door and kill precisely the correct number of babies that Hamas killed in Sderot on Saturday and shoot in the head precisely the same number of old age pensioners as were shot in Sderot on Saturday. Just to choose one town. Proportionality in the conflict is a joke. ◊ô◊©◊†◊î ◊°◊ò◊ô◊î ◊¢◊û◊ï◊ß◊î ◊ë◊ë◊®◊ô◊ò◊†◊ô◊î ◊ë◊õ◊ú ◊§◊¢◊ù ◊©◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊û◊¢◊ï◊®◊ë◊™ ◊ë◊°◊õ◊°◊ï◊ö ◊ï◊ñ◊ï ◊î◊û◊ô◊ú◊î ◊©◊î◊©◊™◊û◊©◊™ ◊ë◊î- ◊§◊®◊ï◊§◊ï◊®◊¶◊ô◊î. ◊©◊û◊¢◊™◊ô ◊ê◊™ ◊ñ◊î ◊ë◊ô◊û◊ô◊ù ◊î◊ê◊ó◊®◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊ú◊ô ◊î◊§◊°◊ß◊î. ◊§◊®◊ï◊§◊ï◊®◊¶◊ô◊î ◊ë◊°◊õ◊°◊ï◊ö ◊ß◊ô◊ô◊û◊™ ◊ú◊¢◊ô◊™◊ô◊ù ◊†◊ì◊ô◊®◊ï◊™, ◊ê◊ë◊ú ◊ê◊ù ◊î◊ô◊ô◊†◊ï ◊û◊ó◊ú◊ô◊ò◊ô◊ù ◊©◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊ß◊ë◊ú ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊§◊ò◊ô◊© ◊ë◊†◊ï◊í◊¢ ◊ú◊§◊®◊ï◊§◊ï◊®◊¶◊ô◊î ◊ê◊ñ ◊ñ◊î ◊ê◊ï◊û◊® ◊©◊õ◊™◊í◊ï◊ë◊î ◊¢◊ú ◊û◊¢◊©◊ô ◊ó◊û◊ê◊° ◊ë◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™ ◊î◊ê◊ó◊®◊ï◊†◊î ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊î ◊ú◊û◊¶◊ï◊ê ◊§◊°◊ò◊ô◊ë◊ú ◊û◊ï◊ñ◊ô◊ß◊î ◊ë◊¢◊ñ◊î ◊ú◊ì◊ï◊í◊û◊î, ◊ï◊ë◊î◊¶◊ú◊ó◊î ◊¢◊ù ◊ñ◊î, ◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊î ◊ú◊û◊¶◊ï◊ê ◊§◊°◊ò◊ô◊ë◊ú ◊û◊ï◊ñ◊ô◊ß◊î ◊ë◊¢◊ñ◊î ◊ï◊ú◊ê◊†◊ï◊° ◊ë◊û◊ì◊ï◊ô◊ß ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊û◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊†◊©◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ó◊û◊ê◊° ◊ê◊†◊° ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™, ◊ú◊î◊®◊ï◊í ◊ë◊ì◊ô◊ï◊ß ◊ê◊™ ◊û◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊¶◊¢◊ô◊®◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ó◊û◊ê◊° ◊î◊®◊í ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™, ◊î◊ù ◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊û◊¶◊ï◊ê ◊¢◊ô◊® ◊ë◊í◊ï◊ì◊ú ◊û◊ì◊ï◊ô◊ß ◊õ◊û◊ï ◊î◊¢◊ô◊® ◊©◊ì◊®◊ï◊™, ◊©◊ë◊ô◊ß◊®◊™◊ô ◊ë◊î ◊§◊¢◊û◊ô◊ù ◊®◊ë◊ï◊™, ◊ï◊ú◊¢◊ë◊ï◊® ◊ì◊ú◊™ ◊ì◊ú◊™ ◊ï◊ú◊î◊®◊ï◊í ◊û◊°◊§◊® ◊ñ◊î◊î ◊©◊ú ◊™◊ô◊†◊ï◊ß◊ï◊™ ◊©◊ó◊û◊ê◊° ◊î◊®◊í◊ï ◊ë◊©◊ì◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™ ◊ï◊ú◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊®◊ê◊© ◊ë◊ì◊ô◊ï◊ß ◊ë◊ê◊ï◊™◊ï ◊û◊°◊§◊® ◊ñ◊ß◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊§◊†◊°◊ô◊ï◊†◊®◊ô◊ù ◊õ◊§◊ô ◊©◊†◊ï◊®◊ï ◊ë◊©◊ì◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™. ◊®◊ß ◊ú◊ë◊ó◊ï◊® ◊ë◊¢◊ô◊® ◊ê◊ó◊™. ◊§◊®◊ï◊§◊ï◊®◊¶◊ô◊î ◊ë◊°◊õ◊°◊ï◊ö ◊ñ◊ê◊™ ◊ë◊ì◊ô◊ó◊î. #HamasisISIS #IsraelUnderAttack #TheWorldNeedsToKnow #hamasmassacre *◊û◊™◊ï◊ö ◊™◊ô◊¢◊ï◊ì ◊©◊¢◊ú◊î ◊ë◊®◊©◊™◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ó◊ë◊®◊™◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ú◊§◊ô ◊°◊¢◊ô◊£ 27◊ê ◊ú◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊ñ◊õ◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊ï◊¶◊®◊ô◊ù.",,1766,"{'like_count': 970, 'comment_count': 353, 'num_users': 125988}",Israel Under Fire,,2023-10-16 06:39:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/392742691_705392948290042_2437324361957547144_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=seIgtsh_5FwAX_kc5Qw&_nc_oc=AQn3Ekcyr_aivGYZv4uAd-unj_A74o2zfBW4rFQPUqduKPwGo6MR5DRovk1IfRVH2FY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDKXyLu3ResUHipCc4frjNWECAgujZtQ7iv8W1kYJcLKw&oe=655A91C7,https://www.facebook.com/100064580294121/posts/705988521563818,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/389285334_1801182976982664_5851985440763708498_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=Rig8Wbzb33oAX-uANMY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBEn6Jm8mCPJW17WCyJMHzz_Z5b6OIzUoUewRtWfEz_YQ&oe=655609F7

facebook,"üó£Ô∏è Hey everyone, let‚Äôs talk about why checking in with your partner is so important for building a healthy, long-lasting relationship. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in our busy lives, but taking the time to check in can make all the difference. Here‚Äôs why it matters...‚úçüèæ ü§ù Open Communication: When we check in with our partner, we create a safe space for open and honest communication. It‚Äôs a chance to share our thoughts, feelings, and any concerns we may have. By actively listening and expressing ourselves, we deepen our understanding of each other and strengthen our bond. ‚ù§Ô∏è Emotional Support: Life can be tough, and checking in allows us to offer much-needed emotional support to our partner. It shows them that we‚Äôre there for them, ready to listen and provide comfort when they need it most. This kind of support nurtures the foundation of our relationship and helps us navigate through life‚Äôs challenges together. üîó Strengthening Bonds: Regular check-ins are an opportunity to nurture the bond we share with our partner. It‚Äôs a chance to appreciate each other, express gratitude, and celebrate the small moments that make our relationship special. By investing time and effort into our connection, we create a strong sense of security, trust, and intimacy. üíî Conflict Resolution: Let‚Äôs face it, conflicts happen in every relationship. Checking in allows us to address issues promptly and constructively. It‚Äôs a chance to talk openly about concerns, find common ground, and work towards resolution with love and respect. By tackling conflicts head-on, we build a stronger and healthier relationship. üå± Growing Together: People change and grow over time, and relationships should too. Regular check-ins provide an opportunity for personal and mutual growth. By sharing our dreams, aspirations, and individual goals, we support each other‚Äôs personal development while strengthening our connection as a couple.",,1706,"{'like_count': 797, 'comment_count': 46, 'num_users': 125433}",Relationship,,2023-10-16 21:23:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/304773095_409378291289995_7738804066655084220_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=9hlJM8lXgd8AX_BYo_0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBOf4wUqKC7XuCXk7EMkLwLqTFvh90gL1jXpTduclfwgg&oe=655B5CAE,https://www.facebook.com/100066534835404/posts/665481245679697,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391759678_665481209013034_321940749830726049_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jUWl_Lxg47kAX9ph0D7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAyDPClsv86oftVHYWAdmThuXmBfsNl4QN_wAHxpfyXkg&oe=653366BF

facebook,"Hi everyone. I thought I‚Äôd compile together as much as I could on Glorfindel, as one of the mightiest of Elves, and unique in that not only had he returned to Middle Earth from Valinor, he was also active in all the Three Ages of Middle Earth and possibly well into the Fourth Age too. Glorfindel also known as Laurefindel√´ in the Quenya tongue meaning ‚ÄúGolden haired‚Äù was one of the mightiest and valiant of all the Elves. He was born sometime during the Years of the Trees in Valinor and there is nothing known of his parentage except that he had kinship with Turgon. It is this and his allegiance to Turgon that compelled him to cross the Helcarax√´ to exile in Middle Earth, even though in his heart he was against leaving Aman and so took no part in the Kinslaying. Once entering Middle Earth he like other followers of Turgon settled in Vinyamar in Nevrast in West Beleriand just on the slopes of Mount Taras. While conflict continued with Morgoth‚Äôs armies it was after the Dagor Aglareb, the third battle of Beleriand in F.A. 60 that Turgon‚Äôs thoughts were drawn back to Tumladen Vale where Ulmo had guided him a decade earlier, and it was here in this very place that he built the Hidden City of Gondolin reaching completion in the year 116 of the First Age. Glorfindel who had always been loyal to Turgon was awarded chief of the House of the Golden Flower, one of the great noble houses of Gondolin, whose shields bore a rayed sun. His raiment was embroidered with Golden threads, decorated with Celandine and he became beloved by all the Gondolindrim. Having not participated in the previous battles, Gondolin within the hidden valley remained safe. However in F.A. 472 Glorfindel followed Turgon into battle at the plain of Anfauglith and upon the Fen of Serech to fight at the terrible and devastating Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where upon the battlefield waiting for their chance to act they finally broke through the lines of Orcs and met with the guard of Fingon, just before Morgoth was to unleash the full might of Angband upon them, including that of Glaurung. During the fight Glaurung became sorely wounded by Azagh√¢l the leader of the Dwarves of Belegost but was slain in the process forcing their army to leave the battlefield. This did not help Fingon and Turgon on the Western side so the battle went sour and the alliance was failing. Turgon‚Äôs and Fingon‚Äôs forces thus retreated to the Pass of Sirion with Glorfindel and Ecthelion both at the rear but they were set upon by Gothmog who fought Fingon in single combat. However another Balrog came and bound Fingon with his whip so he couldn‚Äôt move and so Fingon, elder brother of Turgon died by Gothmog‚Äôs black axe. Turgon and his host were now in trouble but if not for H√∫rin‚Äôs bravery and sacrifice this day enabling Turgon and his followers to flee back to Gondolin which still remained hidden from Morgoth, all would have been lost. Not much is written here of Glorfindel in this battle but I‚Äôm sure his sword and dirk counted towards many Orc deaths this day. For 38 years Gondolin remained safe but inner turmoils and dark deeds where upon Maeglin, having been captured by Morgoth, tortured and promised to have both the city and Idril who he secretly loved, gave away the city‚Äôs secret location. So it was in the year 510 Morgoth attacked Gondolin. Glorfindel was ordered to defend the Great Market area on the Eastern side of the city from advancing Orcs. His plan was to flank this invading army but he and his guard became ambushed. Surrounded by Orcs led by Balrogs they fought for hours until a fire-drake came at them and they had no choice but to retreat with the few survivors they had left. This dragon levelled this entire area with flame burning everything, all of its stores and wears. Turgon sent forth his Host of the Harp to help them but instead their leader Salgant in his cowardice led his men to the Lesser Market where he lived. There his soldiers started to fret and feared for Glorfindel‚Äôs safety, so they abandoned their leader. They arrived to aid Glorfindel in time but many of them perished within the fires that engulfed this area. Arriving at the city‚Äôs centre, The Square of the Palace, where great fountains had been built here to add to the beauty of this part of the city, they took refuge. Ecthelion who was Warden of the Great Gate was wounded and Galdor, Lord of the Folk of the Tree, was still engaged in battle which had enabled Tuor to bring Ecthelion here and Egalmoth, Lord of the Heavenly Arch had still to arrive. Glorfindel thus joined Tuor in defending the Square. They fought valiantly but could not prevent the Dragon that came upon them, breaking through their line of defence followed by Orcs and Balrogs including among this dark host, Gothmog. Ecthelion although wounded fought this threat so the others may find time to escape and in so doing killed Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, but in the process he too was slain. Turgon ordered those that survived to follow Tuor (truncated)",,1581,"{'like_count': 1183, 'comment_count': 117, 'num_users': 139260}",The Silmarillion,,2023-10-16 14:15:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/322482956_1208064803128517_8431455316351759258_n.jpg?stp=c14.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cctlzoeEmzIAX98XRlr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAW0akQbVZY5aobn5X7t54-sIbsqRpDjgHTfwpcEEUznQ&oe=6559D735,https://www.facebook.com/groups/150541086703/permalink/10160681642596704,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/384271088_10160092014573657_6598588814490411417_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fSgeY32YIogAX_GM0Nk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBhXeRdZj-H27-Y06jESGPXJWRVW3hzigTXIYaU9K4foQ&oe=65437474

facebook,"The scapegoat plays a crucial role in the intricate dynamics of narcissistic relationships. As the one with the potential to expose the narcissist's manipulation, deception, and lies, the scapegoat inevitably becomes the outcast of the social setting. This phenomenon occurs as a defensive mechanism the narcissist employs, aiming to protect their egotistical facade and maintain control over those around them. By designating the scapegoat as the outcast, the narcissist effectively deflects attention away from their own behaviour, redirecting it onto an innocent party. This ultimately allows them to continue with their exploitative tactics unchecked. The scapegoat, on the other hand, becomes burdened with the weight of the narcissist's transgressions, suffering the consequences of being excluded from social circles. The narcissist's manipulation, deception, and lies often manifest as a web of untruths expertly woven together. The scapegoat, however, possesses an innate ability to see through this veil of deception. Their astute observation skills and keen intuition grant them the insight required to pinpoint the narcissist's true nature. This insight threatens the narcissist's carefully constructed persona, making the scapegoat a dangerous individual who could dismantle their entire fa√ßade. In order to maintain their position of power and influence, the narcissist skillfully manipulates others into believing that the scapegoat is the instigator of conflict. By painting the scapegoat as untrustworthy, emotionally unstable, or even mentally ill, the narcissist successfully tarnishes their reputation and credibility. This ensures that any information or accusations brought forth by the scapegoat are swiftly dismissed or deemed invalid. In conclusion, the scapegoat's potential to expose the narcissist's manipulation, deception, and lies makes them a threat to the narcissist's carefully constructed image. As a result, the scapegoat is often shunned and labelled as the outcast, serving as a stark reminder of the narcissist's insidious tactics. This unfortunate circumstance perpetuates the narcissist's hold over their victims and enables them to continue their manipulative behaviour unchecked.

facebook,"Vanavond net na zeven uur heeft een gewapende schietpartij plaatsgevonden gericht op drie personen op de kruising van de Saincteclette en de 9de Linielaan, in het centrum van Brussel. Twee personen zijn daarbij overleden. Een derde, een taxichauffeur zou buiten levensgevaar zijn. De federale noodfase is afgekondigd deze avond om 21.13. Deze federale fase impliceert de mobilisatie van het nationaal crisiscentrum en van de nationale crisiscellen. Op dat moment is het dossier gefederaliseerd. De overname door het federaal parket kwam er omwille van het mogelijke terroristisch motief van de schietpartij. In de loop van de avond is er een opeising geweest op sociale media. Die boodschap was opgenomen door een persoon die zich identificeert als de aanslagpleger. Hij zegt zich te inspireren op de Islamitische Staat. Tijdens dezelfde boodschap werd de Zweedse nationaliteit van de slachtoffers aangehaald als mogelijk motief voor de daad. Op dit moment is er geen enkele aanwijzing dat de aanslag gelinkt zou zijn aan het Isra√´lisch-Palestijns conflict. Op basis van deze feiten en van de opeising zijn dringende veiligheidsmaatregelen genomen om de Zweedse supporters zo goed mogelijk te beschermen.

facebook,"Many in the mainstream media are already painting the narrative that any retaliation from Israel will be unwarranted and calls for ‚Äòpeace‚Äô will be on Israel‚Äôs shoulders. And if you don‚Äôt know the history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, you‚Äôre likely to believe that narrative. But history and context are important to understand. Calls for peace have been attempted for multiple times over the past few decades. Israel has made MULTIPLE concessions in an attempt to bring this conflict to an end. Every single time, however, those deals have been rejected by the Palestinian government. Why? Because there is no deal that can be made that Palestine or any other terroristic anti-Semitic group will agree with, other than the absolute destruction of the Jewish people. Israel has offered a two-state solution. It was turned down.

He extended the ACDP‚Äôs deepest condolences on the approximately 1300 Israeli lives lost in the last week and strongly condemned last Saturday‚Äôs savage and unprovoked murders of Israeli civilians, and the taking of hostages ‚Äì which initiated the current conflict. Rev Meshoe, he pointed out, was one of the first political leaders to condemn the actions of Hamas. As one of the staunchest supporters of Israel globally, Meshoe has led a political party that has showed unconditional and unwavering support to the nation of God‚Äôs Chosen People over the years. Jewish leaders, community members and VIP guests alike all welcomed the ACDP delegates to the rally, which was organised by the South African Zionist Federation. Speakers included Rabbi Warren Goldstein, the Israeli ambassador, the SAZF National Chairman and President, Inkosi Phakama Shembe, the leaders of COPE and the Patriotic Alliance, and a DA ward councillor. Media personality Gareth Cliff was the Programme Director for the day. ACDP MPs, said Cllr Mkhonza, have even declared ""Am Yisrael Chai"" in Parliament, which means ‚ÄúLet Israel live!‚Äù.

facebook,"GOVERNOR INUWA YAHAYA VISITS NSCDC BOSS, HARPS ON COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES TO COMBAT CRIMES As part of strategies to control farmers/ herders clashes and improved security in schools as well as ensure general security of lives and property in Gombe State, the State Governor, Alhaji Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, CON, has demanded for the deployment of more personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to the state, specifically those in Agro Rangers Unit and general duty operatives to assist in the control of farmers/clashes among other forms of insecurity bedeviling the state. Governor Inuwa stated this while addressing the NSCDC Commandant General, Dr Ahmed Abubakar Audi, mni ofr, and other top members of the management team at the Corps' National Headquarters in Abuja. According to him, Gombe shares boarder with five states most of whom have suffered crises, thus, making his state to become relatively populated with incidences of clashes between farmers and herders especially when there is massive migration by the latter. The Governor expressed hope that the presence of Agro Rangers personnel who are specifically trained to attend to such complex issues of farmers and herders conflict will save the state from such menace towards the end of October as the rains cease. In his words, the demand for additional deployment of Agro Rangers personnel before October ends is to avert incidences of clashes as movement of cattle rearers usually commence at that period and the personnel will be of immense benefits to control clashes and mediate conflict if any. Further on the deployment, he expressed optimism that if security of lives and property was achieved, it will result in food security. The Governor decried high rate of out of school children especially girl child which he attributed to closure of almost all boarding schools for girls in the state except one, and further solicited the assistance of the Corps to reverse the situation by ensuring safe and secured environment for learning, describing the NSCDC as a serious stakeholder in security. He also promised as Chairman of Northern Governors' Forum to create opportunity for the Commandant General to address them on security issues whenever the Governors will convene a meeting. Responding, the CG assured Governor Inuwa of his agency's cooperation and collaboration, stating that his request will be attended on the completion of the ongoing quarterly training of Agro Rangers personnel. He explained that Agro Rangers Unit has resolved more than 1000 cases nationwide, adding that as a special unit, Agro Rangers provide security for farmers and agro allied investments. On the protection of schools, Dr Audi explained that as a lead agency in the protection of critical national assets and Infrastructure his administration will respond to the protection of schools in Gombe State under the safe Schools Project whose Headquarters is housed by the Corps. NSCDC promotes and adopt non-kinetic strategy which generates more results, the Commandant General added.

facebook,"I AM NOT A VET! This on my bio so that I‚Äôm not misrepresenting myself, that was not ever my intention. I hate giving air time to negativity but I am now forced to address the issue after a vet made some very unprofessional comments with 50 percent of the information that was readily available. I also had a complaint made recently to MPI via the veterinary association at the behest of a canterbury vet I‚Äôm aware of. I regularly recommend veterinary treatment/assessment to clients who ask me to see their horses. I recently saw a horse in Invercargill, the owner was distraught with worry and I said this horse presents with indications(palpation and intermittent right side hind lameness)of ulcers‚Ä¶..days later the horse was scoped and had serious ulcers. This is not a competition. The things I talk about on my page is encouraging people to seek vet help. I appreciate my vets and I show mine gratitude when ever I can! They have contributed to saving the lives of my horses many times. I I also appreciate their limitations and that they don‚Äôt have crystal balls. When I started doing this work 4 years ago I never thought this page would grow the way it has. Perhaps I haven‚Äôt been proactive enough about what my qualifications are, they are not formal and I am always learning. That being said, I will not minimise how much of my life I have invested into horses and being a good alround horse person, I talk the talk and I walk the walk. I can cold shoe a horse, I trim my own, I can start horses, I have rehabbed many horses, I read allot of equine books, I have had several equine businesses, I ride to a high standard and I bred damn nice horses. I live in a tiny home my partner and I built to afford the horses I own and to lead a sustainable lifestyle in keeping with the planet , many sacrifices have been made along the way. I am a mother to three wonderful boys (14 year old twin boys and a 9 year old) I have built everything I have from nothing and with a smile on my face. I know resilience. I am now just over my 40th dissection, some of the things I‚Äôve seen I could have never imagined or had seen any public information about. Some days, I wish I didn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶.gignorance is bliss! But I think dissection works is the pinnacle of understanding how horses function and how our intervention can be so damaging. I was accused today by a vet that I think I‚Äôm a guru, I do not and anyone who knows me personally knows I am very aware of my limitations. But I have worked with ALLOT of dysfunctional horses and now looked inside 40, that is not to be diminished. It is slave labour for little return. Learning is a journey. All I am trying to do is help people see anatomy as interesting and relatable to their own horses. If I state something as pathology in a horse it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve had a vet look over the information. I stepped away from the successful charity I started 5 years ago retraining horses because of politics, it appears it‚Äôs been out of the pot and into the fire. Being a part of an animal welfare charity means I have made good connections with the right authorities and have a very good grasp on animal welfare. I know the rules, I abide by them. So much has happened in the background I have shouldered and kept my head up but today was too much. In New Zealand we have a real problem with tall poppy syndrome and it‚Äôs bullshit! The worst thing is seeing women cut women down! Children/families are dying in conflict at the moment, get some perspective!",,1097,"{'like_count': 288, 'comment_count': 349, 'num_users': 23934}",Becks Nairn,,2023-10-16 07:06:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/217563771_776608463001923_2957349448842706424_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Cuo6lnN7yFsAX99upYv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC87YGSyUDI92Onze_Qp8DfunXh4lT-D7OOVGV51nGcrg&oe=655A0E1A,https://www.facebook.com/100063486552387/posts/829899592469585,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393224606_829899452469599_3838378712670610142_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IgCdMeRgqREAX_4skXR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDUF86C8XoeczGO8gPVdzJ0wMEyXaTeVKn9CbtjKOt0Jw&oe=65353C94

facebook,"Romans 16:20 ""The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."" //Paul has been warning the Christians in Rome against false teachers who will come among them and offer a distorted view of Christian truth. He wants the believers to take this warning seriously. He has written that these false teachers do not serve Christ but their own appetites. They are liars looking to deceive naive or innocent Christians. Now, in offering a hopeful truth, Paul seems to associate these false teachers with the father of lies, Satan himself (Galatians 1:8‚Äì9). Paul's final word on the subject seems to be that the God of peace will soon crush Satan under their feet. In other words, the work of Satan among them will ultimately fail and God will prevail through His people. This, then, is another reason to be wary of and resist the false teachers. Because they are associated with Satan in deception about the character of God and the gospel, they will ultimately be crushed. Those who follow them will be crushed, as well. Those who remain true to the God of peace, through faith in Christ, will stand forever.// „Äã„ÄãPeace in the Word of God is not the absence of conflict. Spiritual prosperity overcomes evil. That prosperity comes from the finished work of Christ, from what the God of peace does.„Ää„Ää üôè üôè Dear Lord and Heavenly Father, keep me from Satan's evil activities that are designed to shipwreck the faith in Your people, and keep me ever under Your sovereign authority, influence, and peace.

facebook,"The very serious conflict in Israel and Gaza, has also spilled out into the streets of the West as an ideological battle for support, with many communities asking for fellow citizens to take sides as a show of solidarity. In my opinion, as Australians, our loyalty should always be to our country first. We should not betray the benefits of the peace we enjoy as Australians to forgo our values and national interest to side with views and ideas that are not welcomed in our country. Although it can be complex living in a diverse, multi cultural/faith nation during times of conflict, we already have a set of moral and ethical principles to guide us when navigating such challenges. Even though our country may at times fall short of its aspirations, there is no denying that many people who have sought refuge from war and atrocity find themselves living in countries like Australia.

facebook,"SAYING GOODBYE TO CHRISSY üò• SUZANNE SOMERS, the actress and fitness entrepreneur best known for her comedic role as Chrissy Snow on the 1970s sitcom Three's Company, has died at the age of 76. Somers passed away peacefully at her home in Palm Springs, California on October 15, her publicist confirmed. She had been battling breast cancer for over two decades, having been first diagnosed in her 50s after previously overcoming skin cancer in her 30s. ""She survived an aggressive form of breast cancer for over 23 years,"" said publicist R Couri Hay. ""Her family was gathered to celebrate her 77th birthday on October 16. Instead, they will celebrate her extraordinary life."" Somers skyrocketed to fame as bubbly blonde Chrissy on Three's Company, appearing in over 100 episodes from 1977 to 1981 alongside co-stars John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt. With her portrayal of the stereotypical ""dumb blonde,"" she became one of the most recognizable faces on 1970s television. However, Somers was fired from the show after demanding a substantial pay raise. ""I was making $30,000 an episode, and I just wanted them to pay me what all the guys were making on TV,"" she told ET in 2021 of the conflict. ""But the show said no, so I went on strike."" Prior to Three's Company, Somers had a memorable if brief role in the 1973 film American Graffiti. She later starred as Carol Foster Lambert on the 1990s sitcom Step by Step. Additional TV credits included hosting Candid Camera and her own talk show. Somers also competed on Dancing with the Stars in 2015. Off screen, the actress built a successful business empire around health and beauty products. She promoted the ThighMaster exercise device in ubiquitous infomercials and launched her own line of supplements, skin care items, and hormone replacement therapies. Somers also authored several self-help and diet books. Despite criticism from some in the medical community for advocating alternative cancer treatments, Somers said she controlled her illness through natural methods. ""I'm very selective about my conventional medicine,"" she declared. In July 2022, Somers revealed via Instagram that her breast cancer had returned after a long remission. ""I'm a fighter and I'll continue to fight it with every tool God has given me,"" she wrote at the time. ""It's only one tiny aspect of my life."" Alan Hamel, Somers' husband of 46 years, said she passed peacefully at home surrounded by family. A small private burial will be held, followed by a memorial service in November. Fans and colleagues praised Somers' sunny persona and resilience. Co-star Joyce DeWitt called her ""a gift of life to everyone who knew her."" Marie Osmond said she left ""a legacy of love."" Somers is fondly remembered for her vivacious, comedic talent and trailblazing business success. But her courage battling cancer, willingness to speak openly of her diagnosis, and commitment to aging with vitality may form the most inspiring part of her legacy. She once said, ""Aging is much more about what you have inside than your wrinkles.""",,986,"{'like_count': 432, 'comment_count': 85, 'num_users': 3846513}",Colouring The Past,,2023-10-16 13:00:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292771623_407258314764009_5015733817128884946_n.jpg?stp=c10.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=BuNGew2c0vQAX9KEG0b&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA-kAFMRByufHoRu3Q0qgTDwCcWlbQlEdxPpQl851FDfg&oe=655B8AD6,https://www.facebook.com/100064395325445/posts/709744487848722,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/7880368057711003204?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages2.minutemediacdn.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fc_fill%2Cw_1440%2Car_16%3A9%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto%2Cg_auto%2Fshape%2Fcover%2Fsport%2Fthreescohed-445f015bd764f78c7bc42ff3ba7321bb.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=minutemediacdn.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbE_iv2pd9uWCw1EAxcuXAYbm4hTWndCm4DKo5cesczOCA&oe=6538BB5F

facebook,"The next ECO hunter to tag out was Phillip Foor from Everett Pa in zone9. We talked with Phil on Saturday evening of the drawing and he booked in immediately‚Ä¶but there was a rub. The week before his elk hunt here Phil was going to be moose hunting in New Foundland and his scheduled return home was going to conflict with the start of his elk hunt. Phil wasn‚Äôt to be back home here in PA until Monday morning some time so he was going to miss at least the first two days barring any type of travel delays. Unfortunately Phil wasn‚Äôt able to bring home a moose so he was really hoping to fill his elk tag here. It was Monday late afternoon when Phil and his daughter Riley arrived in camp. He was pretty tired from traveling so Phil, Riley and their guide Kolton George decided to just go for a ride into the zone that evening and hopefully see some elk and give Phil a lay of the land. Kolton had been chomping at the bit for last few days as he had several shooter bulls located on a few of the private properties we have permission on in the zone. As it turned out when they pulled in to one of the properties they saw a shooter bull with cows out in the field‚Ä¶Phil kind of wished he had his gear along at that point. Tuesday dawned with good bugling but heavy fog. They caught a few glimpses of elk throughout the morning but there were no shot opportunities throughout the day and the sunset on the crew that evening pretty quietly. Wednesday morning right off the bat Kolton had Phil In position for a shot at a good bull. At 30 yards Phil drew his bow and took aim. The shot sailed low and forward and Kolton believed it to be a grazing hit across the brisket/leg area. The bull ran off out of the field into the woods and they decided to give him several hours before taking up the trail. They found minimal blood and had to resort to grid searching at which point they actually saw the bull again but weren‚Äôt able to get a shot so they opted to back out. That evening they saw the same bull bugling and chasing cows as if nothing was wrong confirming Koltons thought that it was a grazing superficial hit. The next morning they were back in the same area as the day before trying to locate the bull from the day before but it was a pretty quiet morning. Midday on Thursday Phil got word from back home about an equipment issue at work and he needed to head back to take of it. The hope was for Phil to be able to get it straightened out and then be back up to hunt asap. Friday afternoon Phil was back in camp and along for the adventure now was his son Briar and he was ready to hunt. The trio went for a hike up on the sidehill of the property they had been hunting and it didn‚Äôt take long for them to find elk‚Ä¶one of which being a shooter bull, different than the one from earlier in the week. They were able to sneak within 40yds of the bull but the brush didn‚Äôt allow for a shot and eventually the elk got antsy and moved off ending the day. Saturday morning was pretty slow compared to the days prior so Phil opted to return home again to take care of some more work obligations, but he planned to be back at camp Tuesday afternoon with Briar to finish out the week hunting. Kolton kept an eye out in the zone while Phil was away and began tightening down the game plan. Tuesday afternoon as soon as Briar got off the school bus he hopped in the truck with his dad and headed up to elk camp. When they arrived we talked them into a quick evening hunt and headed to the zone. Kolton had seen a shooter bull earlier in the day, the same one from Friday, and was waiting for Phil and Briar to arrive. This trip Phil had decided to bring his crossbow. They didn‚Äôt have much time left in the day but Koltons plan was to slip down an access road to a food plot that was surrounded by tall grass and use that grass for cover as they approached. They were almost down to the spot where Kolton wanted to slip in to the plot when the bull bugled. Phil and Briar thought the bull sounded like he was in the river but Kolton knew he was in the plot but facing away from them rather causing the bugle so sound further away than what it was. They crept along a lil further to an opening in the grass where they could see in to the field and there he was! It was almost reactionary as Phil shouldered his crossbow and took aim. At 20yards the bolt hit the bull in the boiler room and he charged off across the field. Phil quickly re-cocked and loaded the crossbow and Kolton moved them towards the bull. Phil was able to fire a second bolt in the sweet spot and at hit the bull lunged forward and plowed to the ground and was down‚Ä¶Briars eyes were as big as dinner plates! Congratulations again Phil and thanks for choosing ECO! Also it was great having you and the youngsters in camp and out in the field. It‚Äôs great to see the youth involved and excited about hunting!",,859,"{'like_count': 675, 'comment_count': 108, 'num_users': 26554}",Elk County Outfitters,,2023-10-16 12:00:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/327322605_3040903756055800_3416115569680979851_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hFVoMnLXBwYAX8RBUgL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCFqkCEu2VlVuG3ID7LULu-fvaQUTA_VwSmDEF06KUBQA&oe=655B111C,https://www.facebook.com/100064707994771/posts/720939246739669,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391744964_720927170074210_8013400884302089377_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LqyS6jdcqZgAX_R0moE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAfIdOwszuxFl1iszMP3fldu1xbj8iPIofefbJVgc5h-A&oe=65321776

facebook,"üéôÔ∏èCNN LIVE interview on the source of where this conflict is coming from, the experiences we went through on the front lines of combat, and what will happen moving forward. War is what happens when humans fail in finding solutions to problems that always have answers. It often stems from externalizing real and deep rooted emotions, which often cause our outlook to be so clouded that it produces hatred, dehumanization of the other, and zero sum game narratives. Today we are at war, and we have arrived to the consequence of the years of this type of divisive thinking. At some point this war will end, and although we would have all lost lives on both sides, we must honor the lives of those still breathing by making sure we do not repeat this again. A resolution of justice that fulfills the real cultural aspirations of both populations is the only solution. It can only be achieved together, so drop the past and invest everything in the future.

The two-day Sikkim Youth Convention 2023 organised by Voice NGO and supported by the State Government, with the motto ‚ÄòRevolutionizing Young Minds‚Äô, is being initiated to motivate the Sikkimese youth. Over 900 students from all government and private colleges in Sikkim were invited to attend the Sikkim Youth Convention 2023. Present among others were Ministers Shri K.N. Lepcha, Shri L.N. Sharma, MP Lok Sabha Shri Indra Hang Subba, MLAs Shri Aditya Golay, Shri Sonam Tshering Venchungpa, Shri Y.T. Lepcha and Smt. Farwanti Tamang, Chief Economic Advisor, Dr. Mahendra P. Lama, Political Secretary to CM, Press Secretary to CM, Deputy Mayor GMC, ADGP Law & Order (Sikkim Police), State Government officials, dignitaries, eminent motivational speakers and educationists. The Convention began with the Saraswati Vandana performed by the students of Reeyaz Sangeetalaya followed by offering of Khadas and lighting of the ceremonial lamp by the Chief Guest and other dignitaries. Keynote Speaker, Founder & Director of the Drishti IAS Coaching, Former IAS Officer Dr. Vikas Divyakirti began his address by offering condolences to the bereaved family of the flash flood induced disaster in the State. He shared one of his primary reasons to accept the invitation for the Convention was realising that Sikkim emerges at the top spot with the best workplace conditions for women in the country. He underlined the fundamental parameters of a developed society being categorised under two sub-categories; a) women‚Äôs participation in the State work force and b) society safeguarding the minorities. The Speaker compared his journey to that of the Chief Minister Shri Prem Singh Tamang from clearing the UPSC Civil Services Examination to return to the teaching profession, and expressed that Sikkim is being led by a teacher and that itself is exemplary. Taking one of Dr. Vikas Divyakirti‚Äôs notable contributions, ‚ÄòTriple 8‚Äô formula‚Äîa strategic blueprint he proposes for IAS aspirants, he encouraged the candidates to allocate their day into three vital segments: 8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of focused study, and a crucial 8 hours dedicated to recreation and societal interaction. He discouraged becoming a study robot, engrossed solely in academic materials for countless hours. Instead, he encouraged a holistic approach, where candidates engage with their surroundings, fostering a well-rounded understanding that complements academic prowess. Dr. Divyakirti emphasised that mastering the UPSC examination involves more than mere bookish knowledge. Understanding society, its dynamics, and its challenges is integral to the selection process. This is why he advocates for a balanced approach that not only entails rigorous study but also allows candidates to engage with society, meet friends, and enjoy recreational activities. He also took few questions before closing his interaction for the Convention. Speaker, Senior Professor, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi also Former Member, National Security Advisory Board, Government of India and Sikkim's Chief Economic Advisor, Dr. Mahendra P. Lama in his address, pointed out the fact that there are only a handful of IAS and IPS officers and their numbers should increase. Emphasising on soft powers like Education, the Academician stressed that at Sikkim University, they undertook some of the programmes and researches in the various schools like Global Studies, Peace and Conflict, Sustainable Development, Biotechnology, Climate Change and also Law and Governance. As people play the most important role in shaping the status of the country, education is responsible for shaping a person, he added. He encouraged the students about the importance of Cultivation of education, as it plays a crucial role in technological developments and imparts various skills, values, and awareness. The other distinguished speakers invited for the Convention were Professor, Department of Education, Sikkim University Dr. Yodita Bhutia, who is the first Ph.D and UGC NET holder in Education from Sikkim and Dr. Ashis Sharma, Vice Chancellor, Khangchendzonga State University.

facebook,"Last week I posted here reflecting on why the atrocities committed by Hammas on innocent Israeli men, women and children were similar to 9/11, arguing that the terrorists were seeking to provoke Israel into anger as a means of scuppering the relationships that Netanyahu had been building between Isreal and Sunni Arab nations in the region. Today I want to talk about the ways that the Black Saturday attack was not like 9/11. In September 2001, America was targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists as a proxy for western imperialism. The evidence is found in the ‚ÄòLetter to America‚Äô that Osama Bin Laden posted after the event to justify ordering such a horrific attack. That he included ‚Äòenvironmental destruction‚Äô in the list reasons why America deserved to be attacked was a sign that he was desperate to convince people that he was right to order such an atrocity. Hammas felt no need to offer an explanation for why they attacked Israel, and it was not because no words could justify the terrible acts of violence that they committed that day. Israel is not a proxy target to Hammas. It is a state which has been in conflict with the Palestinian people for the past 70 years. Sometimes that war has been one of low level attrition, sometimes it has been all-out combat. The fact that Israel has been forced to become a highly militarised society is a product of this reality. I stress again that this does not mean that the Hammas attacks were justified. Directly targeting civilians, in terror or war, cannot be justified. The point that I am seeking to make is that, horrific though it may be, Black Saturday didn‚Äôt just appear out of a blue sky like the planes that hit the Twin Towers. The world has watched this uneven conflict play out on our tv screens over the past decades. We have witnessed the cycle of terrorism and retribution over and over again. We know what is coming next. The humanity that causes us to weep for the victims of Black Saturday also makes us fear for the people of Gaza. Tonight the London Evening Standard ran a front page story complaining that the level of vocal support for Israel was shamefully sparse given the terrible atrocities that were committed by Hammas. It referenced the disturbing rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes in the past week, rightly condemning them as unacceptable. ‚ÄúAnd yet worse than all this‚Äù the article continued ‚Äúis the sound of silence. Nobody cares it seems.‚Äù I don‚Äôt believe that last statement is true. People do care. They sympathise with those who grieve for the loss of so many in the terror visited on innocent civilians by Hammas on Black Saturday. But they are also aware of the tanks massed on the Gazan border and the air strikes that demolish the homes of Palestinian families. Their silence should not be taken as tacit support for Hammas, nor as a sign of anti-Semitism. People are silent because they are holding their breath in trepidation of what will happen when the most powerful military nation in the Middle East invades one of the most densely populated areas on Earth. If they do not voice support for Israel, it is from fear of being complicit in the killing of innocent civilians.",,753,"{'like_count': 549, 'comment_count': 144, 'num_users': 347498}",Billy Bragg,,2023-10-16 22:21:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/333814339_6052191811540595_8018747804954056124_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8RLbyZHMdgAAX9WfAx5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfABg7ErWyhYZFX7oV_2qcunCc5pezZD51lKU7OPy8hZIg&oe=655B8A72,https://www.facebook.com/100044350033272/posts/867504128071247,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/2951586824473257423?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.standard.co.uk%2F2023%2F10%2F16%2F10%2FnewFile-4.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1200%26width%3D1200%26auto%3Dwebp%26quality%3D75&fb_obo=1&utld=standard.co.uk&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbEJwrOUBzldowqJWTKUhpC0aIbK_nb-nzaGZ9GAEzSUVA&oe=6556F26F

I was wealthy before I was appointed by President Jonathan. I was investigated down to my underwear by the Buhari administration and found clean. I visited Nigeria twice under Buhari. I was in Nigeria three months ago. I have never been detained at Heathrow Airport or any airport in any country in the world. My name is not in Pandora Papers as a criminal who illegally stashed money in tax havens. I did not commit the misdemeanour of conflict of interest by putting state government funds in a bank where I have significant shares. So, exactly why should I be in prison? Kachi, this is the type of Nigeria you want. A Nigeria where anyone who does not support your Presidential candidate and has views that differ with your movement is thrown in prison. If you and those you represent ever get power, I shudder to think of what Nigeria will become. Critics will either disappear or be in jail.

facebook,"From 1517 to 1917, what is today Israel, along with much of the Middle East, was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. But World War I dramatically altered the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. In 1917, at the height of the war, British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour submitted a letter of intent supporting the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The British government hoped that the formal declaration‚Äîknown thereafter as the Balfour Declaration‚Äîwould encourage support for the Allies in World War I. When World War I ended in 1918 with an Allied victory, the 400-year Ottoman Empire rule ended, and Great Britain took control over what became known as Palestine (modern-day Israel, Palestine and Jordan). The Balfour Declaration and the British mandate over Palestine were approved by the League of Nations in 1922. Arabs vehemently opposed the Balfour Declaration, concerned that a Jewish homeland would mean the subjugation of Arab Palestinians. The British controlled Palestine until Israel, in the years following the end of World War II, became an independent state in 1947. Conflict Between Jews and Arabs Throughout Israel‚Äôs long history, tensions between Jews and Arab Muslims have existed. The complex hostility between the two groups dates all the way back to ancient times when they both populated the area and deemed it holy. Both Jews and Muslims consider the city of Jerusalem sacred. It contains the Temple Mount, which includes the holy sites al-Aqsa Mosque, the Western Wall, the Dome of the Rock and more. Much of the conflict in recent years has centered around who is occupying the following areas: Gaza Strip: A piece of land located between Egypt and modern-day Israel. Golan Heights: A rocky plateau between Syria and modern-day Israel. West Bank: A territory that divides part of modern-day Israel and Jordan. The Zionism Movement In the late 19th and early 20th century, an organized religious and political movement known as Zionism emerged among Jews. Zionists wanted to reestablish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Massive numbers of Jews immigrated to the ancient holy land and built settlements. Between 1882 and 1903, about 35,000 Jews relocated to Palestine. Another 40,000 settled in the area between 1904 and 1914. Many Jews living in Europe and elsewhere, fearing persecution during the Nazi reign, found refuge in Palestine and embraced Zionism. After the Holocaust and World War II ended, members of the Zionist movement primarily focused on creating an independent Jewish state. Arabs in Palestine resisted the Zionism movement, and tensions between the two groups continue. An Arab nationalist movement developed as a result. Israeli Independence The United Nations approved a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and Arab state in 1947, but the Arabs rejected it. In May 1948, Israel was officially declared an independent state with David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, as the prime minister. While this historic event seemed to be a victory for Jews, it also marked the beginning of more violence with the Arabs. 1948 Arab-Israeli War Following the announcement of an independent Israel, five Arab nations‚ÄîEgypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon‚Äîimmediately invaded the region in what became known as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Civil war broke out throughout all of Israel, but a cease-fire agreement was reached in 1949. As part of the temporary armistice agreement, the West Bank became part of Jordan, and the Gaza Strip became Egyptian territory. How the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Began Numerous wars and acts of violence between Arabs and Jews have ensued since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Some of these include: Suez Crisis: Relations between Israel and Egypt were rocky in the years following the 1948 war. In 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser overtook and nationalized the Suez Canal, the important shipping waterway that connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. With the help of British and French forces, Israel attacked the Sinai Peninsula and retook the Suez Canal. Six-Day War: In what started as a surprise attack, Israel in 1967 defeated Egypt, Jordan and Syria in six days. After this brief war, Israel took control of the Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank, and Golan Heights. These areas were considered ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù by Israel. Yom Kippur War: Hoping to catch the Israeli army off guard, in 1973 Egypt and Syria launched air strikes against Israel on the Holy Day of Yom Kippur. The fighting went on for two weeks, until the UN adopted a resolution to stop the war. Syria hoped to recapture the Golan Heights during this battle but was unsuccessful. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights, but Syria continued to claim it as territory. Lebanon War: In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon and ejected the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). This group, which started in 1964 and declared all Arab citizens living in Palestine up to 1947 to be called (truncated)",,636,"{'like_count': 196, 'comment_count': 105, 'num_users': 18461}",Restoring Sanity Group,,2023-10-16 13:10:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/276068362_3927569940801340_8037617003515610949_n.png?stp=c41.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YhdVUkv8EY8AX9aNTYo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBB3hwtHO2-a9chHxb6nprKQXg9y8dcYTFzjESNT6yRwA&oe=655A5D66,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1356097811163709/permalink/6632159840224120,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391591730_6919950051402651_18886936747791948_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=-89C6NjjEUoAX8RKONx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAXpaiuxB9wLAc-UsMFTBU5smxyeZ_jNeW0GnLX7rjadQ&oe=653D148C

Twee personen zijn daarbij overleden. 
Een derde, een taxichauffeur zou buiten levensgevaar zijn. 
 
De federale noodfase is afgekondigd deze avond om 21.13. 
 
Deze federale fase impliceert de mobilisatie van het nationaal crisiscentrum en van de nationale crisiscellen. 
 
Op dat moment is het dossier gefederaliseerd. 
De overname door het federaal parket kwam er omwille van het mogelijke terroristisch motief van de schietpartij. 
 
In de loop van de avond is er een opeising geweest op sociale media. Die boodschap was opgenomen door een persoon die zich identificeert als de aanslagpleger. 
Hij zegt zich te inspireren op de Islamitische Staat. 
 
Tijdens dezelfde boodschap werd de Zweedse nationaliteit van de slachtoffers aangehaald als mogelijk motief voor de daad. 
 
Op dit moment is er geen enkele aanwijzing dat de aanslag gelinkt zou zijn aan het Isra√´lisch-Palestijns conflict. 
 
Op basis van deze feiten en van de opeising zijn dringende veiligheidsmaatregelen genomen om de Zweedse supporters zo goed mogelijk te beschermen.

facebook,"2023 is officially in the books for MBR and it ended in a way that we never would have predicted. Since we purchased our car in 2015, our focus has been steadfast on running it in-house and racing it as a family team. In our first 8 years of ownership we have never had the desire to make our seat available for another driver at an event because we purchased the car for the sole purpose of wanting to race it ourselves. About a month ago we received an unexpected call from Antron Brown asking for a favor. He was in the midst of sorting through the logistics of getting a multi-race schedule finalized for Angelle Sampey‚Äôs Top Alcohol Dragster debut and they had one last hole in their schedule that needed to be filled because the car that she would be driving the rest of the year would not be available in Dallas due to a conflict with that event being the 2023 JEGS All Star race. To be fair, not only was that car not available, but none of the other proverbial front-running A/fuel cars in the class were available in Dallas due to the same reason. So Antron took a chance. Our team‚Äôs primary focuses have always been to have an immaculately-prepared racecar that is ready to run as soon as it arrives at the racetrack, to have a clean and professionally presented operation both on and off the track, and to provide a place where family, friends, and other racers can gather during the weekend that is a welcoming environment. Yes, we are constantly focused on finding ways to run quicker and faster, but on-track performance is a chase that will never stop and there will be variables at times that are out of our control. The other focuses listed above, however, are things that we can control and they are things that we are committed to every single time we leave the shop. This opportunity happened because Antron, his whole AB Motorsports Team, and Angelle all have the same values and vision as we do when it comes to what success looks like in the sport of drag racing. Antron and Angelle have each held the title of World Champion multiple times at the highest level of the sport and they know what it takes to win every single day. They showed up ready to make this event a success no matter what it took and they immersed themselves in both the team and our family from the moment we said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do this.‚Äù For as long as this post is, it‚Äôs somehow only an anecdote that Angelle took out the #1 qualifier in round 1 and then eliminated national championship contender Tony Stewart in the second round of eliminations to record a semi-final finish in her first ever Top Alcohol Dragster race. She absolutely killed it while driving. We are northbound for the next day and a half heading back to Ohio and we‚Äôll be thinking about this weekend for a long time. 2024 will bring a new car and a new look for MBR, but the goals and values will remain the same. Antron, thank you for believing in us to give us a shot to launch your new AB Accelerate Program. It was an absolute honor. Angelle, thank you for your trust in our team and your care with our equipment. But more importantly, thank you for your incredible words in the video above. It is validation at the highest level that we are on the right path as we chase our dream. You both are part of the MBR family for life. #GOMBR",,612,"{'like_count': 389, 'comment_count': 53, 'num_users': 8886}",Michalek Brothers Racing,,2023-10-16 14:22:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/159475225_111976684254038_5460132558516143711_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=O-NrvxCjyVUAX-jnVmR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA0KNGaj-JKeN_9xRkcnzcq0gN2JboVPHI48KL_MDgT-w&oe=657D1DC2,https://www.facebook.com/100063251198267/posts/643663707751997,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393313914_321935607087742_6489945668206487107_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=tVlBWNRiPmoAX9w2Tmq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBlssMcGUgn6rcwc7Y7pgERnwyP9m8GiUpn-2OzGmB9wg&oe=6539D12E

May the Gentleness of Christ prevail through the pain of conflict and mistrust, May the Presence of Christ heal the wounds that are inflicted, May the Hope and Courage of Christ be with all who are desperate and dying, May the Truth of Christ enlighten those in positions of authority to seek new ways of living that foster harmony and mutual respect, and May the Peace of Christ dwell deep within the hearts of all in this the Land of the Holy One. We ask this and all our prayers through the same, Jesus Christ our Lord, and through the intercession of our Heavenly Mother Mary.

""Dialogue, Not Warfare, is the Path to Enduring Peace,"" asserts Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa in a conversation with Palestinian Ambassador to Sri Lanka, H.E. Dr. Zuhair Hamdallah. Mr. Sajith Premadasa emphasizes that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine should be addressed through diplomatic negotiations to safeguard the well-being of citizens in both nations. He advocates for a lasting peace over temporary solutions, urging both countries to find a mutually agreeable resolution.

This time your approach is different than before. You took some time to inner reflect on things internally. You are always wanting better for yourself and the people around you. You needed this alone time to sit back seeing things from a different perspective. You tend to crave solitude but when people respect your space/boundaries you look at it like neglect. Your isolation came from differences of opinions tha led to conflict. You can be emotional and closed off but I see you are working on being more direct in a calmly way stating your feelings/thoughts so a resolution can be made. I love this! Keep working on you so that any and everything you desire you are mentally ready for it. You are a big thinker so it‚Äôs no surprise that your over thinking creates scenarios in your head making you believe what you created. You have to decipher intuition vs insecurities. Big things are coming the progress is already in process you see it this is what motivate you to keep going. You are building a legacy and the end of 2023 you will see what you really have accomplished. Keep track of all of your milestones.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who returned to Israel Monday after visits to several other countries in the region, said the United States was working with Egypt, Israel and the U.N. to ensure aid can enter Gaza and reach those in need. ""Over the past few days, I‚Äôve traveled to Israel, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt,"" Blinken said Monday on X. ""What I‚Äôve heard from every partner is a shared view to prevent the conflict from spreading, to safeguard innocent lives, and to get assistance to those in Gaza who need it."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs office said in a statement Monday there was no agreement in place for a cease-fire to allow aid into Gaza and for foreigners to exit. The head of the U.N.‚Äôs Palestinian refugee agency said Sunday that Gaza is ""being strangled"" and that soon supplies of water, food and medicine will run out. ""Last week‚Äôs attack on Israel was horrendous,"" he told reporters. ""The attack and the taking of hostages are a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. But the answer to killing civilians cannot be to kill more civilians.""

facebook,"‚ÄúHAMAS is NOT PALESTINE!‚Äù My personal view on the stance taken by my President and Deputy President üíöüíö The conflict between Israel and Palestine has been a longstanding and complex issue that has resulted in immense suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians. It is important to recognize that supporting Israel does not automatically translate into hating Palestinians, and denouncing the atrocities committed by Hamas is not an endorsement of the loss of innocent Palestinian lives. It is crucial to separate the actions of a terrorist group like Hamas from the aspirations of peace that both Israel and Palestine seek. Hamas, classified as a terrorist organization by numerous countries, has consistently been responsible for attacks on Israeli civilians, causing death and destruction. However, it is equally important to acknowledge that innocent Palestinians also suffer as a result of the actions taken by Hamas. The ongoing conflict has cost the lives of countless innocent civilians on both sides, perpetuating a cycle of violence and despair. Supporting Israel and denouncing Hamas should not be seen as mutually exclusive. It is crucial to understand that condemning Hamas does not justify or endorse any form of violence or harm against innocent Palestinians. The ultimate goal should be a peaceful solution that respects the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. My President His Excellency Gayton McKenzie of the Patriotic Alliance has always been an advocate for peace between Israel and Palestine. He recognizes that Hamas is a major obstacle in achieving lasting peace in both Israel and Palestine. By supporting Israel's efforts to address the threat posed by Hamas, My President believes that the door can be opened for meaningful negotiations and ultimately a resolution to the conflict. And as he stated before he shall be a President that bring all parties to the table for peace. For South Africa should be the global peace makerüíöüíö In conclusion, supporting Israel does not equate to hating Palestinians, and denouncing Hamas does not justify the loss of innocent Palestinian lives. Peace can only be achieved when both Israelis and Palestinians can live without fear of violence. Therefore, it is crucial to stand against terrorism and support efforts aimed at bringing an end to the conflict, promoting peace, and ensuring the safety and well-being of all people involved. HAMAS IS NOT PALESTINE! HAMAS MUST BE STOPPED! We pray for peace in the Middle East, so that there is an end to the unnecessary loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives. So help us Godüíöüíöüôèüèæ I hereby publicly declare that I Stand by the geopolitical stance taken by my President His Excellency Gayton McKenzie and My Deputy President the Honorable Kenny Kunene against Hamas!

The Unending Fights - Too much fight is not good for any relationship. ‚Ä¢ You can disagree but it doesn't always have to lead to fight. Conflict is allowed but must not be too much.

facebook,"When James Monroe was elected president in 1816, Washington, D.C., was still reeling with the aftermath of invasion. On August 24, 1814, British forces torched the White House and other federal buildings, casualties of the War of 1812. Yet in the aftermath of the conflict, national pride swelled. President Monroe hoped to embody the unity and economic growth of the ‚ÄúEra of Good Feelings.‚Äù In his vision, the reconstruction of the White House was a part of that unifying effort. Under the supervision of original architect James Hoban and commissioner Samuel Lane, the White House project moved along swiftly with a workforce of 190 free and enslaved laborers. President Monroe pressed for an even faster pace, demanding weekly reports from Colonel Lane and involving himself with the most minor details. The deadline of eight months set by President Monroe inflicted a heavy burden on the workers, but they worked diligently through the summer at his behest. As the White House progressed, the Monroes temporarily stayed in a rowhome at 2017 I Street NW. The Federal style brick house played eyewitness to James Monroe‚Äôs rise to the presidency and played host to his Inaugural reception. The president met with advisors in offices on the east side of the home, and First Lady Elizabeth Kortright Monroe entertained guests there with elegance and an affinity for French style. The I Street residence still stands, home to The Arts Club of Washington since 1918. President Monroe got his wish. The White House was ready in six months. On New Year‚Äôs Day 1818, President Monroe officially opened the mansion to the public for a three-hour reception. The interior reconstruction process continued into January 1820, but with President Monroe in residence, the People‚Äôs House projected American unity and resilience more than ever before.",,463,"{'like_count': 368, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 329869}",The White House Historical Association,,2023-10-16 14:22:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/272132015_157506783296460_3075917926651227005_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=FoYFOT9nW40AX-HXead&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD0cZ9gPCWs_Iu1pOa1b-IFk5C4x2NjPisZMSQnrTAhvw&oe=655B8479,https://www.facebook.com/100071114166488/posts/374180744962395,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391739039_374180624962407_6536077968886058842_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xz22XtYq-DwAX9PTTQ0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCR9a7AcByyrddLAwnYxxnBAZy5k2hKLxP5KSQboj2Niw&oe=653225E5

facebook,"The Scottish physician and biologist John Boyd Orr emerged in the inter-war years as one of Britain's leading experts on nutrition. He maintained that many Britons were malnourished because their incomes were too low. Boyd Orr participated in the efforts in the League of Nations to achieve an international policy on nutrition. During the Second World War, he proposed the idea of a ""world food plan"" to President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the USA. In 1945 he was elected Director-General of the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), the first of the specialised organisations established under the United Nations. Food and prosperity for all people on earth led to peace, Boyd Orr argued. Boyd Orr was an ardent adherent of world organisation as a means of securing peace, and argued for a world government ruling according to rules of international law. The nations of the world were now so dependent on each other that they had to give up some of their sovereignty. Boyd Orr was elevated to the peerage for his national and international commitment. In 1949 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ""for his lifelong effort to conquer hunger and want, thereby helping to remove a major cause of military conflict and war."" #WorldFoodDay",,446,"{'like_count': 281, 'comment_count': 36, 'num_users': 5320050}",Nobel Prize,,2023-10-16 15:56:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/356843912_642002167961616_5873002223479967527_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=gCKARgAhlJcAX-kdjCG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBEczUyWDF3ocV7qhu4YImsEZ1UVKob_MNPAI-x5MhDkA&oe=655B41C9,https://www.facebook.com/100064555159421/posts/703509845144181,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393595868_703509818477517_8556849938862809407_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=B0Qu2EUX7u0AX-0XC4v&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCYeW5qDE-1Ym5UvG_HKuXW7DNGN8s_oS3XUyAXEZKLlg&oe=65532BC7

Malaysia bersedia untuk membantu dari segenap cara dan perkara yang boleh mengurangkan beban rakyat Palestin. Perdana Menteri juga telah maklumkan di dalam dewan bahawa saya juga akan mewakili Malaysia untuk ke Mesyuarat Tergempar OIC di Jeddah pada 18 Oktober ini bagi membincangkan secara lebih lanjut mengenai isu Palestin ini. Ini akan disusuli dengan lawatan kerja Perdana Menteri ke Riyadh untuk Persidangan Asean-GCC pada 19 Oktober dan perjumpaan rasmi dengan Perdana Menteri Arab Saudi nanti. Pada masa sama, Malaysia juga sedang melihat kaedah dan cara tercepat dengan beberapa pihak untuk kita menghantar bantuan segera terutamanya bekalan makanan dan ubatan. Saya juga telah membuat panggilan telefon dengan beberapa rakan sejawatan dari negara lain seperti Indonesia, Brunei, Turkiye, UAE, Arab Saudi, Palestin, Iran, Setiausaha Agung United Nations, dan Pesuruhjaya Tinggi Kesatuan Eropah bagi mengangkat segala kebimbangan dan tindakan bersama yang boleh diambil.

Malaysia is ready to help in all ways that can ease the burden of the Palestinian people. The Prime Minister has also informed Dewan Rakyat that I will represent Malaysia at the OIC Extraordinary Meeting in Jeddah on 18 October to further discuss the Palestinian issue. This will be followed by the Prime Minister's working visit to Riyadh for the ASEAN-GCC Conference on October 19 and an official meeting with the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia later. At the same time, Malaysia is also looking at the mechanism for us to immediately send aid, especially food and medicine supplies. I have also made phone calls with several counterparts such as Indonesia, Brunei, Turkiye, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Iran, the Secretary General of the United Nations, and the High Commissioner of the European Union to raise our concerns and the possible joint actions that can be taken.

facebook,"Yesterday, I had the privilege of addressing a congregation during a thanksgiving service held by the Izere Nation in honor of Prof. Danladi Abok Atu, the immediate past Secretary to Plateau State Government. The event took place at the St. Paul's Catholic Pastoral Area in Lamingo Gwafan, Jos North Local Government. I draw upon my extensive experience in peace building and conflict management to fulfill my current role. My focus is on fostering industrial harmony, a crucial element for President Tinubu's Renewed Hope Agenda. Throughout my journey in public service, I've strived to create an inclusive Plateau State free from discrimination, oppression, and injustice. This foundation has allowed all citizens to be active participants in governance, a cornerstone for trust and confidence in government operations. I firmly believe that building trust and confidence is vital, especially when faced with agitations, grievances, or differences that could otherwise be exploited. President Bola Tinubu's vision is to develop Nigeria by encouraging dedicated public and private sector workers. This was evident in our swift response to a recent labor strike threat, which we successfully averted through dialogue. During the event, I expressed my gratitude to Prof. Danladi Abok Atu for his diligent work in implementing the Rescue Agenda of my administration. I also assured the people of Plateau State that I would continue to advocate for the state's interests within the Federal Government, striving to attract programs and projects through every available means. Catholic Archbishop of Jos, Ishaya Audu, acknowledged Prof. Atu's visionary leadership and his commitment to serving the people. He encouraged me to advocate for critical issues such as infrastructure, education, security, and other entitlements of Plateau State as a member of the Federal Executive Council. In a heartfelt homily, Msgnr Prof. Cletus Gotan emphasized the importance of service to the people as service to God, urging public officeholders to fulfill their mandates with dedication and a deep sense of moral responsibility. The large gathering at the event demonstrated Prof. Atu's successful collaboration with people from all walks of life, who came together to offer their thanks to God. The paramount ruler of the Izere Nation, Adagwom Izere Dr. Isaac Wakili, highlighted Prof. Atu's contributions to the community's development and his unwavering integrity, which brought honor to the Chiefdom. Prof. Danladi Abok Atu, the guest of honor, expressed his gratitude to God for the opportunity to serve the public over the years, including his recent role as the Secretary to Plateau State Government under my administration. He commended me for my commitment to peace, competence, compassion, and integrity. He vowed to maintain the trust placed in him and encouraged former appointees to unite in building a robust political structure for effective service. The event was graced by dignitaries from both within and outside the state, including Mallam Balarabe Abbas Lawal, Minister Designate and former Secretary to Kaduna State Government. Following the event, I hosted some of my former appointees at my residence, including commissioners, Heads of Boards and Parastatals, and members of the House of Assembly.",,418,"{'like_count': 331, 'comment_count': 48, 'num_users': 14459}",Rt.

facebook,"The Nature of the Final Battle, October 16
The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation. Jeremiah 50:25. Mar 297.1
At His own will God summons the forces of nature to overthrow the might of His enemies‚Äî‚Äúfire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word.‚Äù Psalm 148:8. When the heathen Amorites had set themselves to resist His purposes, God interposed, casting down ‚Äúgreat stones from heaven‚Äù upon the enemies of Israel. We are told of a greater battle to take place in the closing scenes of earth‚Äôs history, when Jehovah ‚Äúhath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation.‚Äù Jeremiah 50:25. ‚ÄúHast thou,‚Äù he inquires, ‚Äúentered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?‚Äù Job 38:22, 23. Mar 297.2
The revelator describes the destruction that is to take place when the ‚Äúgreat voice out of the temple of heaven‚Äù announces, ‚ÄúIt is done.‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúThere fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent.‚Äù Revelation 16:17, 21. Mar 297.3
In the last scenes of this earth‚Äôs history, war will rage. Mar 297.4
The powers of evil will not yield up the conflict without a struggle. But Providence has a part to act in the battle of Armageddon. Mar 297.5
The Captain of the Lord‚Äôs host will stand at the head of the angels of heaven to direct the battle. Mar 297.6
He on whose vesture is written the name, King of kings and Lord of lords, leads forth the armies of heaven on white horses, clothed in fine linen, clean and white. Mar 297.7
When He shall come to the earth again, He will shake ‚Äúnot the earth only, but also heaven.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll‚Äù; ‚Äúthe elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.‚Äù But ‚Äúthe Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.‚Äù Hebrews 12:26; Isaiah 24:20; 34:4; 2 Peter 3:10; Joel 3:16.

facebook,"MANDELA'S GRANDSON LEADS PALESTINE SOLIDARITY MARCH Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela, South African member of parliament and Nelson Mandela's grandson, led thousands of South Africans on 13 October in Cape Town to rally support for Palestinians over the most recent Israel-Hamas conflict. He encouraged South Africans to stand in solidarity with Palestinians because they supported Black South Africans in the fight for liberation against apartheid. He also called for the South African government to cancel the flight permits of Israeli national air carrier El-Al. South Africa has close relations with Palestine. It established full diplomatic relations with the State of Palestine on 15 February 1995. Nelson Mandela toured Gaza in 1999 and urged Israel to withdraw from all the areas it occupied after the 1967 war with neighboring Arab states, and in particular to withdraw completely from the Golan Heights, from south Lebanon and from the West Bank.

facebook,"How Do Shaivites Regard Other Faiths? Religious beliefs are manifold and different. Shaivites, understanding the strength of this diversity, wholeheartedly respect and encourage all who believe in God. They honor the fact that Truth is one, paths are many. Since the inner intent of all religions is to bind man back to God, Shaivite Hindus seek not to interfere with anyone‚Äôs faith or practice. We believe that there is no exclusive path, no one way for all. Shaivites profoundly know that God Shiva is the same Supreme Being in whom peoples of all faiths find solace, peace and liberation. Nonetheless, we realize that all religions are not the same. Each has its unique beliefs, practices, goals and paths of attainment, and the doctrines of one often conflict with those of another. Even this should never be cause for religious tension or intolerance. Shaivites respect all religious traditions and the people within them. They know that good citizens and stable societies are created from groups of religious people. Shaivite leaders support and participate in ecumenical gatherings with all religions. Still, Shaivites defend their faith, proceed contentedly with their practices and avoid the enchantment of other ways, be they ancient or modern. The Vedas explain, ‚ÄúLet us have concord with our own people, and concord with people who are strangers to us. Asvins, create between us and the strangers a unity of hearts.‚Äù Aum Namah Shivaya.

As followers of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace who became incarnate in the very lands of this conflict, we pray for an end to this war and the devastating human misery that it brings. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, His Eminence Pierbattista Cardinal Pizzaballa, has called for a day of prayer, fasting and abstinence, to be observed around the world on Tuesday the 17th of October. To this end, all of the Masses offered at St Mary‚Äôs Cathedral tomorrow (Tuesday 17 Oct) will be for this special intention.

facebook,"The Hamas attack on October 7 has killed 1,300 Israelis and foreign nationals. Israel, in turn, has launched hundreds of airstrikes and missile attacks on Gaza and killed 2,750 Palestinians. The United States says a border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt will be reopened, but the timing remained unclear as the United Nations warned of dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and Israel told Palestinians living in the northern part of the enclave to leave ahead of a military operation.

""Over the past few days, I‚Äôve traveled to Israel, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt,"" Blinken said Monday on X. ""What I‚Äôve heard from every partner is a shared view to prevent the conflict from spreading, to safeguard innocent lives, and to get assistance to those in Gaza who need it.""

facebook,"Hello Biafrans, read this quickly before Facebook shut it down. Hamas is one of the agitating group seeking for the freedom of Palestine. Of course there is nothing wrong in asking for your freedom, but Hamas got it wrong when they invaded Israel and start killing innocent people without provocation. As I said before, there is nothing wrong agitating for your freedom peacefully. The world turned against Hamas when they start killing innocent civilians. IPOB and every Biafra agitating groups should learn from the terrible mistake of Hamas. In no circumstances should we touch or harm innocent unarmed civilians. You see why DOS are very careful, you see why they are guiding and protecting IPOB from government infiltrators. Innocent people should be protected always mostly women and children. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu warned us that we MUST never give our enemy the reason to demonize what we are doing. Hamas gave Isreal the reason to demonize and destroy them. The honest truth is that, the action of hamas against Israel is pure terrorism, you don't invade people's home, murdered them, murdered kids, took women and children hostage and expect the world to support you, only an insane will support that . You cannot blame Israel because they have capitalised in the costly mistake of Hamas to invent their anger. Before the world will succeed in camling and stopping Israel, the damages will be immense. Let us not follow the conflict without learning something that will guide and protect our quest for freedom.-- MEG",,349,"{'like_count': 205, 'comment_count': 36, 'num_users': 98886}",Emeka Gift Official,,2023-10-16 17:32:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/340920875_1244747009477253_7269165846461947053_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rwUpBW1rBmUAX_4ywgj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfANTs3U8_bry53ua6f0Lk6riqVORsuug4j0ZwGJM0r7Lw&oe=6559B013,https://www.facebook.com/100051947213062/posts/883304923411073,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391745071_883304960077736_407009597569927989_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=gz4M0kCnG64AX9bpKni&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD_sKYzNpx-_nD9olvFkyoZYEZwnx7HnObZx59Sg_t3zw&oe=6531DB3E

facebook,"Proverbs Chapter 13

‚ÄúA wise child accepts a parent‚Äôs discipline; a mocker refuses to listen to correction. Wise words will win you a good meal, but treacherous people have an appetite for violence. Those who control their tongue will have a long life; opening your mouth can ruin everything. Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper. The godly hate lies; the wicked cause shame and disgrace. Godliness guards the path of the blameless, but the evil are misled by sin. Some who are poor pretend to be rich; others who are rich pretend to be poor. The rich can pay a ransom for their lives, but the poor won‚Äôt even get threatened. The life of the godly is full of light and joy, but the light of the wicked will be snuffed out. Pride leads to conflict; those who take advice are wise. Wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears; wealth from hard work grows over time. Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a dream fulfilled is a tree of life. People who despise advice are asking for trouble; those who respect a command will succeed. The instruction of the wise is like a life-giving fountain; those who accept it avoid the snares of death. A person with good sense is respected; a treacherous person is headed for destruction. Wise people think before they act; fools don‚Äôt‚Äîand even brag about their foolishness. An unreliable messenger stumbles into trouble, but a reliable messenger brings healing. If you ignore criticism, you will end in poverty and disgrace; if you accept correction, you will be honored. It is pleasant to see dreams come true, but fools refuse to turn from evil to attain them. Walk with the wise and become wise; associate with fools and get in trouble. Trouble chases sinners, while blessings reward the righteous. Good people leave an inheritance to their grandchildren, but the sinner‚Äôs wealth passes to the godly. A poor person‚Äôs farm may produce much food, but injustice sweeps it all away. Those who spare the rod of discipline hate their children. Those who love their children care enough to discipline them. The godly eat to their hearts‚Äô content, but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.‚Äù

facebook,"Spiritual Enemies In a battle, it is imperative to identify your enemy. If you are not aware of the point of your attack, you are vulnerable. Paul had many enemies. Some resented him, others hated him, and others wanted to kill him. Some, who were supposedly on his side, sought to harm him and his ministry (Acts 9:23; Phil. 1:17; 2 Tim. 1:15; 1 Tim. 1:20; 2 Tim. 4:14). In spite of the persecution he faced, Paul never lost sight of his real enemy. Paul was wary of Satan. When people attacked him, he knew they were not his real opponents. They were simply unwitting instruments of the spiritual forces of darkness. When you meet opposition to your faith, your first reaction may be anger toward your antagonist. This may divert your attention from the deeper, spiritual dimensions of your conflict. Your adversary may be hopelessly into sin. Rather than retaliating, you should immediately and earnestly intercede for that person. Your opponent‚Äôs hostility is your invitation to become involved in God‚Äôs redemptive work to free him or her from spiritual oppression. Be alert to the spiritual warfare around you. It is real and potentially destructive to you and those you care about. Knowing your real foe will protect you from bitterness and unforgiveness. Your hope lies in the reality that ‚ÄúHe who is in you is greater than he who is in the world‚Äù (1 John 4:4). Do not place your hope in humanity, but steadfastly trust in the One who has already defeated your enemy. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.

facebook,"Israel‚Äôs ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely said there is ‚Äúno humanitarian crisis‚Äù in Gaza during an interview on Sky News on Monday, October 16. The remarks came shortly after UN officials described the situation in Gaza as ""an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe.‚Äù When the news anchor asked if Hotovely acknowledges that there was collateral damage to civilians, she claimed that Israel is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than any other Western army in the past, comparing the attacks to the U.S.-led coalition fighting against ISIS. The Israeli Air Force said the country dropped more than 6,000 bombs on the Gaza Strip during the first six days of the conflict. Human rights groups have called the crisis in Gaza a form of collective punishment for Palestinians, as the 2.3 million civilians living in the 25-mile-long strip face near-constant bombardment and the blockade of essential supplies and services like water, food, and power. Civilians remain the most impacted in the ongoing conflict. More than 1,400 Israelis have died, and at least 199 of its citizens are being held as hostages. Meanwhile nearly 2,800 civilians have died in Gaza, including at least 12 journalists and 12 UN workers. #Israel #Palestine #humanitariancrisis #SkyNews #Gaza #GazaCrisis #GazaStrip",,339,"{'like_count': 158, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 121062286}",CGTN,,2023-10-16 21:32:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/240501168_398442308315914_1975708148483497397_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fqFJPm2ePcQAX_EttAj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmpHfEtK6PszswEM-kc4fo5ZDurnAeUaRWl6uD79W1bw&oe=655A1719,https://www.facebook.com/100044504436603/posts/971888214304651,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393175565_715759967265282_3151421298706663248_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=10hzgUANu20AX-sq0yq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB94lw4gbDQEqw_0nIEJ0VJ4n4pKQD-X7RNR3_tMhaYgQ&oe=6531B89B

facebook,"Our wounded parts want to hold onto small things and use them as proof that we're not lovable, not good enough, that our partners are out to get us. A big part of learning to be happy in relationship is noticing when our ego wants to indulge in our story of brokenness and choosing to let go instead. What do I mean by ""indulging in a story of brokenness""? When we've been wounded, our ego builds an identity around it. We may not even realize that we're carrying around stories of being unworthy or unlovable, or that we unconsciously feel drawn to friction, tension, or drama in relationship. I see Conscious Relationship as the practice of learning to cultivate, harness and carefully direct our energy in a positive direction. When we're wired to fight, defend, poke and prod or fall into self-pity - it actually takes a lot of energetic practice to let go in the moments where we're feeling activated and have an opportunity to feed the story. Many of us say we want harmony, but actually we quite enjoy conflict on some level and we're not being honest with ourselves about that. Maybe what we really enjoy is just the energy - the intensity of feeling or the attention we're receiving. And so we get to ask ourselves - is this how I want to use my energy? Do I need to respond to the thing my partner just said or did with more fire? Do I want to spend my energy on arguing, being right, proving a point, or can I channel this energy back into my heart and express myself in a way that will create an opportunity to deepen in love? Choosing peace isn't as simple as saying we want it. Choosing peace is a life-long practice of self-observation, dancing with energy and choosing where to put it. Taking deep breaths, Seeing our partners heart, Responding with a loving statement rather than being defensive (even when you're annoyed), or simply finding a tree to admire ... are all ways to ground into the present moment and realize that life is too precious to spend wasting our energy away on things that don't matter. üåø @sheleanaaiyana *This post isn't directed to those in abusive dynamics.*",,306,"{'like_count': 136, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 256997}",Rising Woman,,2023-10-16 17:59:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/278057343_5019599971464706_9021840297017780910_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YKQUE7RNbtIAX-pvA1n&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB7wzoon5Ai9AjRYmv1mjYalrvRU4MFYd0xukazLpgYfg&oe=655B5965,https://www.facebook.com/100067744734817/posts/660577089543776,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391629951_18391939762009478_6860569508890008636_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Z-9KUrFaglcAX-MP-4J&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBBC7Zk6oxTTxeVDrtW33HYybOX56tDU5mQW3Z-Fezvlg&oe=6532E32E

facebook,"The first image is of Wadea al Fayoume, a beautiful Palestinian American boy dressed in a red checked shirt wearing a plastic hat that reads happy birthday. It was taken a few weeks ago when he turned 6. The second image is a mugshot of Joseph M Czuba, the 71 year old landlord who stabbed Wadea and his mother in their home in Illinois yesterday. She survived but is in serious condition. He died from his injuries. Officers have enough evidence to charge Czuba with a hate crime and announce that he targeted Wadea and his mother ""for being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and Israelis"". Over the last few days, Jews have been reaching out to me because they say they feel scared. And I get it. Situations like this always cause a rise in Antisemitism. BUT IT WORKS BOTH WAYS. Situations like this always cause a rise in Islamophobia too. And the first child to die on US/UK soil since the war started is a Palestinian one. I encourage all my Jewish friends to take a long hard look at this photograph and remember his name the next time you feel scared and use that as a means to justify your Zionism. Also, do not ever forget who colonised Palestine in the late 19th/early 20th century. Do not ever forget who gave the land (like it was theirs to give) to make way for an Israeli state. Do not ever forget which countries profit the most from the sales of arms and who are invested in maintaining a ""strong friendship"" with a country in the Middle East to suit its own needs. And most of all do not forget the role we all play in encouraging despicable human beings like Czuba to murder innocent children in order to make himself feel better. I hope he gets everything that's coming to him. Ps. We all know how Meta are suppressing posts that include certain terms but I refuse to be cowed by that.

We aimed to amplify their voices on a global scale and bring attention to their plight. The marathon was themed as ""The Right to Freedom of Movement,"" a message we strongly believe in and desire to convey to the world. Our goal was to shed light on the constraints placed on the freedom of movement in #Palestine and underscore the daily challenges that the Palestinians encounter in their pursuit of fundamental rights. Our dedication to upholding human rights and unwavering support for the Palestinian people remain resolute. I urge all individuals with the means and influence to join us in raising awareness about this issue.

Here is the updated info: Our new archaeology facility, the Mary C. Beaudry Community Archaeology Center, is about to open to the public, and we are celebrating with YOU! Join us on Wednesday, October 25 from 9am-5pm, for an open house event.

Our new facility is in the same building we were in before, but down a floor, at the City of Boston Archival Center, 201 Rivermoor Street, in the West Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. There will be a ribbon cutting with special guests at 9am. Our new facility features: -two processing laboratories -an artifact digitizing lab with state-of-the-art 3D scanners, printers, and photography equipment -our artifact repository of over 1,000,000 artifacts from dozens of ancient and historical sites in Boston -an extensive historical ceramic and lithic raw material comparative type collection -a specialized wet laboratory -a research library featuring over 2,000 reference books and archaeological reports -museum exhibit spaces, an amazing new mural, and some of the nicest and most knowledgeable archaeologists around. We‚Äôre also neighbors to the amazing City Archives team as well as archivists and collections librarians from the BPDA and Boston Public Library, so there‚Äôs plenty to do, see, and research while you‚Äôre here. Can‚Äôt make it on the 25th? Our exhibits will be open and viewable year-round during normal business hours on the first floor of the City of Boston Archival Center at 201 Rivermoor Street.

Everything is a constant coming and going, taking and letting go... learn wisely from nature; from the waves of the sea... and learn from yourself; of your breath... Stay at peace. It is the restless mind that lashes out. Where will I go? To do? No one has ever been lost on the way, no one was left without shelter. In the Universe there is always a path, a guide, a route. Stay at peace. What is meant to go will go anyway. What has to stay will remain. Keep it in mind. Stay at peace. As much as you try to retain all the air in your lungs, you will have to release it or else the same retained air will drown you. Stay at peace. Too much effort, too much turbulence is never a good sign... too much effort and turbulence is a sign of conflict with the Universe. Stay at peace. Relationships, jobs, home, family, friends and great loves... Surrender everything to Earth and Heaven. When you can take care and protect, water with love, attend and feed, contemplate and enjoy, pray and dance but then... let what should bloom and the dry leaves tear themselves away. Stay at peace. What goes away always leaves room for something new: they are the Universal Laws... And never think that there is nothing good for you anymore, you just have to stop containing what you have to let go. Stay at peace. Remember that every process is a learning experience for your life. Although some are less pleasant than others, their goal will always be to teach you. Receive every lesson with LOVE. Stay at peace. Only when your journey ends, then the possibilities end, but only until then. So let it all fall apart, let go, let be. Nothing is static... the Universe is in constant motion... üñämariomelito Love and Light, Michelle Price",,277,"{'like_count': 91, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 76707}",Healing World,,2023-10-16 14:48:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/244503150_5395823550432019_1786504953199090537_n.jpg?stp=c9.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3s4G4p7rkAQAX91KsQJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA6QyBXTKozU9CkNxLzLQ8_cQYPaJnVCbwf0G5LYu9YBg&oe=655AD24E,https://www.facebook.com/groups/538527263734348/permalink/1078471879739881,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391603303_7859613107386372_4938388296370172848_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3BOxNSmyJVEAX8mgTmh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAbokT6IvusbOrnWvuQA3rvx2FfFYaLfToALG7AGPGg8w&oe=65324139

In this year of warring for our promise, we will come up against the gate of our enemy and are seeing this conflict manifest in God‚Äôs covenant land. On Friday afternoon, I was interviewed by Stephen Strang, founder and CEO of Charisma Media. He asked me to share what I see prophetically about the war in Israel. As I shared with him, this is God‚Äôs war against the terrorists of His covenant.

facebook,"Last Saturday, those of us in the United States woke up to the news of terror attacks by Hamas against ordinary civilians in Israel. As devastating reports from the region continue to hit our inboxes and internet browsers, it‚Äôs been hard to escape the onslaught of information, misinformation, and insensitive comments about the conflict in Israel and Palestine. It also became immediately clear that our Jewish friends and loved ones are hurting and terrified. So are our Muslim friends and loved ones. We are all hurting as we witness this heartbreaking story that continues to unfold.

These two will never run out of fun things to do as both love variety and getting out and about traveling around exploring different foreign cultures and socializing making new friends. While The Twins are smart, adaptable yet unpredictable so is Aquarius and while The Water Barrier is emotional and temperamental so are The Twins so it will be easy for both parties to overcome each other's flaws and bring their relationship ever closer. Things will be even better for these two strong personalities if they also have compatible moon and rising signs in their birth charts (i.e Gemini Sun, Aquarius Moon and Leo Rising like me and Aquarius Sun, Gemini Moon and Aries/Sagittarius Rising).

facebook,"7 practical lessons from the book ""People Can't Drive You Crazy if You Don't Give Them the Keys"" by Mike Bechtle ""People Can't Drive You Crazy if You Don't Give Them the Keys"" is a self-help book written by Mike Bechtle. The book explores the concept of personal boundaries and how they can be instrumental in maintaining healthy relationships and managing difficult people. 1. Take responsibility for your own emotions One of the key lessons from the book is that we have control over our own emotions and reactions. We often give others the power to affect our mood and well-being, but in reality, it is up to us how we choose to respond. By taking responsibility for our own emotions, we can maintain a sense of peace and control in our lives. 2. Set healthy boundaries Setting boundaries is crucial in maintaining healthy relationships. The book emphasizes the importance of establishing clear boundaries with others, both in terms of what we will and will not tolerate. By doing so, we can protect ourselves from unnecessary stress and conflict, and create healthier dynamics in our relationships. 3. Practice empathy and understanding The book encourages us to practice empathy and understanding towards others. It reminds us that everyone has their own struggles, insecurities, and challenges. By trying to understand where others are coming from, we can foster compassion and build stronger connections with them. 4. Choose your battles wisely Not every situation requires a response or confrontation. The book advises us to choose our battles wisely and consider whether it is worth engaging in conflict or getting upset over minor issues. By prioritizing what truly matters, we can conserve our energy and focus on more important aspects of our lives. 5. Communicate effectively Effective communication is essential in any relationship. The book emphasizes the importance of expressing our thoughts and feelings clearly and assertively, while also being open to listening to others. By improving our communication skills, we can avoid misunderstandings, resolve conflicts, and build stronger connections with those around us. 6. Practice self-care Taking care of ourselves is crucial in maintaining our mental and emotional well-being. The book emphasizes the importance of self-care and encourages us to prioritize activities that recharge and rejuvenate us. By practising self-care, we can better manage stress, improve our overall happiness, and be more resilient in dealing with challenging situations. 7. Focus on what you can control Lastly, the book reminds us to focus on what we can control rather than getting caught up in things beyond our influence. By directing our energy towards the things we have power over, we can avoid unnecessary frustration and maintain a sense of peace and balance in our lives.

facebook,"Hello Biafrans, read this quickly before Facebook shut it down. Hamas is one of the agitating group seeking for the freedom of Palestine. Of course there is nothing wrong in asking for your freedom, but Hamas got it wrong when they invaded Israel and start killing innocent people without provocation. As I said before, there is nothing wrong agitating for your freedom peacefully. The world turned against Hamas when they start killing innocent civilians. IPOB and every Biafra agitating groups should learn from the terrible mistake of Hamas. In no circumstances should we touch or harm innocent unarmed civilians. You see why DOS are very careful, you see why they are guiding and protecting IPOB from government infiltrators. Innocent people should be protected always mostly women and children. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu warned us that we MUST never give our enemy the reason to demonize what we are doing. Hamas gave Isreal the reason to demonize and destroy them. The honest truth is that, the action of hamas against Israel is pure terrorism, you don't invade people's home, murdered them, murdered kids, took women and children hostage and expect the world to support you, only an insane will support that . You cannot blame Israel because they have capitalised in the costly mistake of Hamas to invent their anger. Before the world will succeed in camling and stopping Israel, the damages will be immense. Let us not follow the conflict without learning something that will guide and protect our quest for freedom.-- MEG",,245,"{'like_count': 142, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 60412}",Family Writers Press International,,2023-10-16 17:51:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/304831700_441202758028029_4226170210360163610_n.jpg?stp=c8.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=PVoRAD9IDJUAX9Buinl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA9UfCxITDAFSOnX_YOmA4f19hKpMCLXm8uxgBP0ssTSg&oe=655A9FAB,https://www.facebook.com/100064149245087/posts/711603264321309,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393447043_711603297654639_2703830208868900769_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bO7Qwqwa1ocAX-Hkafm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAur1GTBGc-0F1KJvXL0moXs7r7UL7KZ6YNgfRDn1KYBA&oe=653867B0

facebook,"SOLIDARITY WITH PALESTINE - RALLY AT RIALTO ROUNDABOUT FRIDAY OCT 20 FROM 5:30 PM As Israel continues its relentless bombardment of civilians in the Gaza strip, alongside increased repression in the West Bank, we must condemn their collective punishment of the Palestinian people. Israel has cut off all supplies to Gaza, including medical supplies, electricity, food, water, and fuel. They ordered over 1 million people to flee the Northern end of Gaza, then bombed the designated evacuation routes. They have ordered the evacuation of hospitals, with the threat of bombing. These are war crimes and must be condemned as such. There are not two equal sides to this conflict. Israel is a viciously racist apartheid state, armed to the teeth by the Western powers. They carry out their brutality with the full backing of NATO, the US and EU.

facebook,"RANK: FIRST LIEUTENANT (RANK AT PRESENTATION: CAPTAIN; HIGHEST RANK: COLONEL) CONFLICT/ERA: VIETNAM WAR UNIT/COMMAND: ARMY ELEMENT, U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND MILITARY SERVICE BRANCH: U.S. ARMY MEDAL OF HONOR ACTION DATE: MARCH 9, 1968 MEDAL OF HONOR ACTION PLACE: KIEN PHONG PROVINCE, REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM CITATION For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Capt. Jacobs (then 1st Lt.), Infantry, distinguished himself while serving as assistant battalion adviser, 2d Battalion, 16th Infantry, 9th Infantry Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam. The 2d Battalion was advancing to contact when it came under intense heavy machine-gun and mortar fire from a Viet Cong battalion positioned in well-fortified bunkers. As the 2d Battalion deployed into attack formation, its advance was halted by devastating fire. Capt. Jacobs, with the command element of the lead company, called for and directed air strikes on the enemy positions to facilitate a renewed attack. Due to the intensity of the enemy fire and heavy casualties to the command group, including the company commander, the attack stopped and the friendly troops became disorganized. Although wounded by mortar fragments, Capt. Jacobs assumed command of the allied company, ordered a withdrawal from the exposed position, and established a defensive perimeter. Despite profuse bleeding from head wounds which impaired his vision, Capt. Jacobs, with complete disregard for his safety, returned under intense fire to evacuate a seriously wounded adviser to the safety of a wooded area where he administered lifesaving first aid. He then returned through heavy automatic-weapons fire to evacuate the wounded company commander. Capt. Jacobs made repeated trips across the fire-swept, open rice paddies, evacuating wounded and their weapons. On three separate occasions, Capt. Jacobs contacted and drove off Viet Cong squads who were searching for allied wounded and weapons, single-handedly killing three and wounding several others. His gallant actions and extraordinary heroism saved the lives of one U.S. adviser and 13 allied soldiers. Through his effort the allied company was restored to an effective fighting unit and prevented defeat of the friendly forces by a strong and determined enemy. Capt. Jacobs, by his gallantry and bravery in action in the highest traditions of the military service, has reflected great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.",,228,"{'like_count': 159, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 101613}",Medal of Honor Recipients,,2023-10-16 15:00:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/348227099_223624567080463_4100071306762863482_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=KSLlEyuhuAMAX9M9K9s&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDBUWPDfd7Rbj5QELfIRxwLKU1nhUQO-TLwUdDxO901Jg&oe=655A9F61,https://www.facebook.com/100070106733600/posts/618381457175407,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/378567547_602590582087828_4035259294065411410_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fTbNg7jSatoAX9aV5e4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAaRhQF3SE2gz72er7nW5W7gWmkl9aIxhWQ8MAZM8Yjxw&oe=653B2CFE
facebook,"DAILY MANNA TUESDAY OCTOBER 17, 2023 NO BOUNDARIES KEY VERSE: ‚ÄúThus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked‚Äù (Amos 2:4). TEXT: AMOS 2:1-5 All men are equal before God. As the ultimate Judge of all creations, God does not consider background, colour, race or social status as a condition for determining the end of all men. As shown in Proverbs 3:1, God requires all men irrespective of where they come from not to forget His law. This forms the fulcrum of today‚Äôs text. God spoke to Prophet Amos about His resolve to judge Moab and Judah based on their transgressions. As for Moab, God promised not to ‚Äúturn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime‚Äù. In the case of Judah, God frowned at their flagrant disregard of His words. As a result, He insisted on bringing punishment upon them ‚Äúbecause they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments‚Ä¶‚Äù Moab was a Gentile nation, which was constantly in conflict with the Israelites. Amos proclaimed Moab‚Äôs doom for seizing and burning the king of Edom. In its case, Judah was out of the 12 tribes that constituted Israel. Judah, like Moab, transgressed the word of the Lord. Even though Judah was a tribe of Israel, God did not spare them. Rather, He promised to send fire upon Judah and devour the palaces of Jerusalem for despising His laws. This account reveals that God is neither of the Jews nor of the Gentiles exclusively. He is the God of all creation. He never discriminates based on background, colour, ethnicity, political class or social status. He is the ultimate Judge, who determines the actions and deeds of all men purely based on equity, fairness and justice. He demands outright compliance with His word as a condition for walking with Him and ultimately escaping eternal damnation. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: God‚Äôs judgment does not respect a sinner‚Äôs status.

facebook,"Hello Biafrans, read this quickly before Facebook shut it down. Hamas is one of the agitating group seeking for the freedom of Palestine. Of course there is nothing wrong in asking for your freedom, but Hamas got it wrong when they invaded Israel and start killing innocent people without provocation. As I said before, there is nothing wrong agitating for your freedom peacefully. The world turned against Hamas when they start killing innocent civilians. IPOB and every Biafra agitating groups should learn from the terrible mistake of Hamas. In no circumstances should we touch or harm innocent unarmed civilians. You see why DOS are very careful, you see why they are guiding and protecting IPOB from government infiltrators. Innocent people should be protected always mostly women and children. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu warned us that we MUST never give our enemy the reason to demonize what we are doing. Hamas gave Isreal the reason to demonize and destroy them. The honest truth is that, the action of hamas against Israel is pure terrorism, you don't invade people's home, murdered them, murdered kids, took women and children hostage and expect the world to support you, only an insane will support that . You cannot blame Israel because they have capitalised in the costly mistake of Hamas to invent their anger. Before the world will succeed in camling and stopping Israel, the damages will be immense.

What‚Äôs the harm if the rich want to underwrite green causes? I think there are (at least) two broad types of problems. First and perhaps most obvious is the risk that the influence of big money will bend the agenda of environmentalism to accommodate donors‚Äô business interests, or at least will make it impossible to be sure that this does not happen. Giridharadas, who is a gifted aphorist, has said that, for many MarketWorlders, making a difference is the wingman of making a killing. This problem especially applies to the many big money environmental donors who acquire their fortunes from unambiguously dirty businesses. Even putting aside direct conflict-of-interest problems, it‚Äôs hard to fully swallow the argument that spending lavishly on environmental causes actually offsets the accumulation of enormous wealth through ethically or environmentally questionable means. A related and similarly dubious rationale frequently offered by green NGOs for courting the patronage of the 1% boils down to a belief that it takes a good guy with a fat wallet to stop a bad guy with a fat wallet.

facebook,"If you've seen our last videos, you know that we don't have many photos in the country of Chad because photos in certain areas are frowned upon. But we wanted to share a few of our memories along with a little about what we learned about the incredible people of Chad. First, a little info about the country. Chad is a landlocked country in Central Africa that has a deep and complex history. It's at the crossroads of the Saharan and sub-Saharan regions, and encompasses deserts, savannahs, and mountains. The country gained independence in 1960, but its history has been marred by political instability and conflict, which continue to impact it today. Chad is currently facing daily internal conflict and security challenges. A long civil war, intermittent rebellions, and ethnic tensions have plagued the country, leading to instability and displacement of populations. The Chadian people are stuck in the middle of all this conflict. Despite the many challenges people face, Chad is home to a resilient and diverse population known for its warmth and hospitality. The Chadian people are composed of over 200 different ethnic groups, and are known for their strong sense of community, often coming together in times of need. Despite the ongoing conflicts, they continue to strive for a better future, working towards peace, stability, and development for their nation. Even though we didn't speak their language (there are actually 100+ different local languages spoken in Chad in addition to French!), we met so many incredibly friendly people who went out of their way to welcome us to their country.

facebook,"7 practical lessons from the book ""People Can't Drive You Crazy if You Don't Give Them the Keys"" by Mike Bechtle ""People Can't Drive You Crazy if You Don't Give Them the Keys"" is a self-help book written by Mike Bechtle. The book explores the concept of personal boundaries and how they can be instrumental in maintaining healthy relationships and managing difficult people. 1. Take responsibility for your own emotions One of the key lessons from the book is that we have control over our own emotions and reactions. We often give others the power to affect our mood and well-being, but in reality, it is up to us how we choose to respond. By taking responsibility for our own emotions, we can maintain a sense of peace and control in our lives. 2. Set healthy boundaries Setting boundaries is crucial in maintaining healthy relationships. The book emphasizes the importance of establishing clear boundaries with others, both in terms of what we will and will not tolerate. By doing so, we can protect ourselves from unnecessary stress and conflict, and create healthier dynamics in our relationships. 3. Practice empathy and understanding The book encourages us to practice empathy and understanding towards others. It reminds us that everyone has their own struggles, insecurities, and challenges. By trying to understand where others are coming from, we can foster compassion and build stronger connections with them. 4. Choose your battles wisely Not every situation requires a response or confrontation. The book advises us to choose our battles wisely and consider whether it is worth engaging in conflict or getting upset over minor issues. By prioritizing what truly matters, we can conserve our energy and focus on more important aspects of our lives. 5. Communicate effectively Effective communication is essential in any relationship. The book emphasizes the importance of expressing our thoughts and feelings clearly and assertively, while also being open to listening to others. By improving our communication skills, we can avoid misunderstandings, resolve conflicts, and build stronger connections with those around us. 6. Practice self-care Taking care of ourselves is crucial in maintaining our mental and emotional well-being. The book emphasizes the importance of self-care and encourages us to prioritize activities that recharge and rejuvenate us. By practising self-care, we can better manage stress, improve our overall happiness, and be more resilient in dealing with challenging situations. 7. Focus on what you can control Lastly, the book reminds us to focus on what we can control rather than getting caught up in things beyond our influence. By directing our energy towards the things we have power over, we can avoid unnecessary frustration and maintain a sense of peace and balance in our lives.

facebook,"US Hate Crime | US Landlord Murders 6-Year-Old Child | Police Link The Attack To Israel Hamas War . . US Hate Crime | In a shocking hate crime in Illinois, a landlord was charged with murder and a hate crime for allegedly stabbing a Muslim woman and a six-year-old boy multiple times. The attack has been linked to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. The child tragically succumbed to his injuries in the hospital, while his mother remains in critical condition. Detectives determined that the victims were targeted due to their Muslim faith and the Middle Eastern conflict. U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the attack, emphasizing the need to reject all forms of hate and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has claimed many lives on both sides of the conflict.

facebook,"The Nature of the Final Battle, October 16
The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation. Jeremiah 50:25. Mar 297.1
At His own will God summons the forces of nature to overthrow the might of His enemies‚Äî‚Äúfire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word.‚Äù Psalm 148:8. When the heathen Amorites had set themselves to resist His purposes, God interposed, casting down ‚Äúgreat stones from heaven‚Äù upon the enemies of Israel. We are told of a greater battle to take place in the closing scenes of earth‚Äôs history, when Jehovah ‚Äúhath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation.‚Äù Jeremiah 50:25. ‚ÄúHast thou,‚Äù he inquires, ‚Äúentered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?‚Äù Job 38:22, 23. Mar 297.2
The revelator describes the destruction that is to take place when the ‚Äúgreat voice out of the temple of heaven‚Äù announces, ‚ÄúIt is done.‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúThere fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent.‚Äù Revelation 16:17, 21. Mar 297.3
In the last scenes of this earth‚Äôs history, war will rage. Mar 297.4
The powers of evil will not yield up the conflict without a struggle. But Providence has a part to act in the battle of Armageddon. Mar 297.5
The Captain of the Lord‚Äôs host will stand at the head of the angels of heaven to direct the battle. Mar 297.6
He on whose vesture is written the name, King of kings and Lord of lords, leads forth the armies of heaven on white horses, clothed in fine linen, clean and white. Mar 297.7
When He shall come to the earth again, He will shake ‚Äúnot the earth only, but also heaven.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll‚Äù; ‚Äúthe elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.‚Äù But ‚Äúthe Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.‚Äù Hebrews 12:26; Isaiah 24:20; 34:4; 2 Peter 3:10; Joel 3:16.

And if you don‚Äôt know the history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, you‚Äôre likely to believe that narrative. But history and context are important to understand. Calls for peace have been attempted for multiple times over the past few decades. Israel has made MULTIPLE concessions in an attempt to bring this conflict to an end. Every single time, however, those deals have been rejected by the Palestinian government. Why? Because there is no deal that can be made that Palestine or any other terroristic anti-Semitic group will agree with, other than the absolute destruction of the Jewish people. Israel has offered a two-state solution. It was turned down.

facebook,"There are outlaw states whose intentions are demonstrably evil, whether supporting terrorism or developing nuclear, biological and chemical weapons which will be used to threaten us. We are entirely justified under the right of self-defence in using force to prevent them from realising their ambitions. If it can be done by negotiation, of course, that is better. But negotiations are rarely satisfactory with regimes for whom truth and honour mean nothing. Israel showed the way by its pre-emptive strike to destroy Iraq's nuclear potential in the early eighties. Just imagine what would have been the prospects for peace in the Middle East if Iraq had acquired nuclear weapons. The use of force in this way is never to be undertaken lightly. The risks will always be great. But if we give up the option of pre-emptive action, we deprive ourselves of the only language which evil regimes understand and the only effective measure to protect ourselves from their schemes. ____ 1995 Aug 4 Fr, Margaret Thatcher.

facebook,"Israel‚Äôs ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely said there is ‚Äúno humanitarian crisis‚Äù in Gaza during an interview on Sky News on Monday, October 16. The remarks came shortly after UN officials described the situation in Gaza as ""an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe.‚Äù When the news anchor asked if Hotovely acknowledges that there was collateral damage to civilians, she claimed that Israel is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than any other Western army in the past, comparing the attacks to the U.S.-led coalition fighting against ISIS. The Israeli Air Force said the country dropped more than 6,000 bombs on the Gaza Strip during the first six days of the conflict. Human rights groups have called the crisis in Gaza a form of collective punishment for Palestinians, as the 2.3 million civilians living in the 25-mile-long strip face near-constant bombardment and the blockade of essential supplies and services like water, food, and power. Civilians remain the most impacted in the ongoing conflict. More than 1,400 Israelis have died, and at least 199 of its citizens are being held as hostages. Meanwhile nearly 2,800 civilians have died in Gaza, including at least 12 journalists and 12 UN workers. #Israel #Palestine #humanitariancrisis #SkyNews #Gaza #GazaCrisis #GazaStrip",,195,"{'like_count': 47, 'comment_count': 33, 'num_users': 166635}",PandaPaws,,2023-10-16 21:30:34,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312147233_487929943381620_7168779904564889165_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=o9qa7qQsuT4AX8IfWJ3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBNPHsdZ2GqsXbdm_3PmvC-0uwc-tyPbq89CiMVheilQg&oe=655AB115,https://www.facebook.com/100064938556454/posts/715773050597307,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393175565_715759967265282_3151421298706663248_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=10hzgUANu20AX-sq0yq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDDVXJjXaTUQ9hBEEfvvpBkVd_fDVbLYyb-vb-xC5iwVw&oe=6533B2DB

facebook,"Read‚Ä¶this not a visual post! ‚Ä¶Spot on! - From Jonathan CooküëáüèΩ (on twitter/X, whatever). (the image for obvious sm reasons): The missing context for what's happening in Gaza is that Israel has been working night and day to ethnically cleanse the Palestinian people from their homeland since even before Israel become a state ‚Äì when it was known as the Zionist movement. Israel didn't just cleanse Palestinians in 1948, when it was founded as a Western colonial project, and again under cover of a regional war in 1967. It also worked to ethnically cleanse Palestinians every day between those dates and afterwards. The aim was to move them off their historic lands, and either expel them beyond Israel‚Äôs new, expanded borders or concentrate them into small ghettoes inside those borders ‚Äì as a holding measure until they could be expelled outside the borders. The 'settler' project, as we call it, is a misnomer. It's really Israel's ethnic cleansing programme. Israel even has a special word for it in Hebrew: 'Judaisation', or making the land Jewish. It is official government policy. Gaza was the largest of the Palestinian reservations created by Israel's ethnic cleansing programme, and the most overcrowded. To stop the inhabitants spilling out, Israel built a fence-barrier in the early 1990s to pen them in. Then when policing became too hard from within the prison, Israel pulled back in 2005 to the outer perimeter barrier. New technology allowed Israel to besiege Gaza remotely by land, sea and air in 2007, limiting the entry of food and vital items like medicine and cement for construction. Automated gun towers shot anyone who came near the fence. The navy patrolled the sea, stopping boats straying more than a kilometre or two off shore. And drones watched 24 hours a day from the sky. The people of Gaza were sealed in and largely forgotten, except when they lobbed a few rockets over the fence ‚Äì to international indignation. If they fired too many rockets, Israel bombed them mercilessly and occasionally launched a ground invasion. The rocket threat was increasingly neutralised by a rocket interception system, paid for by the US, called Iron Dome. Palestinians tried to be more inventive in finding ways to break out of their prison. They built tunnels. But Israel found ways to identify those that ran close to the fence and destroyed them. Palestinians tried to get attention by protesting en masse at the fence. Israeli snipers were ordered to shoot them in the legs, leading to thousands of amputees. The 'deterrence' seemed to work. Israel could once again sit back and let the Palestinians rot in Gaza. 'Quiet' had been restored. Until, that is, last weekend when Hamas broke out briefly and ran amok, killing civilians and soldiers alike. So Israel now needs a new policy. It looks like the ethnic cleansing programme is being applied to Gaza anew. The half of the population in the enclave's north is being herded south, where there are not the resources to cope with them. And even if there were, Israel has cut off food, water and power to everyone in Gaza. The enclave is quickly becoming a pressure cooker. The pressure is meant to build on Egypt to allow the Palestinians entry into Sinai on 'humanitarian' grounds. Whatever the media are telling you, the 'conflict' ‚Äì that is, Israel's cleansing programme ‚Äì started long before Hamas appeared on the scene. In fact, Hamas emerged very late, as the predictable response to Israel's violent colonisation project. And no turning point was reached a week ago. This has all been playing out in slow motion for more than 100 years. Ignore the fake news. Israel isn't defending itself. It's enforcing its right to continue ethnically cleansing Palestinians.",,194,"{'like_count': 93, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 26118}",Farah Nabulsi,,2023-10-16 06:55:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/195688852_332213434934042_617238846550259114_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=lqqN6IG5gXkAX_AsoPr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCrXVV8d8YBVgAEPJLnexAzDLOLRV57LZkPACcI3LB61Q&oe=657D392E,https://www.facebook.com/100044361642628/posts/867284488093598,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391680827_867283511427029_241687649492429562_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cEsjbZq1vIIAX_abymY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDBYTsQgYMd4257mmeEFn5k6_cHM11lygBnDX4X8L49aw&oe=655A50D5

facebook,"It seems, the souls of the innocent children of Palestine, refuse to journey to Heaven alone. The hundreds of children being massacred in Gaza have echoed two things: A journey with a message of peace ascending on high to join Prophet Ibrahim in Heaven, (because that‚Äôs what we believe for all kids going to Heaven), and that another precious soul, Wadea Al-Fayyoumi will join them now. Secondly and tragically, exposure to the same hate that is killing children in Gaza and unfortunately, here too, in our own backyard in Plainfield, IL. For a finger to press a button or turn a switch that sends bombs and missiles to kill innocent civilians and children in mass destruction is one horrific thing, but for a 71-year-old man to take a 12 inch military knife in his own hand and brutally, mercilessly stab a young innocent child 26 times, killing him and attempting to kill his mother, leaving her in critical condition with over a dozen stab wounds is beyond horrific, it is evil, it is Shaytan. I can‚Äôt imagine the abject fear and horror in the eyes of this helpless child looking in this evil human being‚Äôs eyes in his last moments of life. I can‚Äôt imagine the pain and grief in this mother‚Äôs heart watching helplessly as her child is killed in front of her eyes while she is gravely injured and barely clinging to life. Politicians who called for wiping Gaza out, should share in the blame for this crime. Media that tried to stir people into a frenzy, reporting biased, one-sided misinformation of the conflict should share in the responsibility of this heinous crime.

facebook,"In 1244 Henry III decided to finish Prince Dafydd of Wales once and for all. He raised a great army at Chester and marched into Gwynedd, hoping to crush Dafydd's revolt and strengthen the royal castle at Deganwy. All the chronicle sources, Welsh and English, agree this was a particularly vicious campaign. The chronicles tally with the records of Henry's administration, which contain orders to impose a trade embargo and naval blockade on North Wales. By one means or another, military conquest or economic stranglehold, Henry was determined to get a result. The war that followed was a bloody, laborious, expensive mess. Henry's commissariat failed to provide his soldiers with adequate food or winter gear, which meant they died like flies. A particularly eloquent letter, written by one of Henry's nobles, describes men camped on the bare slopes of Deganwy, exposed to rain, cold and furious Welsh guerilla attacks. Both sides behaved with utter savagery. Henry revived the custom of head-taking, whereby his soldiers were paid a bounty of twopence for the head of every slaughtered Welshman. At one point, Matthew Paris notes, a hundred heads were brought into camp. The Welsh, for their part, chopped up English prisoners on the banks of the River Conwy, within sight of their comrades. Afterwards the body parts were thrown into the water, to mingle with the bloated corpses and overturned supply ships. To get supplies, Henry ordered a fleet from Ireland. An Irish army landed on Anglesey, where it burnt the crops and massacred the populace. This, wrote Paris, was because the Irish had ‚Äúan old hatred‚Äù against the Welsh. By destroying the harvest, Henry stupidly deprived himself of the means of feeding his soldiers. After several weeks of this hell, Henry withdrew to England and left his captains to finish the job. The conflict ground on for another two years, until Gwynedd was virtually burnt and blasted out of existence. His enemy, Prince Dafydd, died in February 1246. He was only 33, and there were rumours of poison, since his hair and teeth fell out. Yet Dafydd could just as easily have succumbed to disease or malnutrition, like so many of his people. It really shouldn't have come to this: Dafydd was Henry's nephew, a grandson of King John, and married to an English noblewoman, Isabella de Braose. The whole thrust of Llywelyn the Great's policy was to produce an heir with close ties to the English court, to avoid just this type of conflict. But it happened anyway. Dafydd's early death left a power vacuum in Gwynedd. It was quickly filled by his nephews, Llywelyn and Owain Goch, sons of his half-brother Gruffudd. They were still young, and untried, and inherited a seemingly impossible situation. The relentless pressure of Henry's blockade was starting to tell. Two prominent Welsh nobles, key supporters of Llywelyn the Great and Dafydd, had already defected to the royal army. The last effective resistance was in Ceredigion, West Wales, not Gwynedd. Here, one Maelgwn Fychan held out until the end of August 1246, when he was escorted to the king by Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn. The very last resistance was offered by Maelgwn's steward, described as an old man, until he was captured on 6 November. And that, apparently, was it. It looked as though Henry III had conquered the Welsh. The king certainly thought he had imposed his power on Gwynedd: in subsequent years he referred to his 'new conquest' of North Wales. Yet Henry is not remembered as the conqueror of Wales. So how did it all unravel for him? Let's find out...",,193,"{'like_count': 169, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 16585}",The 13th Century,,2023-10-16 08:24:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/378042680_758239083010535_7244218978344724192_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jkct5pBXnm0AX9j_fVr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfASSIW55PSAzVgC12Y6coZxkYywgg_kGhvMPdwgHdbhOw&oe=6559FA92,https://www.facebook.com/100064733496838/posts/780394177461692,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391727977_780394030795040_4810233446851073362_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Uu571EBHkDYAX9NY1Kl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCNYplw2wGJ0ArEKQVC4B73p0SpuP7cKJs11gvHt0x8cA&oe=65317BB6
facebook,"I have learned with utmost sadness about the passing of the former President of Finland, H.E. Martti Ahtisaari, a friend of the Namibian liberation struggle and a leading peacemaker who played through the United Nations a pivotal role in midwifing the birth of a new Namibia. The history of Martti Athissari is incomplete without Namibia, a country he was associated with in the many roles that he occupied. First through his appointment as a senator to the Council of the United Nations Institute for Namibia (UNIN) in 1975, a position which later led to his appointment in 1978 by United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim as the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Namibia. In 1989, he was appointed by the United Nations Secretary General to assume the difficult task as the leader of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia, which was globally hailed as a model in dealing with complex transitions from conflict to peace. Major parts in the history of Namibia would be incomplete without the name of former President Ahtisaari. As a Fin, former President Ahtisaari understood fully our quest for freedom and justice. Therefore, in the roles of diplomat, negotiator, peacekeeper and blue helmet, former President Ahtisaari served the Namibian people who were seeking self-determination and justice with flying colors. As an icon in the imagination of the Namibian people, President Ahtisaari was inscribed as an honorary citizen of the Republic of Namibia, with streets and schools having been named after him in remembrance and in celebration of his exceptional deeds in the birth of a free Namibia. Therefore, today, we are not only mourning the loss of former President Ahtisaari, a friend and one of us, but we are also reaffirming the rich legacy of peace and the outstanding international public service of a Nobel peace laureate with an indelible association with Namibia. On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Namibia, I wish to extend sincere condolences to the Ahtisaari family and our sister country, Finland. May His Soul Rest in Peace Hage G.

facebook,"The 2023 Sunnyside High School Alumni Wall of Fame Inductees were recognized before kick-off at the Homecoming Football Game. Today we will be sharing their stories and hope you will help us congratulate them on their induction! First up is Sandra Rasheed, Class of 1990! Of her time in the Sunnyside School District, she demonstrated an insatiable thrust for knowledge, and took on a diverse range of subject and extracurricular activities. Her favorite memories of this time include taking a Humanities class with Mrs. Adiele who led archaeological excavations in the schoolyard. Following graduation, she attended Eastern Washington University where she earned a Bachelors of Arts in English Literature and completed a Master‚Äôs Degree in Sustainable Development at the School of International Training. With her education, determination, and passion work, Sandra blazed a trail as an advocate and humanitarian, often in areas where women were not seen as leaders. Early in her career, she worked as a Senior Associate Director of Peace and Development for the prestigious Jimmy Carter Center. Here she dedicated her work to advancing global peace programs, conflict resolution, democratization, and human rights. Her areas of oversight included Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. In this role she had a significant impact on critical issues including disease prevention, conflict resolution and the promotion of democracy. Next, she moved to Ma‚Äôan Development Center, a groundbreaking organization committed to fostering social and economic development in underserved communities. As Program Director, she played an instrumental role in designing and implementing innovative programs to tackle poverty, inequality and educational disparities through self-sufficiency and self-empowerment. In her tenure as Director of Program Development and Quality with Save the Children, Sandra harnessed her unwavering advocacy and creativity to address critical issues facing young people including access to educational, health-related and protective resources. When Sandra joined the American Near East Refugee Aid or ANEERA, she was the first woman and first Palestinian to join the organization. In the capacity of Country Director in Palestine, she worked to advance the wellbeing of refugees, families, and communities in Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon. She built partnerships and responded to economic, health, and educational needs through sustainable solutions. It is for her unwavering and visionary commitment to humanitarian causes across the globe, her exceptional contributions to humankind and the shining example of what Sunnyside High School hopes our graduates can accomplish, that we induct Sandra Rasheed into the Sunnyside High School Alumni Wall of Fame. Sandra‚Äôs brother Rashed accepted the award on her behalf.",,182,"{'like_count': 88, 'comment_count': 22, 'num_users': 11175}",Sunnyside School District,,2023-10-16 16:24:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/366934639_806295961498334_3108570387244061545_n.jpg?stp=c135.137.526.526a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LThNy_NcYqwAX9iou-o&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC-zVGEqdBmlzTtazfpoVyOArpxB7Le9P3uVU-E7lBUgQ&oe=655B9417,https://www.facebook.com/100063538122192/posts/849903023804294,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392946669_849901810471082_7195574285094764328_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=OkUxRam2DZwAX8YWgww&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCeaICAnc84BShmAm3FC5OAa3r4V9whnBvUINwqkz7rhw&oe=655A7061

In peace I understand myself and the world. In conflict I walk away. In detachment I am free. In respecting all living things I respect myself. In dedication I honour the courage within me. In eternity I have compassion for the nature of all things. In love I unconditionally accept the evolution of others. In freedom I have power. In my individuality I express the God-Force within me.

facebook,"Many in the mainstream media are already painting the narrative that any retaliation from Israel will be unwarranted and calls for ‚Äòpeace‚Äô will be on Israel‚Äôs shoulders. And if you don‚Äôt know the history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, you‚Äôre likely to believe that narrative. But history and context are important to understand. Calls for peace have been attempted for multiple times over the past few decades. Israel has made MULTIPLE concessions in an attempt to bring this conflict to an end. Every single time, however, those deals have been rejected by the Palestinian government. Why?

facebook,"TODAY‚ÄôS BIRTHDAY: ASURA *Text in English, Portuguese and Spanish Since Asura doesn't have an official birthday date, we'll be celebrating today along with Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage, his debut game. Asura is a creature born in Makai, the demon world. He's in constant conflict with Yuga, the Destroyer, for being against his plans of unification between the human world and the makai. After losing a battle, Asura ends up being imprisoned. In Samurai Shodown 64, Haohmaru manages to destroy Yuga's physical body, and with that Asura is freed. However, a year later, Yuga manages to revive and creates a clone of Asura, named Shadow Asura, to serve as his subordinate. Shadow Asura is sent on a mission to retrieve Shiki, but ends up falling in love with her and the two have a daughter, Mikoto. Asura and his clone end up joining forces to defeat Yuga once and for all, but at the last moment, Yuga tries to possess Mikoto. Asura and Shadow Asura merge into a single being, and manage to totally destroy Yuga's spirit, thus preventing the girl's body from being controlled by him. However, Mikoto still remains with a certain evil energy that she cannot get rid of. Asura fights with seven different weapons, being a dangerous opponent both at long and close range. His attacks however are not very fast, this being his only weakness. He is also a playable character in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum. _________ ANIVERSARIANTE DO DIA: ASURA Como Asura n√£o possui uma data de anivers√°rio oficial, comemoraremos hoje juntamente com Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage, seu jogo de estreia. Asura √© uma criatura nascida no Makai, o mundo dos dem√¥nios. Ele est√° em constante conflito com Yuga, o Destruidor, por ser contra seus planos de unifica√ß√£o entre o mundo dos humanos e o makai. Ap√≥s perder uma batalha, Asura acaba sendo aprisionado. Em Samurai Shodown 64, Haohmaru consegue destruir o corpo f√≠sico de Yuga, e com isso Asura √© libertado. Por√©m, um ano depois, Yuga consegue reviver e cria um clone de Asura, chamado Shadow Asura, para servir como seu subordinado. Shadow Asura √© enviado em uma miss√£o para recuperar Shiki, mas acaba se apaixonando por ela e os dois tem uma filha, Mikoto. Asura e seu clone acabam unindo for√ßas para derrotar Yuga de uma vez por todas, mas no √∫ltimo instante, Yuga tenta possuir Mikoto. Asura e Shadow Asura se fundem em um √∫nico ser, e conseguem destruir totalmente o esp√≠rito de Yuga, impedindo assim que o corpo da menina fosse controlado por ele. Por√©m, Mikoto ainda permanece com uma certa energia maligna da qual n√£o consegue se desfazer.

facebook,"SOUTH AFRICA'S PRESIDENT PLEDGES PALESTINIAN SOLIDARITY On 14 October, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa lambasted the Israeli government's orders for over one million people in Gaza to move south in preparation for a ground invasion, describing it as a genocide in the making. While standing in the South African province of Gauteng, Ramaphosa also expressed his support for the Palestinian people and conveyed his country's willingness to contribute to the resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict based on a two-state solution. It echoes a recent joint communiqu√© by the African Union and Arab League. Following an incursion by Palestinians into occupied Palestinian territories on 7 October, Israel has responded disproportionately. It has dropped more than 6,000 bombs into the densely packed Gaza Strip, killing thousands, mostly women and children. Hospitals have been overwhelmed, with key medical supplies exhausted. In what has received widespread condemnation for being collective punishment‚Äîa war crime‚ÄîIsrael shut down water, food and electricity supply to Gaza. South Africa‚Äôs stance on Palestine is continuation of a long-running tradition of solidarity. South Africa credits international solidarity for playing a part in the defeat of apartheid, a situation Palestine finds itself in today, according to multiple human rights organizations. Palestinians are discriminated against on their own land, heavily surveilled and are denied freedom of movement. Israel is building settlements on existing Palestinian villages, and has ignored countless international calls to respect Palestinian rights. South Africa is one of a growing number of countries putting out international calls for a just conclusion to the Palestinian question. Other states include Egypt and Algeria in Africa, as well as Iran and Saudi Arabia, which might just have to press pause on normalisation of ties with Israel.

facebook,"QUESTION :Whats the reason that Nyoka Longa is the one that remained out of anyone else. He doesnt strike me as the most talented at the time when there was evoloko and papa wemba. What made it that he stood the test of time and became the face of Zaiko? Was he already somewhat the face of Zaiko back then? Is he musically inclided and knows how to play a few instruments? What is it about the guy. ANSWER üåü Zaiko was founded because of Papa Wemba's voice with Pedro Felix Manuaku (who came from the previous called Belguide which was disbanded by the founders of Zaiko after discovering Papa Wemba) and Papa Wemba(then called Jules Presley) being the first musicians with the rest being recruited some days later. Zaiko was founded by D.V. Moanda, Marcelin Delo, Henry Mongombe, Andre Bita and Olemi Eshar-Eshar. Back in the days band were mostly founded and directed by donors. Alot those bands used then to have two bands. One band which was playing American-music (Pop, Soul, R&B) and the other band typical Congolese music. Zaiko was one of those bands until 1988. For people who don't know it, the first star of Zaiko was Nyoka Longo with his song La Blanche Neige which was a hit in 1970. But Zaiko was then not really a big band they used to copy Los Nickelos, which was a band of Congolese students based in Belgium. They feared Thu Zahina who were beside of Tabu Ley and Los Nickelos their rolmodels and the reference the young generation until Verckys Kiamangana and Franco Luambo killed the band in 1972 by signing the band to their label but not producing them and recruiting their best musicians. In 1971 Gina Efonge joined the band and the band changed immediatly. Zaiko started to become famous with his songs and he became then the star of the band. The same year the created the Cavacha-rhythm which all drummers of took over and is played until this day. Not long after that they created inside the band a platform called Isifi (Institut du Savoir Ideologique pour la Formation des Idoles) which had Gina Efonge, Evoloko Lay, Papa Wemba, Mavuela Somo and some other musicians, excluding Nyoka Longo. Because in Gina's eyes he was a ""yuma"" and he couldn't join them, because he came from Masina. Nyoka Longo was then mostly not singing in their songs and concerts and started then to focus on the administration of Zaiko. In 1973 Zaiko was the most popular band of Zaire and Evoloko became then the face of the band with his hits Mbeya Mbeya and Eluzam. In 1973 Gina Efonge lost his head and was replaced by Bozi Boziana. In at the end of 1974, Evoloko Lay, Papa Wemba, Mavuela Somo and Bozi Boziana decided to leave Zaiko and to form Isifi Lokole with Zaiko only being left with the instrumentists and the singers Nyoka Longo and Bimi Ombale who returned in 1973 as singer (he used to be a drummer), but was like Nyoka Longo excluded. They recruited musicians and went back to the Los Nickelos-style. They formed a dangerous singing-group (Likinga Redo, Nyoka Longo, Lengi Lenga, Bimi Ombale) called Le Quartet joined by showman Mbuta Mashakado who used to be the choreographer of Evoloko and a pop-singer in Zaiko before the split. Mbuta Mashako, Nyoka Longo and Bimi were then the start of the band. Then in 1976, Gina Efonge recovered and rejoined Zaiko. In 1977 Bozi Boziana also rejoined Zaiko and it made the band stronger, the same year Gina left to form his own band Libanko after getting his fame back. In 1978 Evoloko rejoined Zaiko and from then they started to fight against Viva La Musica about being the most popular band. But Nyoka Longo didn't like him, because he felt like Evoloko came to steal his rol as being the top-star of the band, which often resulted in conflicts. Then in 1979 Manuaku Waku became the star of the band with his hits Obi and Femme n'est Pleur Pas. The same year just before celebrating Zaiko's 10th Anniversary, Nyoka Longo and his friends fired Manuaku Waku from the band with Evoloko Lay, Bozi Boziana, Djudju-chet and many others who were making part of Zaiko. Zaiko used then to have more then 30 musicians and it was easy to split the band in 3 with them performing on three different places in Kinshasa. Manuaku then decided to start Grand Zaiko Wawa with the rest, but then Franco decided to reconcile them and they all rejoined. But the conflict between Nyoka Longo and Manuaku was so big that, Manuaku decided to leave and start his own band. The departure of Manuaku made that nobody could protect Evoloko from Nyoka Longo which made Evoloko singing barely in concerts (sometimes only 2 songs). Because Manuaku used to be the chef d'orchestre of Zaiko.

Joseph Czuba, 71, allegedly attacked his tenants in their home in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Chicago, because of the conflict between Hamas and Israel. He has been charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

Police said that the boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, was stabbed 26 times with a military-style knife, and later died in hospital. His mother, named as Hanaan Shahin, was also stabbed more than a dozen times, seriously injuring her, but she is expected to survive.

The protests come after a week's worth of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. More than 2,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed and more than 9,000 have been injured since October 7, while Israeli authorities say 1,400 of its population have died and 3,400 have been injured in the war. Currently people in Gaza have limited access to food, water, and electricity.

instagram,"The Latin Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem has offered to be exchanged for the children being held hostage in the Gaza Strip by Hamas. 

Speaking to journalists via video conference on Oct.16, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa was asked if he would be willing to offer himself in exchange to free the children hostages who were taken in Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel last week. The cardinal responded that he is willing to do anything to ‚Äúbring those children home.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAm I ready for an exchange? Anything, if that can lead to freedom and bring those children home, no problem. There is an absolute availability on my part,‚Äù the cardinal said.

Israel Defense Forces announced Monday that 199 Israeli hostages, including children, are being held by Hamas and that the military is trying to understand where they are being held in Gaza. Hamas terrorists had threatened last week to kill one hostage every time that Israel‚Äôs military bombs civilian targets in Gaza.

The cardinal underlined that it is necessary ‚Äúto find a way to get the hostages back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are willing to help, even me personally,‚Äù he added. 

Pizzaballa, who serves as the head of Latin Catholics living in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, and Cyprus, noted that he had not had any direct communication with Hamas since the surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7. 

The Vatican is willing to help mediate a peace agreement, according to Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who said in an interview Friday that the Vatican‚Äôs chief concern amid the conflict is ‚Äúthe release of Israeli hostages and the protection of innocent lives in Gaza.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI do not know how much room for dialogue there can be between Israel and the Hamas militia,‚Äù Parolin said. ‚ÄúBut if there is ‚Äî and we hope there is ‚Äî it should be pursued immediately and without delay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Holy See is ready for any necessary mediation, as always,‚Äù he said.

Pizzaballa has called for a day of prayer and fasting for peace and reconciliation in the Holy Land on Tuesday, Oct. 17, urging Catholics to organize times of prayer with Eucharistic adoration and recitation of the rosary.

On Monday, the number of publicly known hostages increased to almost 200, up from the 150 that had been spoken of since the beginning of the conflict. Experts say that Hamas has most likely locked them up in a warren of underground tunnels in the Gaza Strip, as the Israeli Air Force bombards the territory and the army prepares to invade.

Biden spoke at the Human Rights Campaign‚Äôs National Dinner this weekend, where he gave a speech surveying the state of LGBTQ+ rights across America, including promises from his administration to continue fighting for LGBTQ+ equality at home and abroad.

Biden responded that he couldn‚Äôt hear what the protestor was saying and replied, ‚ÄúWhatever you‚Äôre saying, I‚Äôm going to say thank ‚Äî I can‚Äôt hear you.‚Äù

instagram,"We must win this war of souls. In its war against Hamas, Israel has a duty to defend its territory and its citizens, but it must also defend its humanity. Our war is with Hamas, not with the Palestinian people. Palestinian civilians deserve to enjoy peace and prosperity in their homeland, and even in the midst of conflict their basic human rights should be recognized by all sides. This refers not only to Israel, but also to Egypt, which shares a border with the Gaza Strip, and which has partially sealed that border. Right now, the minds of both Israelis and Palestinians are filled to the brim with their own pain: no space is left to even acknowledge the pain of the other side. But outsiders who are not themselves immersed in pain should make an effort to empathize with all suffering humans, rather than lazily seeing only part of the terrible reality. It is the job of outsiders to help maintain a space for peace.

instagram,"This very common issue can be really confusing for both parties involved‚Ä¶

When one partner perceives another partner‚Äôs expression of needs, wants, and feedback as being critical, controlling, or ungrateful‚Ä¶ this creates a dilemma of a repeated trigger cycle‚Ä¶

Because Partner A is being triggered when their needs are dismissed and neglected and Partner B is triggered because they feel criticized and controlled by Partner A‚Äôs expression of needs, hurts, or feedback‚Ä¶ 

Thus, both partners are constantly being triggered and neither partner is consistently getting their needs met‚Ä¶ 

And round and round it goes. 

The most difficult part of these dynamics is that each partner is inevitably caught up in their Relationship Programming‚Ä¶ experiencing a perpetuation of their trauma and negative core beliefs, but because it‚Äôs familiar, they keep doing this dance on loop‚Ä¶ because well, it‚Äôs what they know.

If you recognize you‚Äôre in a dynamic where you are not ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to express needs, hurts, feedback, etc. without it leading to conflict or worse‚Ä¶ You might want to assess if this relationship is a reflection of your programming‚Ä¶ as well as a reflection of your partner‚Äôs programming. 

And, if so, it might be time to re-evaluate‚Ä¶ ‚ô•Ô∏è

instagram,"One of the best things I ever heard from a 1/2 Palestinian 1/2 American friend was if you want to know where justice lies look at how many defectors are in a conflict which essentially means ‚Äúsomeone who abandons their cause in favor of an opposing one.‚Äù In other words, look at how many people on one side of a conflict felt their conscience confronted and flipped sides or at the very least saw the humanity of the opposing side. If anyone‚Äôs gone to the famous Graffiti artist Banksy‚Äôs museum in Bethlehem you will be shocked to learn how 10,000+ Israeli soldiers left their posts because they couldn‚Äôt stomach what the state of Israel was doing to an unarmed civilian population. There are many Israeli‚Äôs who have stood for a free Palestine but how many Palestinians have decided their right to live is an unworthy cause? Probably not many. There are tens of thousands of Jews within and outside of Israel that do not abide by these harsh zionistic principles that are not synonymous with the teachings of the Torah. It is not anti-Semitic to say innocent people should not die. It is not anti-Semitic to say that people deserve water and electricity and basic human rights. The notion that to question the state of Israel is synonymous with being anti-Semitic is not only ridiculous but dangerous. I 100% condemn Hamas‚Äô acts of violence toward innocent Israeli civilians and Hamas is not the Palestinian government. What Israel is doing is the government and this government is using US tax dollars by the billions to support the extermination of an entire population of people. The painful part of this story is how much it mirrors nazi germany and what happened to the Jews themselves. The way propaganda and the news and media was used against the millions of innocent Jews that were killed during the Holocaust is now being used to exterminate the Palestinian people. As they say ‚Äúhurt people hurt people.‚Äù In history we have seen many cases of the oppressed then becoming the oppressors, so this is not new.

The boy‚Äôs mother, 32, was in serious condition with more than a dozen stab wounds, officials said. Officials said she ran into a bathroom and continued fighting off the attacker as she dialed 911.

In a tragic incident that has shocked the community, an Illinois landlord has been arrested and charged with a hate crime after allegedly stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy to death and seriously injuring his mother. The man reportedly targeted the victims based on their faith and as a response to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
__________________________________________________
According to the Associated Press, a woman identified as Hanaan Shahin, had called 911 to report that her landlord had attacked her and her child with a knife. She told the operator that she ran into a bathroom and continued to fight him off. While arriving at the scene, officers found the 32-year-old wounded woman and little boy late Saturday morning at the home located in an unincorporated area of Plainfield Township. The man suspected, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba, was found outside the residence ‚Äúsitting upright on the ground near the driveway of the residence‚Äù with cuts on his face. From there he was immediately taken into police custody. 
__________________________________________________
The innocent little boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.  The woman was seen for multiple stab wounds but is expected to survive, according to a statement. The autopsy revealed that the child had been stabbed a total of 26 times. The sheriff‚Äôs department said in a statement, ‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.‚Äù

Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy, was killed and his mother wounded in a hate crime this weekend motivated by the Israel-Gaza conflict.

Wadea was stabbed multiple times in a suburb outside Chicago. His mother Hanaan Shahin was also attacked and is still recovering in the hospital.

71-year-old Joseph Czuba‚Äîtheir landlord‚Äîwas charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crimes, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. In texts to her son‚Äôs father, Shahin recalled the landlord's words: ‚ÄòYou Muslims must die.‚Äô

Wadea was laid to rest today.

Nationwide, police are increasing protections against antisemitic and Islamophobic violence, and the FBI has reported an increase in threats to both the Jewish and Muslim communities.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office in suburban Chicago said in a statement on Sunday.‚Å†

Until the war ends.

instagram,"The Latin Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem has offered to be exchanged for the children being held hostage in the Gaza Strip by Hamas. 

Speaking to journalists via video conference on Oct.16, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa was asked if he would be willing to offer himself in exchange to free the children hostages who were taken in Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel last week. The cardinal responded that he is willing to do anything to ‚Äúbring those children home.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAm I ready for an exchange? Anything, if that can lead to freedom and bring those children home, no problem. There is an absolute availability on my part,‚Äù the cardinal said.

Israel Defense Forces announced Monday that 199 Israeli hostages, including children, are being held by Hamas and that the military is trying to understand where they are being held in Gaza. Hamas terrorists had threatened last week to kill one hostage every time that Israel‚Äôs military bombs civilian targets in Gaza.

The cardinal underlined that it is necessary ‚Äúto find a way to get the hostages back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are willing to help, even me personally,‚Äù he added. 

Pizzaballa, who serves as the head of Latin Catholics living in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, and Cyprus, noted that he had not had any direct communication with Hamas since the surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7. 

The Vatican is willing to help mediate a peace agreement, according to Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who said in an interview Friday that the Vatican‚Äôs chief concern amid the conflict is ‚Äúthe release of Israeli hostages and the protection of innocent lives in Gaza.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI do not know how much room for dialogue there can be between Israel and the Hamas militia,‚Äù Parolin said. ‚ÄúBut if there is ‚Äî and we hope there is ‚Äî it should be pursued immediately and without delay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Holy See is ready for any necessary mediation, as always,‚Äù he said.

Pizzaballa has called for a day of prayer and fasting for peace and reconciliation in the Holy Land on Tuesday, Oct. 17, urging Catholics to organize times of prayer with Eucharistic adoration and recitation of the rosary.

Jindal went on to add that Rizwan offering prayer on the cricket field amid many Indians was symbolic of the intentional depiction of his religion which stands against the spirit of the game.

‚ÄúThis very act of the player raises questions about the spirit of the match and raises a question of the ideology, the player follows while playing the match. The act of displaying his religion by Mohammed Rizwan purposefully depicts his intent to message that he is a Muslim, defeating the spirit of sports,‚Äù he said.

Rizwan¬†was seen offering prayers amid the field while his teammates were waiting for the drinks during the break, he added.

For him, the Pakistani wicket-keeping batter‚Äôs statement in his press conference regarding the dedication of his victory to the people of Gaza further attested to his religious and political ideology.",,10216,"{'like_count': 9878, 'comment_count': 338, 'num_users': 251534}",Kashmir Update ¬ÆüïØ(OFFICIAL),,2023-10-16 08:02:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/26867806_1055086524653918_4820025926949535744_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=BA7U8UELU18AX9mJPQQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB2Pt02V8rEVnRC0VqydQRid0Jt4E8H04k6lQisyQEfIg&oe=655A9126,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyc8fN-PfFG/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/358351523_328438009869332_1589505538329291104_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=V3QToz4jGYcAX-Skl3i&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDn51zSD4Ge_R0E_v_2ry7HKl3W1fWh-F2tYUkUv3df1w&oe=6553FF3D

instagram,"The 4 core needs of our nervous system:
‚Äã
1. SAFETY means that the nervous system feels secure, protected, resourced and able to regulate the intensity of emotional, physiological, psychological and relational responses. Safety is about having a stable somatic foundation from which to engage with the world.
‚Äã
When this need is not sufficiently met (embodied), the nervous system adapts through survival strategies/roles to substitute for the lack of safety. Survival means seeking safety in adaptive ways. 
‚Äã
When this dynamic becomes ongoing, we experience an internal conflict between 2 opposing needs: the need for safety (still unmet) and the momentum to seek safety in survival ways because that's what the system did for so long. 
‚Äã
2. CONNECTION: Humans are social beings, and our nervous system has a profound need for connection. This goes beyond human connection; The nervous system is an interconnected system. It needs to feel itself as part of Nature. 
‚Äã
When this need is not met or insufficiently met, the nervous system will perceive the relational field (internal, external) as unsafe and adapt through isolation from Nature or codependency, for example. 
‚Äã
3. ACTIVATION (To Be Safely Mobilized). Mobilization of energy, stimulation, excitement, curiosity, play. 
‚Äã
4. REST (To Be Safely Deactivated). Relaxation, rejuvenation, rest, sleep, integration
‚Äã
Activation/Deactivation is the core cycle through which our nervous system regulates our inner life. When this cycle is disrupted, the nervous system engages more energy in self-protection.

Healing means the path of restoring and embodying these 4 core needs. 
‚Äã
Inside the book Embodied Healing, I offer many trauma and nervous system-informed frameworks and insights to address these 4 needs and build a sustainable healing momentum. Link in bio to get your copy.

Ally. ‚Äã

A 6-year-old boy in Chicago was stabbed to death by his own landlord who also attacked his mother. According to the sheriff‚Äôs office, the man slaughtered the child because he was Muslim.  A statement by the sheriff says they were ‚Äútargeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.‚Äù

The young boy, whose name I am not using, and his mother were both stabbed many many times.  The DOJ says they are investigating this as a hate crime. The suspect, who is 76, is charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of a hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

If you are threatened or see anti-Muslim hate you can report it.

instagram,"Amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to show solidarity with the Palestinian people saying the Palestine issue is not just of Muslims alone, it is a humanitarian issue and it is a matter of all those who want justice.

Addressing a gathering here on Saturday night, the Hyderabad MP citing media reports said the ‚Äúzaalim‚Äù Israeli government has bombarded Gaza with 6,000 bombs in the last six days due to which over 1,500 Palestinian people including children and women were killed and several thousands are injured.

Ethnic cleansing in Gaza: Owaisi
He alleged that whatever is happening in Gaza is ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù and wanted the Indian government and the country to condemn ‚Äúthe war crimes‚Äù Israel is doing.

Owaisi said he stands with Palestine and will continue to do so, adding the poor people of Gaza, with a population of 21 lakh, 10 lakh have been rendered homeless.

He alleged the ‚Äúzaalim‚Äù Israeli government wants all people of Gaza to be removed and the world which talks of human rights is silent today.

‚ÄòIsrael has been the occupier for 70 years‚Äô
Owaisi said for 70 years Israel has been the ‚Äúoccupier‚Äù and Palestine has been occupied territory. ‚ÄúYou cannot see the occupation, you cannot see the cruelty‚Ä¶We condemn violence whoever does it. This is ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people. Cruelty is being done on the people of Gaza. America, Britain, Europe have become mute spectators today,‚Äù Owaisi said.

Owaisi said ‚ÄúWe would like to tell our Prime Minister‚Ä¶Modi ji stop the atrocities being committed against the Palestinians in Gaza‚Ä¶show solidarity with Palestine people. 10 lakh people out of the 21 lakh have been rendered homeless. That Netanyahu (Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu) is a devil, he is a war criminal. Houses are being destroyed and 6,000 bombs were used‚Äù.

Your reasons for misunderstanding makes sense. Misunderstandings aren‚Äôt random. They‚Äôre related to real events from the past (childhood, former relationships, or events in you current relationship) that have given you good reason to jump to conclusions. Our brains are wired to jump to conclusions for the sake of efficiency and staying safe. At the same time, partners who are trying to do better and grow can get boxed in by misunderstandings, and everyone feels demoralized and stuck. What‚Äôs the solution? Curiosity.

instagram,"The father of rap star #Drake is speaking out against backlash his son has been receiving.

After the musician was slammed recently for not taking a stance on the devastating war happening in Gaza, #DennisGraham explained why he thinks Drake made that choice.

Reportedly, the celebrity dad stated when asked about the topic:

‚ÄúIf you say something about this one you‚Äôre going to get criticized, right, and if you say something about someone else you‚Äôre going to get [criticized]‚Ä¶So stay out of it, you know, like especially if you‚Äôre somebody that‚Äôs well known.‚Äù

Adding:

‚ÄúBeing a celebrity and [saying] something favoring one against the other and it‚Äôs going to come back on you,‚Äù

Dennis Graham‚Äôs comments come days after culture commentator #DJVlad called out Drake and #DJKhaled for failing to use their platforms to speak on the war. In case you‚Äôre unfamiliar, an alleged terrorist group called the Hamas reportedly launched a missile attack on the citizens of Israel last week, sparking a full on war on the Gaza strip between the #Israelis and #Palestines. As we covered, pop star #BrunoMars had to cancel two appearances in the Middle East due to having to immediately evacuate because of the conflict.

The situation has caused many celebrities to speak for or against one side or the other, which is why DJ Vlad took issue with the silence of Drake, who is of Jewish decent, and DJ Khaled, who is of Palestinian descent. 

He wrote on X (formerly Twitter):

‚ÄúHas anyone noticed that the most famous Jewish person on Earth, Drake, and the most famous Palestinian person on Earth, DJ Khaled, haven‚Äôt said a single thing about the Gaza-Israel conflict? It‚Äôs not like Drake is too busy. He‚Äôs been writing paragraphs about Joe Budden hurting his feelings about his new album. DJ Khaled has been working overtime promoting his new Jordan sneakers.

instagram,"In the midst of the ongoing ethnic conflict between Meiteis and Kukis, disturbing posters have emerged in Moirang town, Manipur, urging Kukis to 'go back to Israel.' This development follows reports that over 200 Kuki fighters, rooted in Manipur and Mizoram, are set to join Israel's Defence Force (IDF) in their fight against Hamas in Palestine.

Of the 3,60,000 reserve soldiers in IDF, 206 belong to the Kuki community, who initially migrated to Israel under the country's open-door policy for 'lost Jewish tribes.' Presently, around 5,000 Kukis reside in Israel, with most living in Sderot, a city near Gaza, facing the brunt of recent violence. The Bnei Menashe, as this community is known in Hebrew, witnessed their homes affected, with one family's house burned. 

In Aizawl, prayer services have been held for those who lost their lives in Israel, expressing pride in their community members fighting for the IDF. A viral video features a middle-aged man from Manipur's Churachandpur district, dressed in military attire and armed, pledging to defend his homeland against enemy attacks. .

Regrettably, the ethnic tensions in Manipur have resulted in at least 170 casualties and the displacement of thousands since May this year. The clash between Meitei and Kuki groups further complicates the already sensitive situation.  As India closely watches the IDF's actions in Gaza, the Kuki community's unique connection to the conflict underscores the complexity of interconnection of global and local issues. The posters demanding Kukis to 'go back to Israel' have heightened tensions in the region.

‚Å†
There are families like this out there, and the parents model:‚Å†
‚Å†
*Conflict resolution between siblings‚Å†
*Good communication around everything from boundaries to logistics‚Å†
*Healthy intimacy and mutual respect between parents‚Å†
*Empathy and understanding during bumps‚Å†
‚Å†
A toxic family system for lack of resources and willingness to use them if present will engage in the following:‚Å†
‚Å†
*Distracting from more significant family issues by scapegoating a member‚Å†
*Cultivates contempt vs. empathy and respect‚Å†
*Minimizes unfair issues, and conflict due to emotional laziness (cowardice)‚Å†
*Conditions members to believe that conflict is selfish, and we are left to believe it isn't worth it (because it isn't growing up)‚Å†
*Believes that not bringing issues up is a morally good thing‚Å†
‚Å†
As we grow and heal from childhood trauma, we need to try to have faith in healthy conflict while finishing business with our family's toxicity around intimacy, respect, and connection.‚Å†

instagram,"Wadea al Fayoume, a Palestinian-American, died in hospital after being stabbed 26 times with a ""military-style knife"" on Saturday, the Will County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

His 32-year-old mother is recovering in hospital after suffering ""over a dozen stab wounds"".

Police said they were able to determine that both victims were ""targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and Israelis"".

Joseph M Czuba, 71, has been charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

Wadea and his mother were found in a bedroom inside a property in the Plainfield Township, that Czuba had been renting to them.

Wadea's mother had called police to report that her landlord had attacked her with a knife, police said. She said on the phone that she had run into a bathroom and continued to fight him off.

While the relationship between Israel and Palestine has complexities. What is not complex is that acts of terror are evil. What is not complex is antisemitism is racism.

Our hearts are also broken for innocent civilians who are stuck under the rule of a terrorist regime in Palestine and now are stuck in the terrible dangers of war. Just as we can never dehumanize the Jewish people, we must never dehumanize the Palestinian people, either. 
¬†
Men, women, and children have been killed on both sides. These families have faced atrocity and are waking up without their loved ones. The reality of war is horrific, and we must pray for a quick and miraculous end to the violence. 
¬†
We believe Israel has the right to exist and defend itself. We are extending our prayers and empathy for Israel and innocent Palestinians.

Furthermore, we must not forget the Church in both Israel and Palestine. We must pray for their strengthening and protection and that many would find Jesus in this time of trouble.

The Israel-Hamas war has unleashed a wave of antisemitism in Europe, with an uptick in threats and insults targeting Jews in Germany, France, Italy and the UK. ‚Å†

The French interior minister said there have been 189 threats and 65 arrests for antisemitism in the country, which has the biggest Jewish community after Israel and the US and a large Muslim population. ‚Å†

instagram,"A six-year-old Palestinian American boy was stabbed to death in Chicago by his landlord shouting ‚ÄúYou Muslims must die‚Äù in an alleged response to the war between Israel and Gaza.

The boy, who was pronounced dead at the hospital, was stabbed 26 times with a large military-style knife. His mom Hanaan was stabbed as well and is in critical condition.

Officers found both victims on Saturday morning at a home in southwest of Chicago.

Police have charged the 71-year-old man with murder and hate crime. Police charged him with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crimes and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office in suburban Chicago said in a statement on Sunday.

‚ÄúWe are shocked and disturbed to learn that a landlord in Chicago expressing anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian views broke into a Muslim family‚Äôs apartment and attacked them with a knife, injuring the mother and killing her 6-year-old son, Wadea Al-Fayoume,‚Äù Council of American Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in a statement.

instagram,"Our wounded parts want to hold onto small things and use them as proof that we're not lovable, not good enough, that our partners are out to get us. A big part of learning to be happy in relationship is noticing when our ego wants to indulge in our story of brokenness and choosing to let go instead.

What do I mean by ""indulging in a story of brokenness""? When we've been wounded, our ego builds an identity around it.

We may not even realize that we're carrying around stories of being unworthy or unlovable, or that we unconsciously feel drawn to friction, tension, or drama in relationship.

I see Conscious Relationship as the practice of learning to cultivate, harness and carefully direct our energy in a positive direction.

When we're wired to fight, defend, poke and prod or fall into self-pity - it actually takes a lot of energetic practice to let go in the moments where we're feeling activated and have an opportunity to feed the story.

Many of us say we want harmony, but actually we quite enjoy conflict on some level and we're not being honest with ourselves about that.

Maybe what we really enjoy is just the energy - the intensity of feeling or the attention we're receiving. And so we get to ask ourselves - is this how I want to use my energy?

Do I need to respond to the thing my partner just said or did with more fire? Do I want to spend my energy on arguing, being right, proving a point, or can I channel this energy back into my heart and express myself in a way that will create an opportunity to deepen in love?

Choosing peace isn't as simple as saying we want it. Choosing peace is a life-long practice of self-observation, dancing with energy and choosing where to put it.

Taking deep breaths, Seeing our partners heart, Responding with a loving statement rather than being defensive (even when you're annoyed), or simply finding a tree to admire ... are all ways to ground into the present moment and realize that life is too precious to spend wasting our energy away on things that don't matter.

instagram,"Ramses II, one of ancient Egypt's most illustrious kings, left an indelible mark on history through his reign, which lasted for 66 years, and his impressive accomplishments. Known as Ramses the Great, his legacy remains a testament to the grandeur of the Egyptian civilization.

Ramses II ascended to the throne in 1279 BC, inheriting a kingdom deeply rooted in tradition. Throughout his rule, he sought to not only maintain Egypt's prestige but also expand its borders. One of his most significant achievements was the signing of the first-ever known peace treaty with the Hittites, marking the end of a long-standing conflict.

This era was also marked by extensive construction projects. Perhaps the most famous of these is the grand temple complex of Abu Simbel, carved into the cliffs along the Nile. The colossal statues of Ramses II, standing guard at the entrance, stand as a testament to his might and architectural vision.

Ramses II's reign was marked by prolific building endeavors, including the construction of the iconic Luxor Temple, Karnak Temple, and the Ramesseum. His monuments not only served as a reminder of his power but also as places of worship and veneration for generations to come.

Beyond his military and architectural achievements, Ramses II was a prolific writer, leaving behind a wealth of inscriptions and texts. His military campaigns and diplomatic efforts are meticulously documented, providing invaluable insights into the ancient world.

Even in death, Ramses II's legacy endures. His mummified remains, discovered in the 19th century, continue to be a subject of fascination and scientific study. The intricate preservation of his body, along with the opulent treasures found in his tomb, emphasize the importance he placed on the afterlife.

Ramses the Great's reign was an epoch of grandeur, diplomacy, and construction, forever etching his name into the annals of history. His legacy stands as a symbol of the magnificence of ancient Egypt, inspiring wonder and admiration across the ages.",,4737,"{'like_count': 4721, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 594388}",Egyptology,,2023-10-16 05:22:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/363836356_984623969322383_2917952889907504925_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SyI0xkWqGYkAX_2qQAN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAOEcY47jsnX9Ubcbrsb37Yrps4DMwS7nAK9BF3WtU1rQ&oe=6559AA65,https://www.instagram.com/p/CycqNmwq0zh/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392719590_883527313274101_4873098500717138123_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=yC7H1NeuaOIAX_JL3nT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA0jx89s9WBoKuXTkMGcxJr5ZDxJ31dP_AdEJ7pqZa4iA&oe=654E0E13
instagram,"An Illinois man has been charged with hate crimes for stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy to death and wounding his mother in an attack targeting them for their religion and as a response to the Middle Eastern conflict between Israel and Hamas. 

The boy was stabbed 26 times with a military-style knife, while the 32-year-old woman suffered multiple stab wounds. US President Joe Biden criticized the attack, stating that, ""This horrific act of hate has no place in America."" 

The suspect, Joseph Czuba, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Both victims were targeted due to their Muslim beliefs and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict.

instagram,"""I wish children didn't die. I wish they would be temporarily elevated to the skies until the war ends. Then they would return home safe, and when their parents would ask them: ""where were you?"", they would say: ""we were playing in the clouds"".

‚Äî Ghassan Kanafani

9 out of 10 children in Gaza suffer from some form of conflict related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and because they're subjugated to constant harrowing violence and terrorized by Israel every day, it can't even be classified as *post*‚Äî it's just continuous trauma.

""I miss them to death but I cannot look at the sea....Now we just sit and remember what happened and what we used to be.""

This isn't how any child should have to live life or think. May we never forget them. They are us and we are them.

More than 1,030 Palestinian children in Gaza have been killed by Israeli forces since October 7, which is about one child every 15 minutes. This operation by the occupying forces began with the story that resistance fighters head beheaded 40 settler children. And now 1030 children have been massacred upon a misleading, completely fabricated pretense who will never come back. 1030 children whose already waning futures were forever stolen, choked in clouds of white phosphorus; 1030 chances of infinite possibilities forever trapped under all that rubble. Children in Gaza are writing their names on their palms as you read this in order to be recognized once the missiles strike their homes.

And as if that wasn't enough, on Saturday in Chicago, a man openly expressing Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian sentiments broke into a Muslim family's apartment and attacked them with a knife, injuring the mother and killing her 6-year-old son, Wadea Al-Fayoume by stabbing him 26 times. And just as they fabricated lies to fuel hysteria and hatred against Palestinians by vilifying and dehumanizing them as terrorists for an entire week, now the western media are framing his death by completely dissociating it from that context of vile bigotry and violence which they began with.",,4414,"{'like_count': 4391, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 23569}",Dialectic | ÿ≠ŸäÿØÿ±,,2023-10-16 20:57:49,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/343420991_1437621160391879_3856372823849496834_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=q7WC83TaKIAAX85F_d2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCrcRWoSVj80jKywYeFaj7cVj1sh7fCJXX-Ppup1iO9SQ&oe=655A1E6B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyeVOESIqww/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391478812_1470707276831285_839727766721381132_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Fu73fXxPPJMAX9vcccR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB_AMAZ9JZM-LYOsDX5PwyYuUEnPt6KmaSrixT2h2A6XQ&oe=655A90AF

instagram,"Tetu Member of Parliament Geoffrey Wandeto has raised anxiety about the Israel-Palestine conflict potentially impacting fuel prices. 

He noted that the ongoing fighting between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas could cause further spikes in oil prices. 

This, according to him, is particularly worrying as fuel prices have already been surging in Kenya.

During an appearance on Citizen TV's Daybreak show, Wandeto explained that the outcome of the conflict in the coming weeks could significantly pressure global oil production. 

He emphasized that a prolonged Israel-Hamas conflict might drive oil prices beyond what Kenya can comfortably manage.

‚ÄúWe cannot downplay the new conflict between Israel and Palestine that has a significant impact on fuel prices,‚Äù he said.

Furthermore, Wandeto suggested that increasing exports could help alleviate Kenya's dollar shortage, which has been affecting the country due to various factors, including a decline in exports. 

He proposed the idea of exploring alternative settlement currencies for global trade and encouraging trading within East Africa using local currencies as a potential solution.

‚ÄúThis whole dollar thing is not just a Kenyan thing. I read that Japan, which is a very strong economy, has less than 20% or so devaluation of their currency. Almost all countries in the world are hurting because what is happening in America is that they are trying to cool their economy from inflation,‚Äù he said.

He added: ‚ÄúNow we are all victims of whatever goes on in America. When America coughs, the whole world catches a cold.‚Äù

Wandeto also pointed out that the global demand for oil products is increasing due to the rebound of the Chinese economy. 

This, combined with fears that the Israel-Hamas conflict could spread to the petroleum-producing Gulf region, has led to rising oil price",,4227,"{'like_count': 3983, 'comment_count': 244, 'num_users': 2019900}",Citizen TV Kenya,,2023-10-16 08:54:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/357516290_3469995009932234_8834558106815085581_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=wBye34ec74gAX-Gx4Yr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBIa2bBl1Kb7CwpaTNdHZkEW4soNdHqoTz2KPo80Di82A&oe=655B9735,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydCZvSgDe7/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/358347919_2066838573680895_5146956678391168753_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=i78iP876NP0AX_cm_x9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBs-4UDEiXxSDc4eJmdIeXmSCm7pTW4_WyLE_0hffZ78w&oe=6531ADDC

In a decades-long oppression that continually affects millions within Palestine and amongst the diaspora of its people, Palestinians have struggled to have their voice heard through traditional media outlets.
Determined to speak out and break the silence, over the years, Arab and Palestinian artists have found a way to discuss the conflict's complexity through music, by voicing their daily struggles, their dreams of a brighter future, and the surreal experiences of living with war and occupation.

In this list, we've compiled songs that take us through the history of Palestinian resistance music, where artists and poets address specific moments of the conflict, dealing with their grief and frustration, and painting a more well-rounded picture of how Palestinians feel about the extraordinary circumstances they have been put through along the years.

instagram,"Yesterday, The New York Times reported that the Israeli ground invasion, initially scheduled for this weekend, was postponed for a few days due to bad weather. Experts however think Israel's expected all-out ground assault on Gaza has been postponed out of fears it could escalate into a regionwide war. 

After a day of escalating strikes around the Israeli-Lebanese border, which could escalate into a full-scale war with Lebanon-based Hezbollah, there‚Äôs fear the violence will spread to other parts of the region.

And last night, Iran warned Israel once again that if it escalates the conflict in Gaza it risks drawing in the involvement of Iran's military. If Iran enters the Israel-Hamas War, there's a risk Syria will get dragged into the war as well, completely setting ablaze a region that is already one of the most explosive ones in the world. 

Earlier, on Saturday, the Pentagon ordered a second carrier strike group (lead by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower) to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and is sending Air Force fighter jets to the region as Israel prepares to expand its Gaza operations. The first US Navy carrier strike group (led by the USS Gerald R. Ford) that was sent to the region, arrived off the coast of Israel last week. The US warships are not intended to join the fighting in Gaza or take part in Israel‚Äôs operations, but the presence of two of the US Navy‚Äôs most powerful vessels is designed to send a message of deterrence to Iran and Iranian proxies in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. 

Meanwhile, US Air Forces Central Command on Saturday announced the deployment of F-15E fighter jets and A-10 ground-attack jets to an air base in Jordan to further bolster the U.S. defense posture in the region as part of the effort to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel. If deterrence however fails, the U.S. could be forced to enter the war as well.

At the start one of the most tensed weeks in years, future.weapons takes a closer look at the major players in the escalating violence between Hamas and Israel.

instagram,"Singapore is deeply distressed by the increasing civilian casualty toll and deepening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. These arise from Israeli military operations in response to the attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October 2023.

Hamas deliberately targeted civilians, murdering and kidnapping them, and perpetrating abhorrent acts of terror. These atrocities cannot be justified by any rationale. We call for the immediate and safe release of all civilians taken hostage by Hamas.

Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory. However, in exercising this right Israel must comply with international law, including the laws of war. It must do its utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians.

We urge all parties to abide by international humanitarian law and allow for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip. 

In response to the urgent humanitarian situation, the Singapore Government will contribute S$300,000 towards humanitarian relief operations through the Singapore Red Cross. 

Tragically, too many lives on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been lost in repeated cycles of violence over many decades. Singapore has long held the position that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive resolution to the longstanding conflict is a negotiated two-state solution consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. It is convinced that this remains the case. It urges both sides to take steps towards this ultimate goal, despite the recent and ongoing hostilities and the difficulty of the task.

Speaking at the Dewan Rakyat, Anwar stressed that sending troops overseas is not a ‚Äúsimple decision‚Äù for the government to take.

He said should the need arise, Malaysia will make a collective decision with its allies and neighbours to do ‚Äúwhatever is necessary‚Äù to help Palestinians in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

instagram,"Israel‚Äôs war on Palestine in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank has reached its second week, as a continuation of the war on occupied Palestine that has been looming over the nation for decades in modern human history. Israel has told 1.1 million Gazans, with half a population of women and children to flee from their indigenous land as Israel continues its air invasions, and carpet bombings reducing the city of Gaza to rubble.
Commentators, political pundits, world leaders, human rights organisations, left or right side of the spectrum, bystanders etc all took to social media to put forward their opinions on Isreal and Hamas conflict. Indian press pacing up with the international press also reported on Israel‚Äôs war on Palestine. Ground analysis and reporting, as well as studio commentary, exacerbated the confusion, deception, and warmongering that the Indian media performed for TRPs (television rating points) and gimmicks.

Iran told the UN that it does not want to see Israel‚Äôs conflict with Hamas escalate into a wider regional war, according to diplomatic sources.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian met with UN envoy to the Middle East Tor Wennesland on Saturday in Beirut, the two diplomatic sources said. Wennesland urged Amir-Abdollahian to help prevent a spillover of the conflict in Gaza and Israel to the wider region in the Middle East.

The Iranian foreign minister replied that Iran doesn‚Äôt want the conflict to turn into a regional war and wants to try to help with the release of civilians who are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.

But Amir-Abdollahian stressed that Iran has its red lines. He said that if the Israeli military operation continues ‚Äî and especially if Israel follows through on its promise of a ground offensive in Gaza ‚Äî Iran will have to respond, according to the sources.",,2892,"{'like_count': 2097, 'comment_count': 795, 'num_users': 259745}",Mindsetofthetruth,,2023-10-16 09:57:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/363872250_631307132305954_8043861386779767334_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=QpiI3gSGCOsAX9Une5T&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDjcFeq1kT3bGZAjf8Z77yAoh1ET3emubPOK6ztpmieDw&oe=655AE61B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydJpCRoVWu/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392736357_837612244507910_6633718019181767603_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KkpDDqd3QpYAX_aUonW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBGVY9ehPwSloDC41j4D1XrxlQ8DE_WtiL0PGVVoSwG4g&oe=653CB13F

Probably the number one thing I‚Äôm most proud of in my life is my marriage with Cass. We have been so intentional and always willing to put in the hard work to build the foundation for a truly epic love. Now 5+ years together and 2 years married we get to see the fruit of our efforts more and more everyday. ü´∂üèª

Our top 3 tips for building an epic marriage üëáüèª

1) Choose a partner who you trust to be your mirror. Marriage is a lot of feedback, and learning how to put down your own defenses and grow together. I don‚Äôt always like it when Cass points out something I may need to change in myself but ultimately I trust them and have always been better for it ‚ú®

2) Don‚Äôt be afraid to get some third party help. Marriage is SO much communication and blending communication styles. If there are some hurdles you are encountering in blending those styles a couples therapist is an amazing tool. We like to touch base with ours when we aren‚Äôt in conflict so we can build tools to keep it that way üí™üèª

instagram,"New Delhi: A six-year-old Muslim boy and his 32-year-old mother were attacked with a knife by their 71-year-old landlord in Illinois, US, in a hate crime reportedly triggered by the conflict in Israel and Palestine. The boy, Wadea al-Fayoume, lost his life. His mother, Hanaan Shahin, a Palestinian who moved from the West Bank to the US 12 years ago, has multiple stab wounds and is in the hospital, BBC reported.

The accused, Joseph Czuba, has been charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, hate crimes and aggravated battery.

The attack reportedly took place on Saturday (October 14). In a statement on Sunday, the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said they had received an emergency call from Shahin (though the statement did not name her), who said she was being attacked by her landlord in Plainfield, near Chicago.

‚ÄúThe knife used in this attack is a 12-inch (31cm) serrated military style knife that has a seven-inch blade,‚Äù the Sheriff‚Äôs office said.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs statement said.

Wadea was reportedly stabbed 26 times. He was declared dead when he was taken to the hospital, AP reported.

However, on Sunday a different pattern emerged amidst heightened tensions between Israel and Lebanon.

instagram,"Allow me a humble recommendation. 
Phyllis Bennis did an excellent and clarifying radio interview today about the present horrific situation in Gaza and Israel, outlining it with clarity, but most importantly, putting it in historical context - the only way to begin to grasp the horror we are witnessing. I highly recommend it to English speaking friends here. The link is on my bio. Bennis is a 72 year old Jewish-American writer and activist, a specialist in Middle Eastern politics and in the UN. She wrote the book pictured here, which I also highly recommend to anyone interested in understanding the history of the conflict - and I think we all should be. There are many books on it of course, and I‚Äôm no scholar; this is simply one that is straight forward. It gave me clarity on the matter back in 2015, and it is very relevant now. She also wrote an important article for The Hill on October 8th, one that sent me back to her work, and that I urge you to read now. 
Misinformation is a key weapon in any war, this situation is no exception. Credible information is key to containing heightened emotions, which are understandable in the face of horror.
 I humbly hope this is useful to some of you, as it was to me, and that perspective can help us all towards peace.",,2639,"{'like_count': 2563, 'comment_count': 76, 'num_users': 171743}",Rodrigo Amarante,,2023-10-16 18:29:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/188161809_492320715517348_3392663410055026039_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=05YOpi7ZI_0AX8VplV4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBCM3T6XpVvJ_Wy5egq6SG9Yq8dWpRCnd8by-mlNLUb7A&oe=655A4732,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyeERO9pd3j/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393162339_1895172344211328_8855145125840764334_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Z4hwQFwL2zwAX-sIeK_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCFm5tBcriwLJz2cs1MXI9pmn_yxgF8knvDl98Ojj0F3g&oe=655B0B95

Families of those captured or missing because of Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel are experiencing the unbearable anguish of being in the middle of the world‚Äôs most complicated hostage crisis in recent memory.

On Monday, the number of publicly known hostages increased to almost 200, up from the 150 that had been spoken of since the beginning of the conflict. Experts say that Hamas has most likely locked them up in a warren of underground tunnels in the Gaza Strip, as the Israeli Air Force bombards the territory and the army prepares to invade.

instagram,"Complaint filed against Rizwan in India for offering prayer on the field. 

A complaint has been filed by an Indian lawyer with the International Cricket Council against Mohammad Rizwan for offering prayer on the field and¬†dedicating Pakistan‚Äôs victory over Sri Lanka to the people of Gaza,¬†Times Now¬†reported.

Rizwan scored a¬†match-winning century against Sri Lanka, which he dedicated to the people of Gaza in light of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.

Vineet Jindal, an advocate of Supreme Court of India lodged a complaint with the ICC against the Pakistani cricketer.

‚ÄúThis is a complaint about Pakistan Cricket Player, Mohammad Rizwan, who was seen offering namaz on the cricket field during his team‚Äôs opening match of the ongoing ICC Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup 2023 on Friday (October 6) against the Netherlands in Hyderabad,‚Äù the complaint read.

Jindal went on to add that Rizwan offering prayer on the cricket field amid many Indians was symbolic of the intentional depiction of his religion which stands against the spirit of the game.

‚ÄúThis very act of the player raises questions about the spirit of the match and raises a question of the ideology, the player follows while playing the match. The act of displaying his religion by Mohammed Rizwan purposefully depicts his intent to message that he is a Muslim, defeating the spirit of sports,‚Äù he said.

Rizwan¬†was seen offering prayers amid the field while his teammates were waiting for the drinks during the break, he added.

For him, the Pakistani wicket-keeping batter‚Äôs statement in his press conference regarding the dedication of his victory to the people of Gaza further attested to his religious and political ideology.",,2395,"{'like_count': 2347, 'comment_count': 48, 'num_users': 90105}",Kashmir Update üïØ (OFFICIAL),,2023-10-16 08:16:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/244411116_158600153059680_7777580929038407350_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=BF_P37mbsTEAX9w3v9Q&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDmgswQDb3RTMbn9yHaWSsutMBVSSEvav6nUQeU4CUTDg&oe=655AB15C,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyc-E0TvLce/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392954731_155149054292287_7974424839393239461_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=S9JFL6mfdmwAX_70G8w&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDofMPDdb1iQ6na0drxTbM9ZzcXPt89PEVPbGMUWyc42g&oe=653298E3

instagram,"An Illinois man was charged with hate crimes for stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy to death and wounding his mother in an attack that targeted them for their religion and as a response to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, officials and Muslim rights activists said on Sunday.

The boy was stabbed 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch (18-cm) serrated blade, the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said in a statement.

The 32-year-old woman had multiple stab wounds and is expected to survive the attack that occurred on Saturday in Plainfield Township, about 64 kilometres (40 miles) southwest of Chicago.

US President Joe Biden said the boy‚Äôs family were Palestinian Muslims who ‚Äúcame to America seeking what we all seek ‚Äî a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis horrific act of hate has no place in America,‚Äù Biden said in a statement.

instagram,"Hopes for a brief ceasefire in southern Gaza to allow foreign passport holders to leave the besieged Palestinian enclave and aid to be brought in were dashed on Monday, with Israeli bombardments intensifying ahead of an expected ground invasion.

Residents of Gaza said the overnight strikes were the heaviest yet in nine days of conflict. Many houses were flattened and the death toll rose inexorably, they said.
Diplomatic efforts have been underway to get aid into the enclave, which has endured unrelenting Israeli bombing since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that killed 1,300 people - the bloodiest single day in the state's 75-year history.

Israel has imposed a full blockade and is preparing a ground invasion to enter Gaza and destroy Hamas, which has continued to fire rockets at Israel since its brief cross-border assault. Israeli troops and tanks are already massed on the border.
Authorities in Gaza said at least 2,750 people had so far been killed by the Israeli strikes, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. A further 1,000 people were missing and believed to be under rubble.

instagram,"Which adult attachment style (or mix) likely applies to you?üëá

The attachment between a child and a parent is very important. It leads to the development of an attachment style. Any issues with this bond can lead to a trauma in later years, well into adulthood.

Psychologists believe that the attachment style developed by a child can have an effect when the child grows to be an adult themselves. While mixes of attachment styles are possible and the attachment style can change a bit, it is seen that a non-secure attachment style more often leads to dysfunctional relationships and divorce.

The four adult attachment styles have the same names as the childhood ones, but the effects are a bit different as it focuses on how the person deals with the attachment to their partner. A secure attached person feels balanced in relationships and can communicate their needs. They can feel sad, but when their partner is away they can fend for themselves.

People with anxious attachment styles often derive their self-worth from relationships. They need reassurance and constant attention. However, if a person has an avoidant attachment style they withdraw from their partner, have difficulty with intimate relationships and avoids emotions. Lastly, people with disorganised attachment style experience extreme emotional highs and lows, often suffer from substance abuse and avoid responsibility in relationships.

The All Out For Gaza Emergency Protest took place today in downtown Saint Louis. The gathering location was Kiener Plaza, and it attracted several hundred supporters who showed up in full force to stand in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

When VOP asked Jeenin Mahmoud, a supporter why she felt compelled to attend the protest, she replied, ""I am Palestinian myself, so it's only right to do so. That's the least I could do since I am not there. Besides the guilt I am feeling, I wanted to be their voice. What the media is showing is nothing compared to what's actually going on.

Another supporter stated, ""The events unfolding in front of our eyes are a humanitarian crisis, a genocide, and a war crime. 53% of Gaza's population consists of children. Israel's actions of cutting off water, food, and electricity are considered war crimes. It's crucial for more people to understand that what is happening in Palestine is not a 'conflict' or a 'war.' It's ethnic cleansing.""

instagram,"On October 7, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that governs Gaza, launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing over 1,400 civilians. 

Shortly after, Israel‚Äôs military launched air strikes in retaliation, and in the days since, the Israeli government also cut supplies to Gaza, including food, fuel, water, and electricity. Meanwhile, homes and businesses are running low on fuel. Hospitals are expected to be out of fuel entirely in the next 24 hours, leaving thousands of patients‚Äô lives at risk.

Tensions reached a fever pitch when, later in the week, the Israeli state ordered over 1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza evacuate. The United Nations declared the evacuation order impossible, and warned it would only result in ""devastating humanitarian consequences,‚Äù while the World Health Organization called it a ‚Äúdeath sentence.‚Äù

Over 2,700 people have been killed by Israel's bombing of Gaza, with an estimated 1,000 MORE missing under rubble, reports the BBC. This period of conflict is only the most recent in over seven decades of occupation in Palestine, and oppression faced by the Palestinian people.

The UN has said that, due to the ongoing conflict, the Middle East is on ‚Äúon the verge of the abyss,‚Äù and is requesting Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.

instagram,"Israel has no interest in widening the current conflict, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said.
Gallant was speaking against the background of an exchange of fire across the country‚Äôs northern border with Lebanon.

Speaking to Israeli troops on the edge of the Gaza Strip, Gallant said: ‚ÄúWe do not want any escalation of the situation.‚Äù

Gallant made direct reference to the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia active in southern Lebanon.

‚ÄúIf Hezbollah opts for war, they will pay a very high price,‚Äù he warned.

‚ÄúBut if they restrain themselves, we will respect that and keep the situation as it is,‚Äù he added.

Turning to the expected ground offensive by Israeli troops deployed around the Gaza Strip, Gallant said that Israel had a job to do.

The war in Gaza would be intensive, deadly, and precise, he said, adding: ‚ÄúAnd it will change the situation forever,‚Äù he predicted.

Meanwhile, one week after the start of the latest conflict, the number of dead in the Gaza Strip has risen to 2,450, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Sunday.

Around 9,200 others were injured in the territory, which is under the control of Hamas, it said.

This means that the number of reported dead on the Palestinian side in just over a week is already higher than during the Gaza war in 2014, when 2,250 people died in the coastal strip within 50 days.

At that time, 66 Israeli soldiers and five civilians were also killed.

The new conflict is thus also the confrontation with the most deaths since Hamas violently took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007.

Hamas massacred Israeli civilians in border towns and at a music festival on Oct. 7.

It was the worst bloodbath in Israeli history.

So far, more than 1,300 people have died in Israel, including 286 servicemen and women.

Israel responded with massive airstrikes on targets in the densely populated coastal strip.

Cecilia James is a music journalist and loves the meaning of songs and lyrics. When she finds a clue that leads to the muse of one of the most popular and secretive love songs ever made, she begins investigating. ‚Å£

I loved the idea of this story! I especially love how it‚Äôs modeled on the song Hey There Delilah, which every young woman in the world wishes was about her in the mid 2000‚Äôs! While the romance itself didn‚Äôt catch me from the beginning, the forbiddeness and conflict was very well done. I loved the investigative part of the story more than the back history, which is unusual for me. It all came together well. ‚Å£

instagram,"Health officials in Gaza are grappling with a grim reality as they run out of space for bodies in the wake of Israeli air strikes. As a result, they are using ice cream trucks as temporary morgues. Gaza has been hit by Israeli air strikes in recent weeks in retaliation for a terrorist attack by Hamas. Hospitals and morgues are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties, and with the hospital morgues limited in capacity, unconventional measures have become necessary. Ice cream trucks are now being used to store the deceased due to the risk associated with moving bodies to hospitals.

""The hospital morgue can only take 10 bodies, so we have brought in ice cream freezers from the ice cream factories in order to store the huge numbers of martyrs,"" says Dr. Yasser Ali from the Shuhada Al-Aqsa hospital. However, even these additional freezers are insufficient to handle the overwhelming number of casualties, forcing some bodies to be stored in tents. The situation is dire, with a substantial death toll and limited resources to manage it.

This devastating scenario highlights the severity of the ongoing conflict, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The Israeli Air Force has launched thousands of bombings in response to the recent terrorist attacks, and the situation shows no sign of immediate resolution. It's a deeply tragic situation that underscores the human cost of these hostilities and the significant challenges faced by health officials on the ground.

instagram,"Their game remains the same. The only things that change is are the teams pitted against each other, the ball used and the scale at which that game is ‚Äúplayed‚Äù.

Almost every major conflict, if not every major conflict, has come from a division created from the topic of race or religion.

It‚Äôs what gets people to become emotionally charged and react more than anything else.

They know this and they exploit it. 

This current conflict is no different. 

2 nations (religions) that have been at war with each other longer than almost any other, both of which have also committed horrific crimes against each other‚Ä¶ Now have the light shined directly on them after the fire between them was stoked by outside parties interested in ONE thing ‚Äî Distract and divide society, create enough chaos and carnage to get society to react to it and ultimately find a reason for us to enter another war, launder billions, sacrifice countless innocent lives and further control the socio/political spectrum.

But all of this is only possible with one thing ‚Äî DIVISION.

The most fascinating thing is when on the timeline these conflicts usually pop up‚Ä¶

And even more fascinating is how so many people still fall for it and give them exactly what they want.

They weaponize our humanity against us because they have none and they pit us against eachother so that we never think of pointing our anger and our aggression toward them.

For as long as the stock market has existed (hundreds of years) it‚Äôs always been a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs along the way. But the overall trajectory over the long term has always been up! üìà

There‚Äôs always a new financial story or global conflict that causes stocks to crash down. But don‚Äôt let fear and uncertainty keep you from investing! As Warren Buffett once famously said; ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when they‚Äôre fearful.‚Äù

The stock market is one of the most resilient and proven wealth building mechanisms in the world. It‚Äôs made it through every war, economic crisis, natural disaster, and everything else ever thrown at it.

The trick is to stay consistent and hold long term, compounding will do the rest üìàüíØ

instagram,"(An edited excerpt from a letter by Dalia Hatuqa, a freelance journalist based in the West Bank)

My morning last Saturday began with a barrage of messages on my phone: Hamas had launched an operation and militants had broken through the fence that had kept Palestinians in Gaza under siege for 16 years.

I sent frantic WhatsApp messages to friends from Gaza who live in the West Bank: My neighbor Ola‚Äôs family fled their home. My friend Tahreer said five of her extended family were killed in Israeli shelling. Her friend Eman learned that her father, mother and brother had all died in an airstrike.

Across the street from my house, a charity had opened its doors overnight to house Gaza-based workers who had been expelled from Israel. As I helped my mother drop off clothes for the men, one stood out: He had just heard that his three children had been killed.

For many Palestinians in the West Bank, watching the scenes unfold has been mind-blowing, on a scale that shocks even those who have lived through decades of conflict. Gaza has been under blockade since 2007, when the Hamas movement took over after winning local elections. The Hamas attack was the first time that anyone had been able to break through the fence that kept Palestinians in the coastal enclave hemmed in.

Some have described the attack by Hamas as ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù which it is. Others say it is ‚Äúunprovoked,‚Äù but my Palestinian neighbors would beg to differ. They will tell you that over the last 16 years, Israel transformed the Gaza Strip into a pressure cooker, sealing it off from the outside world and decimating it repeatedly with military operations. The result is a grim wasteland with human development indicators like poverty and unemployment on par with the most desolate countries in the world, imposed by a government ostensibly responsible for their welfare.

Recent years have been marked by killings, home demolitions and displacement of entire communities, as documented by rights groups and U.N. agencies. As the amount of territory Palestinians control has shrunk, Palestinians have felt abandoned.

instagram,"Complaint filed against Rizwan in India for offering prayer on the field

A complaint has been filed by an Indian lawyer with the International Cricket Council against Mohammad Rizwan for offering prayer on the field and dedicating Pakistan‚Äôs victory over Sri Lanka to the people of Gaza, Times Now reported.

Rizwan scored a match-winning century against Sri Lanka, which he dedicated to the people of Gaza in light of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.

Vineet Jindal, an advocate of Supreme Court of India lodged a complaint with the ICC against the Pakistani cricketer.

‚ÄúThis is a complaint about Pakistan Cricket Player, Mohammad Rizwan, who was seen offering namaz on the cricket field during his team‚Äôs opening match of the ongoing ICC Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup 2023 on Friday (October 6) against the Netherlands in Hyderabad,‚Äù the complaint read.

Jindal went on to add that Rizwan offering prayer on the cricket field amid many Indians was symbolic of the intentional depiction of his religion which stands against the spirit of the game.

‚ÄúThis very act of the player raises questions about the spirit of the match and raises a question of the ideology, the player follows while playing the match. The act of displaying his religion by Mohammed Rizwan purposefully depicts his intent to message that he is a Muslim, defeating the spirit of sports,‚Äù he said.

Rizwan was seen offering prayers amid the field while his teammates were waiting for the drinks during the break, he added.

For him, the Pakistani wicket-keeping batter‚Äôs statement in his press conference regarding the dedication of his victory to the people of Gaza further attested to his religious and political ideology.

instagram,"(An edited excerpt from a letter by Dalia Hatuqa, a freelance journalist based in the West Bank)

My morning last Saturday began with a barrage of messages on my phone: Hamas had launched an operation and militants had broken through the fence that had kept Palestinians in Gaza under siege for 16 years.

I sent frantic WhatsApp messages to friends from Gaza who live in the West Bank: My neighbor Ola‚Äôs family fled their home. My friend Tahreer said five of her extended family were killed in Israeli shelling. Her friend Eman learned that her father, mother and brother had all died in an airstrike.

Across the street from my house, a charity had opened its doors overnight to house Gaza-based workers who had been expelled from Israel. As I helped my mother drop off clothes for the men, one stood out: He had just heard that his three children had been killed.

instagram,"Recently, I‚Äôve had a lot going on in my personal life including the passing of our sweet dog, May. So I‚Äôve avoided addressing the conflict in Gaza. 

Honestly, I didn‚Äôt know what to say because I didn‚Äôt have space for the pain. 

All I can say is that I‚Äôm sitting with my pain and heartbreak‚Ä¶.

Reflecting on how to integrate yoga‚Äôs spiritual teachings with my lived human experience, especially when there is so much suffering in the world. 

For me, a healthy, integrated spiritual life begins with acknowledging my pain, feeling my pain. Letting those emotions exist and move through me. 

Yoga is not an escape from reality, but a deep dive into it. 

It‚Äôs the hardest part of my practice - and maybe the most important. Otherwise I‚Äôm living in a fantasy of denial. 

Then I can work on finding more love and compassion for myself and for you. 

Spiritual bypassing happens when I avoid my negative or painful emotions in the name of spirituality. Or, when I use spiritual concepts like oneness or karma to avoid seeing the suffering of others. 

How do you avoid spiritual bypassing and still care for yourself during difficult times?

instagram,"National Assembly Deputy Speaker Gladys Shollei has opined that a fuss should not be made out of the office space conflict between Cabinet Secretaries Moses Kuria and Musalia Mudavadi.

This after the Head of Public Service Felix Koskei said on Sunday that the now expanded Prime CS position, which includes the Foreign and Diaspora Affairs docket, headed by Mudavadi, would be located at the old Treasury building on Harambee Avenue.

Meanwhile, the Public Service, Performance, and Delivery Management docket headed by Kuria would take up the Kenya Railways building off Haile Sellasie Avenue which created a point of contention.

The tiff saw Mudavadi's office disputing Koskei's remarks, inviting President William Ruto to the simmering conflict.

In Shollei's view, the matter should be considered a dead letter and should be dismissed since service delivery from the involved ministries will not be compromised.

""I think this is a non-issue really. I don't think it is something we should take our time discussing it. It's like discussing whether my daughter should sleep in the other room and my son should move to the other one and where my housekeeper should sleep,"" she said.

""It does not really matter at the end of the day it is the service to Kenyans that really matters. What has to be logically looked at is yet this is quite a significant change.""

Shollei, who was appearing on Citizen TV's Daybreak show on Monday, stated that it is also unreasonable to invite President Ruto's input on the minute issue, noting that a resolve can be made between the involved parties.

""That is something internal I think they can be able to sort it out. It is a bit ridiculous to tell the head of state to come and manage who sits where. I think he has more important things to deal with,"" she said.

instagram,"What happened: Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, issued a stern warning to Israel, calling for an immediate halt to its military operations in Gaza. He expressed grave concerns that the ongoing conflict could escalate to involve other parts of the Middle East, particularly if Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group, becomes engaged. Amirabdollahian emphasized that such an escalation would have severe consequences for Israel.

Details: Hezbollah's readiness was a focal point of Amirabdollahian's warning. He revealed that the group had meticulously considered various scenarios for a potential conflict, underscoring the need for Israel to cease its military operations in Gaza. Israel perceives Hezbollah as a significant and immediate threat, given the group's estimated possession of a substantial arsenal, including rockets, missiles, precision-guided projectiles, battle-hardened fighters, and military drones.

Also: His discussions included meetings with key figures, such as Saleh Arouri, a senior Hamas official in exile, and Ziad Nakhaleh, leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group. Amirabdollahian also met with Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who provided insights into the group's status in Lebanon and its preparedness for potential conflicts.
Amirabdollahian issued a strong warning to those involved in actions against Gaza's civilians, urging an immediate halt to prevent further escalation, emphasizing that time was running out.

instagram,"Palestinian-American boy stabbed to death in Gaza war-related killing in US.

Police in the United States have charged a 71-year-old man with murder and hate crime for fatally stabbing a six-year-old boy and seriously wounding his 32-year-old mother, alleging he singled out the victims because of their faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office in suburban Chicago said in a statement on Sunday.

Officers found both victims on Saturday morning at a home roughly 65km (40 miles) southwest of Chicago.

The boy, who was pronounced dead at the hospital, was stabbed 26 times with a large military-style knife, according to an autopsy on Sunday, the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

The mother had more than a dozen stab wounds on her body. She remained hospitalised on Sunday but was expected to survive.

The suspect, whose identity has not been revealed by the authorities, was found on Saturday, ‚Äúsitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence‚Äù with a cut on his forehead, police said.

He was in custody on Sunday and awaiting a court appearance. Police charged him with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crimes and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

‚ÄúOur hearts are heavy, and our prayers are with the darling boy and his mother,‚Äù Ahmed Rehab, the executive director of the Council of American Islamic Relations (CAIR) for the Chicago chapter, said in a statement on their website.

instagram,"There is an unprecedented quality about the October 7 attack by the Gaza-based Palestinian group Hamas inside Israel which has the potential to alter the strategic dynamics in West Asia in unforeseen ways that may possibly hurt India.

The one-sided Indian official response ‚Äì in favour of the confirmed aggressor of seven decades even by the UN‚Äôs reckoning, as resolution after resolution shows ‚Äì in this moment of a building international crisis and the wholesale destruction of human rights, the physical flattening of Palestinian townships through the use of air power and artillery over a tiny area, street by street, building by building, while a full-scale Israel-imposed blockade of food, medicines, water and electricity obtains, has been pusillanimous.

It causes injury to our self-esteem as a nation that could earlier stand erect in the company of nations rich or poor. This was principally on account of India‚Äôs humanist approach to international life and causes, its political philosophy of freedom and dignity from colonial oppression, and the effort to uphold democratic values at home, although this was a faltering proposition for a poor country with disparate and frequently disharmonious internal realities.

The current Indian stance on Israel-Palestine is likely to raise questions in West Asia/the Middle East, especially among its people if not in all of its monarchies and governments, as well as within India itself and its entire neighbourhood. In light of the unveiling of a new line on the Palestine-Israel question, India‚Äôs carefully nurtured reputation may also be expected to suffer in much of Africa and amongst sizeable sections of civil society in Western Europe and North America, though not necessarily with their governments.

instagram,"The events in the Middle East are so upsetting. And now we are seeing troves of misinformation. If you study this conflict you will see truth on both sides and evil on both sides, BUT you cannot compare Israel to Hamas.

I keep seeing statements saying that Israel is trying to commit genocide. Say what you will about Zionism and debates over land, but one thing you cannot say is that Israel wants to target civilians. That is the whole point of warning civilians and having them mass migrate to south Gaza. Of course, this is a huge humanitarian issue. Of course, this is putting human lives at stake. However, if they want a genocide, they would be aiming specifically for civilians. 

Do you know who does want genocide? Hamas!!! people don‚Äôt seem to know this but over the years Hamas has launched tens of thousands of missiles at Israel. They have specifically targeted civilian populations. They openly profess to want to kill all Jews. They have turned down all attempts at a two state solution. You don‚Äôt hear about these constant attacks because Israel has a good air defense system. If they did not have an air defense system, if they did not have border walls, we would be hearing about daily Deaths of Israelis.

Hamas fired missiles from hospitals and residential areas. Israel over the years has warned civilians that they are returning fire. They strike Hamas strongholds and weapon depots but sadly these are close to civilians. Hamas wants Israel to kill civilians so that they can anger the world and achieve global Jihad.

We need a humanitarian solution, but we also need a complete removal of Hamas. We need a two state solution, but that will never happen when terrorists are involved. Colonization has been an awful thing and criticisms are not without their merit, but saying that Israel wants genocide is just flat out wrong.",,1436,"{'like_count': 1436, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 107624}",Garth Davis üå±,,2023-10-16 22:24:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/292177373_604388161297666_5837009955639967921_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=oVq9Gi7BepIAX9qIlbh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBA0-_P21_yCNhWyV2b69Bq-tkQlHuCrwTusRaNpbDP4A&oe=6559FBAA,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyefLBkR9Cl/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391343972_2165578943819718_4088158427371236305_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=oAKEdxCyNr4AX-rpOtU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCXNb5m37yzO8edZfid3YHJouxzF7-y3cG_063IuResKQ&oe=655B0DC1
instagram,"Two wild elephants, aged between 20-25 and 30-35 years, have been electrocuted in a tragic incident in the Tai Rom Yen National Park in Thailand.

Local authorities were alerted by residents who discovered the lifeless bodies of the elephants on October 12.

The initial assessment suggests that the first elephant was electrocuted when they came into contact with the wire and fell to the ground, while the second elephant perished while trying to assist their companion.

The source of the electrocution was an electric fence set up by a durian orchard farmer, raising concerns about human-wildlife conflict in the region.

instagram,"""D√âJ√Ä KARMA"" by Vish Dhamija

üåüüåü‚ú®

This book presents a promising premise with the potential for a gripping legal thriller but falls short of delivering on its potential. 

The protagonist, Jay Singh, is depicted as the archetypal ""brilliant but troubled"" lawyer with a mysterious past. This character trope is overused in legal thrillers and lacks the freshness and originality needed to engage the reader.

Jay's unwavering commitment to winning cases, even at the cost of bending ethical boundaries, lacks a compelling backstory. His motivation to keep his dark past hidden and the need for redemption isn't developed sufficiently, making it hard to empathize with his character.

The story unfolds in a manner that feels formulaic and predictable. The high-stakes murder case that Jay takes on, while initially intriguing, follows a well-worn path in legal thrillers, with little to distinguish it from similar narratives.

For a legal thriller, the novel often fails to capture the intricacies and nuances of the legal world. Jay's ability to secure victories with unconventional methods stretches believability and detracts from the story's authenticity.

The pacing of the novel is uneven, with slow stretches that may test the reader's patience. While suspense is essential in this genre, the pacing issues disrupt the flow of the narrative and can lead to disengagement.

The novel hints at moral dilemmas faced by Jay as a defense lawyer, but it doesn't dive deep into these ethical challenges. A more profound exploration of the conflict between defending one's reputation and seeking justice would have added depth to the narrative.

Despite the overall entertainment factor, there may be moments when the plot appears a bit too character-centric, potentially overshadowing other important elements of the story.

In conclusion, it struggles to distinguish itself in the crowded legal thriller genre. It's hampered by predictable plot developments, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of legal realism. While the book starts with potential, it ultimately fails to deliver a truly engaging and thought-provoking legal thriller experience.",,1374,"{'like_count': 1374, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 58264}",Debabrata Mishra| Mr. Reviewer,,2023-10-16 08:21:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/295533144_1229824111167888_4470228227131839051_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nX0l_J4eHT0AX9zC9tR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCZg3GoINVNzmf1QbHaWQrahsvpwRjjLoMDila26Zp0IA&oe=655A2F52,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyc-ttiLP5j/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391199566_703505001645346_7264755014833778744_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=g9eAQsC0NtIAX9NF5Vc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAo26brjeJp7pEbQdtmRowywNQ87TmxH0okNQwRwR1MrA&oe=6541D293

This right here is why I speak up about how dehumanised Palestinians are. The papers can't even lable it as it; a bone-chilling murder. 'Hate crime,' they say. This is why we ask you to increase your media literacy, to pay attention to the lazy language and rhetoric around the Israelis governments apartheid policies.

""Among the most insidious tactics used to obscure the reality of the brutal Israeli governments occupation of Palestine is ‚Äúfaithwashing,‚Äù which frames the occupation as a centuries-old ‚Äúconflict‚Äù based on religious differences.

instagram,"After witnessing an all-time high mark multiple times last month, India's stock market indices Sensex and Nifty have been facing a rocky road this month amid the Israel-Hamas war. 

Amid the uncertain geopolitical and economic environment across the globe, Indian stocks are witnessing heavy selling from foreign investors.

Sensex is up nearly 0.7% this month, currently hovering around the 66,300 mark, whereas Nifty50 too is up nearly 0.7%, currently hovering around the 19,770 mark. Both Nifty50 and Sensex have jumped nearly 8.5% this year to date, with Sensex being up by more than 5,000 points and Nifty50 being up more 1,500 points. India's stock market indices had outperformed most of the world's major ones last year, click here to know more.

Both Sensex and Nifty had hit their all-time highs of 67,927 and 20,222 respectively in September.

Foreign investors have pulled out nearly Rs 9,800 crore from Indian equities this month so far. This came after Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) turned net sellers in September and pulled out Rs 14,767 crore. On the other hand, FPIs invested Rs 4,000 crore in the country's debt market during the period under review. With this, the total investment by FPIs in equity has reached Rs 1.1 trillion and over Rs 33,000 crore in the debt market this year so far.

In terms of sectors, FPIs continued to sell in financials, power, and IT, however, they continued to buy capital goods and automobiles.

Foreign investors selling Indian stocks heavily this month can be owed to a sustained rise in US bond yields and the uncertain environment resulting from the Israel-Hamas war. 

Going ahead, the trajectory of foreign investors' investments in India will be influenced not only by global inflation and interest rate dynamics but also by the developments and intensity of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director - Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India, said.",,1228,"{'like_count': 1224, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 36630}",Indiatimes Worth | Business Finance News,,2023-10-16 11:26:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/273906352_1843155545894496_667863836126403376_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=v6zTkwzHx-kAX-DIamy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDVynahI3vdD_um4pA8cTuMAqiqUqc79YSffarWCYfcTg&oe=655A7915,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydT1Q7yKRj/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391384772_137356296133056_1932941249357907274_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=PvgMWestUTIAX8GIrAH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA6dJJ5TEhYJLPGzg6HLr9uTzbiqfxYsiCnhLFxamKcmw&oe=653732AD

instagram,"A funeral will be held today in the Chicago area for Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian American 6-year-old boy, who was killed and his mother critically injured when they were stabbed on Saturday in Plainfield, Illinois. The suspect, Joseph Czuba is their landlord who allegedly targeted them because they were Muslim, authorities said. 

The mother has been in the U.S. for 12 years, and the boy was born in the United States. He celebrated his 6th birthday Oct. 6. Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the boy loved basketball, soccer and ‚Äúanything with a ball.‚Äù Rehab said the suspect had built a treehouse for the child, and the family had no previous problems with him.

Bolingbrook resident Wally Harazin, who drove his family to Plainfield to show solidarity with fellow Muslims, viewed the attack as personal; he has relatives in Gaza. He criticized what he believes is unfair coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict, leading to bias against Muslims and those from Middle Eastern countries.

‚ÄúHow can I protect my kids? How can every Muslim in this country, that we call free, how can they protect their kids. Is this the last hate crime that is going to be against Muslims? I do not think so,‚Äù Harazin said.

Speaking at the Dewan Rakyat, he said such a decision is not for Malaysia to make alone as any form of assistance to Palestine can only be delivered with the permission of the neighbouring countries.

instagram,"The FIDE World Cadets Chess Championships is scheduled to be held at Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt from 16th-26th October 2023. 

However, due to the severe conflict between Israel and Hamas going on right now at the Gaza strip, and Egypt sharing a border with Israel, the 83-member Indian delegation has withdrawn from the World Cadets this year. 

The event was originally scheduled to start from 14th October, but after an one-day postponement it is starting from 16th October. In this article, we bring you the views of the Indian players, coaches and officials about this situation:

instagram,"This week's podcast we discuss the topic of change and relationships. 

Words indeed hold a remarkable power, capable of shaping destinies on both an individual and collective scale. The influence of language is profound, as it can inspire and uplift, fostering positive change, or conversely, it can wound and divide, leading to chaos and conflict. From the impassioned speeches of leaders that have mobilized nations to the harmful rhetoric that has fueled hatred and discrimination, the impact of words is undeniable. In a world where communication is more widespread and accessible than ever, the responsibility to wield this power wisely is a crucial consideration for all, as words have the potential to both make and break the human spirit and the future of societies.

instagram,"We mourn the loss of Martti Ahtisaari, #NobelPeacePrize laureate 2008.

The former Finnish President was awarded the prize for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts.

Ahtisaari was a major contributor when Namibia achieved independence in 1989-90, arbitrated in Kosovo in 1999 and 2005-07, and helped to bring the long-lasting conflict in the Aceh province in Indonesia to an end in 2005.

‚ÄúThrough his untiring efforts and good results, he has shown what role mediation of various kinds can play in the resolution of international conflicts. The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to express the hope that others may be inspired by his efforts and his achievements‚Äù the Norwegian Nobel Committee stated in the announcement in October 2008.

Martti Ahtisaari believed that all conflicts can be revolved, and that peace is a question of will:

‚ÄúWars and conflicts are not inevitable. They are caused by human beings. There are always interests that are furthered by war. Therefore those who have power and influence can also stop them.‚Äù (Nobel Lecture, 2008)

instagram,"Do you ever feel like having a baby changed your relationship completely‚Äìand not in a good way? 
 
You‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs common for couples to face more conflict and dissatisfaction after a baby is born. 
 
In fact, 67% of couples report a decline in their relationship satisfaction during the first three years of their baby‚Äôs life.* 
 
There are many reasons why new parents often become unhappy with each other. 
 
„Ä∞ Both partners are transitioning into their new roles, which can be difficult. 
„Ä∞ They're sleep-deprived, making them both more irritable and less able to navigate conflict. 
„Ä∞ They are often overstimulated and overwhelmed with new parental responsibilities. 
„Ä∞ They might not see eye-to-eye on parenting decisions or how to adapt to life with a child. 
„Ä∞ Having children comes with new responsibilities and mental labor. 
 
It‚Äôs no wonder so many new parents are struggling! To top it off, the invisible load keeps us so bogged down and overwhelmed, it‚Äôs hard to know where to begin or how to steer our relationship back on track. 
 
This week on The Momwell Podcast, I‚Äôm joined by Aaron Steinberg, MA, co-founder of @thegrowtogetherco. We discuss the toll having a baby can take on a relationship and what you and your partner can do to get back on the same team. 
 
The good news is that we CAN learn how to work through conflict and navigate these relationship changes. We don‚Äôt have to wait until our children are older to reconnect and find satisfaction in our relationships again. 
 
If you‚Äôre feeling distant from your partner and crave the closeness you once felt, our Reconnect Bundle might be for you! 
 
You‚Äôll learn how to: 
 
‚úîÔ∏é Get on the same page 
‚úîÔ∏é Share the load of parenthood 
‚úîÔ∏é Better communicate with one another 
‚úîÔ∏é Grow closer in intimacy 
‚úîÔ∏é And build a meaningful bond

TICKETS: tinyurl.com/ewpawakening

Q: What‚Äôs your favorite song to perform?
A: Touch Me is my favorite song not only because Preston did an unimaginably gorgeous job with the choreography, but because the dance moves themselves feel cathartic and soothing to perform! It's a beautiful representation of the unity of the cast and a celebration of self expression <3

Q: What makes THIS Spring Awakening so important to watch?
A: This cast represents what our future will look like: strong-willed young humans of color who long to heal the scars of the past. So many issues of our world are soon to be left in the hands of the next generation--issues of the environment, society, physical and mental health, etc. As a cast of color with many immigrant parents, and experiences with intergenerational conflict, we found that we are especially passionate about these issues. We're determined to take charge of the future, discontinue toxic patterns, and find solutions. That determination is what fuels the fire of our Spring Awakening, and that is why it is so important to watch.

Q: What is your favorite line in the show?
A: I love what Ilse sings in her solo at the very end of the show -""Listen to what's in the heart of a child, a song so big in one so small."" It captures the precious idea that I mentioned before -children are the future leaders of the world, and should be listened to. Adults are understandably so complicated, and there is so much simplicity and truth that can be learned from a child. 

Q: Does your role as AMD help you learn all the tracks you understudy?
A: It absolutely does! While making rehearsal tracks for the cast, I had the opportunity to tune into each part early on in the process. As AMD I listen to the songs from an overall arrangement standpoint to make sure balance, harmony, and blend is okay, which forces me to be familiar with multiple parts at a time. But it should be known that this cast is so talented that they learned their parts instantaneously, and that they help me more than I help them :))",,1084,"{'like_count': 1028, 'comment_count': 56, 'num_users': 4789}",KAY üíúüáµüá≠,,2023-10-16 19:02:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/318298177_685662706305899_4925653626978689044_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Emkra7vNK_sAX_KJ1lQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC0t6o6ySFBbGGWfwdcMQom2ox3cpjux6l9lCCylH0puA&oe=655AE003,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyeH-VkPYIJ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391121293_3671429576515213_284326520039819160_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=MnfYNNSqVfAAX-XGNlE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBL5oB0LlCC8CGhP6NdDGxHDNFbEMt5mutNtgbOWZBU2g&oe=655A7AA6

instagram,"Maltese soldiers forming part of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon are reported safe according to AFM officials. 

This comes after the UN HQ in Lebanon, the UNIFIL, was struck by a missile in Naquora, as Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israeli fighters exchange fire across the border. 

Malta Armed Forced has nine soldiers in Lebanon, supporting a UN Mission, together with the Irish Defence Forces. 

‚ÄúAlthough the situation is volatile all Maltese soldiers are safe,‚Äù AFM spokesperson said, adding that they are closely monitoring the escalating situation. 

More than 10,000 peacekeeping troops are present at the borders of Lebanon‚Äôs border with Israel and Syria.

The UNIFIL issued a statement after the incident, saying no UN personnel were inside the building when the rocket hit. It is not yet clear who fired the missile. 

Any attacks on civilians or UN personnel go against international law. 

Conflict between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian militia group, erupted ten days ago, leading to mass bloodshed. Israel has ordered an evacuation of 1.1 million people Northern Gaza, on the weekend, a move decried by the UN.

instagram,"Man killed Muslim boy and wounded woman in hate crime motivated by Israeli-Hamas war, police say

A 71-year-old Illinois man accused of fatally stabbing a 6-year-old boy and seriously wounding a 32-year-old woman was charged with a hate crime Sunday. Police allege he singled out the victims because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas.

Officers found the woman and boy late Saturday morning at a home in an unincorporated area of Plainfield Township, southwest of Chicago, the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said in a statement on social media.

The boy was pronounced dead at a hospital. The woman had multiple stab wounds and was expected to survive, according to the statement. An autopsy on the child showed he had been stabbed dozens of times.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs statement said.

In recent days, police in U.S. cities and federal authorities have been on high alert for violence driven by antisemitic or Islamophobic sentiments. Jewish and Muslim groups have reported an increase of hateful and threatening rhetoric on social media.

According to the Will County sheriff‚Äôs office, the woman had called 911 to report that her landlord had attacked her with a knife, adding she then ran into a bathroom and continued to fight him off.

The man suspected in the attack was found Saturday outside the home and ‚Äúsitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence‚Äù with a cut on his forehead, authorities said.

Joseph M. Czuba of Plainfield was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crimes and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the sheriff‚Äôs office. He was in custody Sunday and awaiting a court appearance.

‚Å†
Mr. Wray said on a call with reporters on Sunday that the FBI is moving quickly to mitigate the threats and that it does not discount the possibility that Hamas and other terror groups could use the conflict to call for or plot attacks in the United States.‚Å†
‚Å†
""The threat is very much ongoing and in fact, the threat picture continues to evolve,"" Mr. Wray said, CBS reported. ""Here in the U.S., we cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or other foreign terrorist organizations could exploit the conflict to call on their supporters to conduct attacks on our own soil.""‚Å†
‚Å†
Speaking in an address to an international police chief conference in San Diego, California, on Saturday, Mr. Wray said the war in the Middle East is creating a ""heightened environment"" in the United States, where Hamas-inspired bad actors may seek to wreak havoc on home soil.‚Å†

instagram,"As many as 2,750 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip so far, while over 1,000 people are missing under the rubble of buildings destroyed by Israel air raids.

The data was provided by the Palestinian government on Monday as the bombing continues in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas both refuted the reports of a ceasefire in southern Gaza after security sources in Egypt said such a deal was due.

‚ÄúWe warn of a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe due to more than 1,000 martyr bodies under the ruins of destroyed houses,‚Äù said Eyad Al-Buzm, a spokesperson for the ministry.

The Ministry of Health that the death toll as a result of Israel‚Äôs continued aggression against Gaza and the West Bank has reached 2,808, and the number of injured was 10,950, including 2,750 dead and 9,700 injured in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the aggression on October 7.

On Sunday, Pope Francis said that a humanitarian corridor should be opened to help those under siege in Gaza, and appealed for the release of Israeli hostages taken by Palestinian groups in the enclaves.

instagram,"If you've seen our last videos, you know that we don't have many photos in the country of Chad because photos in certain areas are frowned upon. But we wanted to share a few of our memories along with a little about what we learned about the incredible people of Chad.

First, a little info about the country. Chad is a landlocked country in Central Africa that has a deep and complex history. It's at the crossroads of the Saharan and sub-Saharan regions, and encompasses deserts, savannahs, and mountains.

The country gained independence in 1960, but its history has been marred by political instability and conflict, which continue to impact it today. Chad is currently facing daily internal conflict and security challenges. A long civil war, intermittent rebellions, and ethnic tensions have plagued the country, leading to instability and displacement of populations. The Chadian people are stuck in the middle of all this conflict.

Despite the many challenges people face, Chad is home to a resilient and diverse population known for its warmth and hospitality. The Chadian people are composed of over 200 different ethnic groups, and are known for their strong sense of community, often coming together in times of need. Despite the ongoing conflicts, they continue to strive for a better future, working towards peace, stability, and development for their nation.

Even though we didn't speak their language (there are actually 100+ different local languages spoken in Chad in addition to French!), we met so many incredibly friendly people who went out of their way to welcome us to their country.

People here have so much joy and hope despite the difficulties many of them face! So thankful to be able to meet some of these incredible people while in Chad!!",,978,"{'like_count': 957, 'comment_count': 21, 'num_users': 86412}",Hudson and Emily,,2023-10-16 16:40:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/324537673_195559486396935_4154072115368426258_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ZFCV4YWblmMAX9FWbiL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCzuYd8X8SODS6XzkYAKDwZwmQXCX6WAyh-75e_AAwU1A&oe=655B6473,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyd3zQGtKPs/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391426438_340802448471672_6593691903746911960_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=VYzQm5VNGzUAX82lqk6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC-kwHfuhnUlfRupq6L_i7Tto0sntqAJY4IUPRu2qxgHQ&oe=6559A4E9

instagram,"Hamas claimed on Monday that Israel had not fully resumed water supplies to the Gaza Strip, despite earlier commitments to do so. An Israeli official responded by stating that some water was being provided to an area in the southern part of the enclave.

The cessation of water supply to Gaza was part of a broader siege imposed by Israel to restrict the flow of food and fuel into the region, which has a population of 2.3 million, many of whom rely on humanitarian aid. This move followed a surprise offensive by Hamas on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of 1,300 Israelis, according to officials.

In response to this attack, Israel launched a sustained bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip, resulting in significant casualties. The Gaza health ministry reported that the death toll from Israeli strikes had risen to approximately 2,750, with around 9,700 people injured. Moreover, the conflict has led to the displacement of approximately 600,000 Gazans, and essential supplies are dwindling.

instagram,"We invite you to read a poignant message from our Festival Director Nehad Khader written in 2021, ""Narrative is Everything.‚Äù The blog post, featuring a collection of Palestinian films screened at BlackStar and elsewhere, reminds us of how history impacts the present day and the importance of creating space to tell our stories in a world that often tries to silence them.‚Å†

‚ÄúWe are building on a language that‚Äôs been co-created by generations of Palestinian, Indigenous, Black, and anti-colonial resistance movements around the world... Palestinian stories create space for us to love each other, to love ourselves, to love our cause. They document the history of my people‚Äôs freedom struggle. Palestinian stories also do something more radical: they help us think both more broadly and deeply about racism, incarceration, resistance, resource theft, apartheid, and even climate change.‚Äù - Nehad Khader

From AMBULANCE (2016), a raw, first-person account of the last war in Gaza, to IN VITRO (2019, pictured above), a narrative short set in the aftermath of an eco-disaster in Bethlehem. ‚Å†

What would it be like for you and your spouse if you could turn any conflict into connection? 

If you are like me, that might seem nearly impossible.

My husband & I had no idea how to turn conflict into connection. We didn‚Äôt even know it was possible. 

And then, we learned one very simple way to turn any conflict into connection.

We want as many couples as possible to get this information, so we have created a simple playbook that you can use repeatedly to turn Conflict-to-Connection.

instagram,"Praying for Peace in Israel and Palestine ‚ù§Ô∏è
The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine reached new levels over the past few days, with attacks taking lives on both sides of the Gaza Strip. This decades-long conflict is nuanced, and we should all strive to understand without bias. Use these images to mourn the loss of innocent lives as we continue to call for peace.

instagram,"The first image is of Wadea al Fayoume, a beautiful Palestinian American boy dressed in a red checked shirt wearing a plastic hat that reads happy birthday. It was taken a few weeks ago when he turned 6. 

The second image is a mugshot of Joseph M Czuba, the 71 year old landlord who stabbed Wadea and his mother in their home in Illinois yesterday. She survived but is in serious condition. He died from his injuries. 

Officers have enough evidence to charge Czuba with a hate crime and announce that he targeted Wadea and his mother ""for being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and Israelis"".

Over the last few days, Jews have been reaching out to me because they say they feel scared. And I get it. Situations like this always cause a rise in Antisemitism. BUT IT WORKS BOTH WAYS. Situations like this always cause a rise in Islamophobia too. 

And the first child to die on US/UK soil since the war started is a Palestinian one. I encourage all my Jewish friends to take a long hard look at this photograph and remember his name the next time you feel scared and use that as a means to justify your Zionism.

Also, do not ever forget who colonised Palestine in the late 19th/early 20th century. Do not ever forget who gave the land (like it was theirs to give) to make way for an Israeli state. Do not ever forget which countries profit the most from the sales of arms and who are invested in maintaining a ""strong friendship"" with a country in the Middle East to suit its own needs. 

And most of all do not forget the role we all play in encouraging despicable human beings like Czuba to murder innocent children in order to make himself feel better. I hope he gets everything that's coming to him. 

Ps. We all know how Meta are suppressing posts that include certain terms but I refuse to be cowed by that. This is my account and I say what I believe needs to be said. If you're able to understand why fighting for Palestinian rights is part of Fat activism then please share and comment üëá.

instagram,"TRIGGER WARNING:

Joseph Czuba, a 71-year-old Illinois man, was charged with hate crimes for fatally stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, and injuring his mother, Hanaan Shahin. 

The attack, driven by religious animosity and linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict, occurred in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago. 

The boy sustained 26 stab wounds from a military-style knife with a 7-inch serrated blade, while his 32-year-old mother suffered multiple stab wounds but is expected to survive.

President Joe Biden condemned the act, emphasising that the victims, Palestinian Muslims, sought refuge in America for peace and security. Czuba faces charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two hate crime counts, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

The Will County Sheriff's Office confirmed that both victims were targeted due to their Muslim faith and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict. Czuba, exercising his constitutional right, did not provide statements during police interviews.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) identified the victims and urged an end to Islamophobic rhetoric and anti-Palestinian racism. FBI Director Christopher Wray cautioned vigilance against increasing threats, especially from potential lone actors influenced by recent events. He emphasised the need to be watchful in this heightened environment.

Referencing the Kenya Kwanza Government's pledge to address fuel prices upon taking office, the MP demanded a return to the negotiating table, but he also raised concerns about the status of that promise.

‚ÄúCan we do fuel with Ghana because they also have fuel? Can we think of other countries we can work with? It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre tied into situation and very soon we shall be told that even the Israel-Palestine conflict can cause disruptions,‚Äù she posed on Citizen TV‚ÄôS Daybreak show early Monday.

She raised concerns that Kenya's reliance on specific fuel sources could lead to disruptions.

The legislator emphasized the importance of watching how neighboring countries such as Tanzania and Uganda manage their fuel prices, implying that Kenyans may not see a decrease in fuel prices in the near future.

‚ÄúWe have to rethink as a country because we don‚Äôt know how high the price of fuel will go and if it will ever drop,‚Äù she posited.

instagram,"Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @patrickteahantherapy A healthy family talks it over and works it out.‚Å†
‚Å†
There are families like this out there, and the parents model:‚Å†
‚Å†
*Conflict resolution between siblings‚Å†
*Good communication around everything from boundaries to logistics‚Å†
*Healthy intimacy and mutual respect between parents‚Å†
*Empathy and understanding during bumps‚Å†
‚Å†
A toxic family system for lack of resources and willingness to use them if present will engage in the following:‚Å†
‚Å†
*Distracting from more significant family issues by scapegoating a member‚Å†
*Cultivates contempt vs. empathy and respect‚Å†
*Minimizes unfair issues, and conflict due to emotional laziness (cowardice)‚Å†
*Conditions members to believe that conflict is selfish, and we are left to believe it isn't worth it (because it isn't growing up)‚Å†
*Believes that not bringing issues up is a morally good thing‚Å†
‚Å†
As we grow and heal from childhood trauma, we need to try to have faith in healthy conflict while finishing business with our family's toxicity around intimacy, respect, and connection.‚Å†

instagram,"In an open letter to his friend Cardinal Dominik Duka, published October 13 exclusively by Settimo Cielo, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M√ºller criticizes in depth the response given last September 25 by Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern√°ndez, the new prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, to a series of questions from Duka himself regarding Eucharistic communion for the divorced and ‚Äúremarried.‚Äù

Duka, archbishop emeritus of Prague, forwarded these questions last July, on behalf of the Czech episcopal conference, to the dicastery headed by Cardinal Fern√°ndez, who had in none other than Cardinal M√ºller his penultimate predecessor, abruptly dismissed in 2017 by Pope Francis, with whom Fern√°ndez is, instead, bosom buddies.

But before reading M√ºller‚Äôs letter, it is helpful to go back over what led up to the dramatic conflict.

Last October 4, in the opening speech of the Synod on Synodality, Francis went at it with ‚Äúthe pressure of public opinion‚Äù that, ‚Äúwhen there was the Synod on the Family,‚Äù wanted to have it believed ‚Äúthat Communion was going to be given to the divorced.‚Äù

But he failed to mention that none other than he, the Pope, in February of 2014, a few months before the opening of that synod, had convened a two-day consistory behind closed doors among all the cardinals, obliging them to discuss an introductory talk by Cardinal Walter Kasper fully in support of Communion for the divorced and ‚Äúremarried.‚Äù

instagram,"An incident occurred in Plainfield, Illinois, where a man named Joseph Czuba, aged 71, has been charged with murder and hate crimes. He allegedly stabbed to death a six-year-old boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, who was Muslim, and seriously wounded the boy's mother. Both victims were tenants of Czuba, who reportedly targeted them because of their religion and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. The attack took place in their rented residence.

The 32-year-old mother was attacked with a military-style knife and managed to call the police from the bathroom. She sustained more than a dozen stab wounds but is expected to survive. Tragically, her son, Wadea Al-Fayoume, aged six, was stabbed over two dozen times and later died in the hospital.

More: When authorities arrived at the scene, they found Joseph Czuba outside the property with a cut on his face. He was taken to the hospital for treatment before being charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, hate crimes, and aggravated battery. While he did not provide a statement, investigators identified his motive as targeting the victims due to their Muslim faith and their connection to the Middle Eastern conflict between Hamas and Israelis.
The U.S. Justice Department has initiated a federal hate crime investigation into this case.

‚ú®Hour of the Hounds‚ú®

In the early 1990s, when the underworld dominated every sphere of life, Prakash, a rookie customs officer, gets transferred to Dapoli, a remote station on the west coast of India.

Inexperienced Prakash is soon pitted against the ruthless organization of Salim, an underworld don and smuggler operating from Dubai. Serendipitously, Prakash foils a few operations of Salim, and soon there are cracks in the vast, well-oiled machinery of the gangsters. The vengeful Don now wants Prakash dead.

A conflict that seems one-sided begins to even out as a motley crew that includes Shelley, Prakash‚Äôs college crush; Kabir, an upright and adventurous police officer; and a few of Prakash‚Äôs lieutenants rally behind Prakash. Salim‚Äôs actress girlfriend, Shabnam, infatuated by Prakash‚Äôs ideals, also breaks rank. They form the ‚ÄòHowling Hounds‚Äô, hunting Salim‚Äôs operatives in India. Salim expected a conventional retaliation from them, but the fun-loving friends opted to break the rules, bureaucratic procedures and ideals to spring a surprising trap on Salim.

‚ú®A quick, fast paced read depicting the underworld crimes with a lot twists!! It kept me entertained throughout and I liked how the author keeps it authentic as well as fun! Go for it if you enjoy crime/ suspenseful stories!

instagram,"A 71-year-old Illinois man stabbed a 6-year-old boy to death and critically wounded his mother, in Chicago, US, in an alleged anti-Muslim hate crime, the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Sunday, calling it a ‚Äúsenseless and cowardly act of violence.‚Äù

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs office said in a news release.

US President Joe Biden condemned the killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy as a ""horrific act of hate"" on Sunday, after authorities charged the assailant with murder and hate crimes for an attack allegedly linked to the war between Israel and Hamas.

We named him Malachi to remind him of the world in which he was born. In chaos and war, He will stand before the Lord as a priest (Malachi 2:7) and a messenger (Malachi 3:1) to remind us of God‚Äôs covenantal love toward Israel (Malachi 3:17), His treasured possession.

We named him Emmaus in confidence of Jesus‚Äôs leadership over his life to  know¬†God and understand¬†His will through scripture. We believe he will have an Emmaus moment (Luke 24:31-35) where his heart will begin to burn, where a defining moment will set his feet running toward Jerusalem to bear witness of the resurrected Son of Man. 

We named him ÁªçÂÆâ (Mount Zion - Èî°ÂÆâÂ±±)¬†to remind him of the Lord's desire for Zion, Jerusalem to be His dwelling place (Psalm 132:13-14). ÂÆâ also means ""Shalom‚Äù.

What continues to happen to them is horrific as well. We must uphold the sanctity of life regardless of race, nationality and origin.

There is no outrage or condemnation or lit up buildings or flags everywhere when the victims are Palestinians. ‚†Ä

We‚Äôre standing by watching as our government fuels a deadly siege of 2 million people depriving them of basic human necessities. The amount of propaganda trying to justify over a 1000 kids murdered is abhorrent.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
We should all sincerely be praying daily for all the innocent lives being affected by this conflict such as the 6 year old boy brutally stabbed in Chicago. What kind of parents would we be if we weren‚Äôt moved by every image of a murdered child? Regardless of our beliefs politically?‚†Ä

instagram,"The history of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh ended in the old manner of conflict resolution: siege and expulsion. For Armenians, a classic relic ethnic minority whose Christianity and peculiar alphabet date to the epic struggles between the Romans and the Parthians, it was another Genocide.

Additionally, this conflict is being considered by many worldwide to be a clash of civilizations. Instead, in its emboldening of traditional regional powers like Turkey, scrambling for geopolitical spoils after the retreat of superpowers, it's a harbinger of the coming world disorder.
___________________________________________________

In an op-ed, U.S. Senator Gary Peters of Michigan writes that Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh face an existential threat ‚Äî and the United States must come to their aid.

The U.S. must help ensure that the people of Nagorno-Karabakh receive the humanitarian assistance they desperately need. Critically ‚Äî given the history of this region ‚Äî the United States must do everything it can to bring in neutral observers to shine a light on the conditions the Azerbaijani government has created.

During the handover at Tjeya village, Sambyu Traditional Authority hompa Sophia Mundjembe applauded the company for the gesture, saying that bringing potable water closer to the people at Tjeye will reduce human-wildlife conflict. She said people will have access to clean, healthy water, eliminating the need to go to the river to collect water for household use.

instagram,"Complaint filed against Rizwan in India for offering prayer on the field

A complaint has been filed by an Indian lawyer with the International Cricket Council against Mohammad Rizwan for offering prayer on the field and dedicating Pakistan's victory over Sri Lanka to the people of Gaza, Times Now reported.

Rizwan scored a match-winning century against Sri Lanka, which he dedicated to the people of Gaza in light of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.

Vineet Jindal, an advocate of Supreme Court of India lodged a complaint

with the ICC against the Pakistani cricketer.

""This is a complaint about Pakistan Cricket Player, Mohammad Rizwan, who was seen offering namaz on the cricket field during his team's opening match of the ongoing ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023 on Friday (October 6) against the Netherlands in Hyderabad,"" the complaint read.

Jindal went on to add that Rizwan offering prayer on the cricket field amid many Indians was symbolic of the intentional depiction of his religion which stands against the spirit of the game.

""This very act of the player raises questions about the spirit of the match and raises a question of the ideology, the player follows while playing the match. The act of displaying his religion by Mohammed Rizwan purposefully depicts his intent to message that he is a Muslim, defeating the spirit of sports,"" he said.

Rizwan was seen offering prayers amid the field while his teammates were waiting for the drinks during the break, he added.

For him, the Pakistani wicket-keeping batter's statement in his press conference regarding the dedication of his victory to the people of Gaza further attested to his religious and political ideology.",,613,"{'like_count': 596, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 82565}",kashmir_news_24√ó7 (official),,2023-10-16 10:49:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/95946022_519787842050015_3508014650400702464_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4ECpW61sx2EAX_-ul95&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA-j6WT2C_uGiiMG-7h8q8U_CLp7ZmuWtphy2avMYxKww&oe=655A8030,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydPmrePVhm/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391426438_287997084081432_5743969914994369750_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=lJmzH4NGDncAX9IWfe8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAB3LdAIzpnqRiA14gnICisK55zDBprBMgqKparwC2aDQ&oe=653A72B7

On Wednesday, Oct. 11, when classes resumed after Fall Break, Cornell Hillel and Cornellians for Israel hosted a candlelight vigil to commemorate the Israeli lives lost in Hamas‚Äôs initial attack on Israel on Saturday, Oct. 7. Approximately 750 Cornell students, faculty and staff attended the vigil to listen to stories of those affected by the conflict.

Molly Goldstein ‚Äô25, co-president of the Cornell Center for Jewish Living, expressed hope that the vigil would inspire the Cornell community to condemn violence and join together during a period of immense suffering. 
‚ÄúWhat I hope to see most is that people condemn violence. There are civilians on both sides who are living in the worst nightmare they could have possibly imagined,‚Äù Goldstein said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôd hope that the Cornell community wants peace, and wants harmony, and hopes that the violence and the terrorism will end.‚Äù

On Friday, Oct. 14, around 200 students, faculty and community members gathered on Ho Plaza for a vigil held by Students for Justice in Palestine, after a collective moment of silence in honor of those killed in the conflict. The vigil came mere hours after the Israel Ministry of Defense and the Israel Defense Forces issued a directive calling for the evacuation of over one million Palestinians residing in the northern region of Gaza. 

As students processed these events and their anger with Cornell‚Äôs response to the war which did not mention the word Palestine, some, like SJP member Maryam Ismail ‚Äô27, found comfort in the vigil.

‚ÄúThis was a really safe space for people to talk about how they‚Äôre feeling and grieve openly, and I think it‚Äôs beautiful that people from all different backgrounds came to support each other,‚Äù Ismail said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important, it‚Äôs healing and it established a community that people didn‚Äôt even think existed here.‚Äù

Silence is also privilege. The notion of being able to ‚Äúturn off‚Äù the news, social media, choose not to read anything is tempting but the citizens of any war aren‚Äôt able to do that and nor are the diaspora of those affected wherever in the world they are.
I‚Äôm also aware that some who have spoken out, who have direct experience of Palestine are having the most horrific DMs sent to them and that must stop. 
The time for fighting on I‚Äôll social media should be done. Take time and listen to the voices coming from the Middle East, from the Palestinian diaspora, and uphold and lift those voices.

Even better for the BJP, the Israel-Palestine conflict allows the party to advance its Hindutva agenda and its national security plank.

The boy was stabbed 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch (18-cm) serrated blade, the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said in a statement.

The 32-year-old woman had multiple stab wounds and is expected to survive the attack that occurred on Saturday in Plainfield Township, about 64 kilometres (40 miles) southwest of Chicago.

instagram,"An Unexpected Path, by Megan McSpadden
Pub Date: November 17 

‚ÄúSometimes unexpected paths lead to the best destinations.‚Äù

The perfect fall romance is nearly here! 

I am thrilled to be an early reader for An Unexpected Path! Megan‚Äôs DEBUT novel is a knock out. An avid reader herself, Megan pulled the best parts from contemporary romance to create a novel that was charming, endearing and unputdownable! 

Forced proximity; 
a few mishaps which had me laughing and maybe cringing in the best possible way; 
quirky neighbours and side characters; 
reticence paired with longing; heartbreak, hope and resilience. 
Oh, and 21 puppies . Give or take. 

I really loved the ease of Meg‚Äôs writing. Her pacing was pitch perfect and her story building was all at once relatable while also having me want go on a hike just to sprain my ankle! 
#iykyk and if not, read the book and you‚Äôll soon understand - trust me! 

Get those Kindles ready!!

Synopsis: 
Highly sought after conflict photographer, relationship-averse Marley Cunningham thrives on adrenaline and the chaos of her nomadic life. But when the passion for her career starts to wane, she decides a hike is the best way to shake the doubts from her mind. Spraining her ankle and being rescued by a handsome stranger and his pack of dogs is not part of the plan.
Big-hearted, reclusive Bennett Morgan has spent his life playing football then pursuing medicine. After a catastrophic diagnosis shatters both goals he feels lost for the first time He packs up his life and two dogs and returns to the home. He finds joy in starting a dog sanctuary.
After a rainstorm washes away the road to Bennett‚Äôs home, he is shocked to find Marley injured and alone on his secluded trail. From the moment she is hoisted onto his back, Marley is drawn in by Bennett‚Äôs kindness, strength and calm nature. Bennett realizes that a bit more human connection in his life might not be such a bad thing, especially when that human is Marley.
Marley begins to explore her feelings for not just her career but the man who rescued her.

instagram,"What Happened: An incident occurred in Plainfield, Illinois, where a man named Joseph Czuba, aged 71, has been charged with murder and hate crimes. He allegedly stabbed to death a six-year-old boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, who was Muslim, and seriously wounded the boy's mother. Both victims were tenants of Czuba, who reportedly targeted them because of their religion and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. The attack took place in their rented residence.

Details: The 32-year-old mother was attacked with a military-style knife and managed to call the police from the bathroom. She sustained more than a dozen stab wounds but is expected to survive. Tragically, her son, Wadea Al-Fayoume, aged six, was stabbed over two dozen times and later died in the hospital.

More: When authorities arrived at the scene, they found Joseph Czuba outside the property with a cut on his face. He was taken to the hospital for treatment before being charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, hate crimes, and aggravated battery. While he did not provide a statement, investigators identified his motive as targeting the victims due to their Muslim faith and their connection to the Middle Eastern conflict between Hamas and Israelis.

Also: The U.S. Justice Department has initiated a federal hate crime investigation into this case.

The suspect, identified as landlord Joseph M. Czuba, remained silent during police questioning. However, detectives concluded that the victims were targeted due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù as stated by the sheriff‚Äôs office.‚Å†
‚Å†
Czuba is now facing charges including first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crimes, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.‚Å†

Rizwan had previously dedicated his century to #Gaza residents amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, but the ICC took no action after investigating.

Regardless of one's religious or cultural background, it is imperative as humans that we cannot turn a blind eye to the dire situation unfolding in Palestine. We cannot, and must not, stay silent; we must talk about it openly. This is not a 'complicated conflict,' nor is it a situation that necessitates excessive nuance. It's not a 'geopolitical event' that requires us to make vague condemnations of 'bad actors' on 'both sides.'

What we are witnessing is nothing short of a genocide. The Israeli state's actions against the Palestinian people are unequivocally a genocide, and it is occurring right before our eyes. There is no room for ambiguity; it is a genocide, carried out by the Israeli state against the Palestinian population. You don't need to read between the lines: Israel has openly, with little resistance from so-called liberal democracies, severed Gaza's access to essential resources such as water, food, and electricity. This has left more than two million Palestinians, including a million children, deprived of even the most basic necessities for life.

Consider this staggering fact: in just six days, Israel has dropped 6,000 bombs on the besieged coastal enclave, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, half of whom are innocent children. Israel's use of internationally banned white phosphorus, the heartbreaking deaths of babies as young as seven days old, and their orders for 1.1 million people to evacuate their homes within 24 hours, followed by bombings that injure and kill those attempting to flee, are all reprehensible acts.

What we are witnessing is nothing less than ethnic cleansing in full view of the world. We cannot, in good conscience, look away from these unspeakable horrors. It is our moral duty to discuss this crisis openly and take decisive action to bring it to an end. Humanity demands nothing less.

Furthermore, it is crucial to be aware that Instagram is actively restricting accounts that post about the situation in Palestine. Therefore, we urge you to share and talk about it as much as possible to ensure that the truth is not silenced. Via: @theafghan

instagram,"Sudan is facing the worst displacement crisis in the world with 7.1 million people driven out of their homes as a result of intense civil conflict.

‚ÄúThe humanitarian situation in Sudan is catastrophic with no end in sight and civilians are the ones paying the price,‚Äù said International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Director General.

Since the escalation of tensions in mid-April of this year, a staggering 4.5 million people have been displaced, according to the latest figures recorded by the IOM.

Approximately three million are originally from Khartoum, the capital and epicenter of the conflict.

The surge of newly displaced civilians across Sudan has overwhelmed public services and resources in the areas of arrival, ""creating appalling living conditions for millions of people who face a daily struggle to survive.""

""The situation is further exacerbated by significant damage to infrastructure, the collapse of banking and financial services, frequent interruptions to the internet, telecommunications and electricity supply, and the destruction of health facilities,"" IOM wrote.

In addition, over 1.2 million people have fled to neighbouring countries with Chad receiving the most asylum-seekers followed by Egypt, South Sudan, Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, and Libya.

‚ÄúWe urge the international community not to turn their back on Sudan and to urgently support relief efforts before this leads to an even deeper humanitarian tragedy.‚Äù

In October 2021, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) jointly overthrew Sudan's transitional government. The escalation of this year came about after weeks of tensions between the SAF and RSF over security force reform during negotiations for a new transitional government, according to Amnesty International.

However, violence, power struggles, and ethnic tensions have been longstanding issues within Sudan, with the first civil war starting in 1955.

instagram,"Which Libra piece is your favourite? 
1 or 2? ‚öñÔ∏è

‚ÄúLibra seeks to answer questions of identity through relationship - relationship w/ other; other humans, animals, art, music, & w/ their environment. In doing so it seeks to tune in w/ intimacy & vulnerability to the dynamics that hold relationship w/ other in equilibrium. Libra understands that an individual unit affects the whole &that it is not independent of that whole. The path to creating beauty, according to Libra, is to join pieces together to form something, anything, that is greater than the sum of its parts. For Libra this is where beauty lives, in the synergy between parts, pieces, dynamics, &opposites.

This is also the track through which Libra has become associated w/ some favorite buzzwords - harmony, equilibrium, balance, and beauty. Libra holds a desire to find justice in harmony. But this struggle for justice is not for justice's sake, it is for the sake of the whole, the ideal, the organism in authenticity, in operational completion - an organism in joy is an organism whose parts come together to do what they can‚Äôt do alone.

‚ôéÔ∏è holds the dynamics of equilibrium &the harmony of interconnection w/ wisdom and discernment. It is curious and open to the diversity of truths that two or more halves bring to a whole concept. Libra‚Äôs interested in harmony, yes, but only insofar as it holds the knowing that the life cycle always contains and requires synergy &cooperation between parts and pieces. At its core, it does not aspire to avoid hard, inconvenient truths or reach for harmony at the expense of avoiding conflict - balance is not balance when it only seeks one side of the emotional spectrum. Harmony means that it wants to balance the scales, not that it wants to tip toward a more harmonious end. Libra knows there is no such thing - all light contains darkness, all joy contains conflict. 

Libra‚Äôs here to teach us about the both/and rather than the either/or. Truth for Libra is this space in between. Libra‚Äôs greatest gift is to dive into the paradox of the both/and - to look at every side, to examine every reflection & to see it all w/beauty &possibility‚Ä¶‚Äù cont‚Äôd below",,481,"{'like_count': 457, 'comment_count': 24, 'num_users': 46901}",moonjube üêö,,2023-10-16 19:14:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/352054892_216832697878512_9019342019775914599_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EuTxPKAnT1wAX-Wp8dl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAl0yhyyNWESVzrUoyDY0jtYWI4dEPIdu0B18MfX9DldQ&oe=655A84BA,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyeJZP7yrg7/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391429360_2398882616957866_2352282664815482918_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AeRULHNaSi8AX_qYG1N&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBus3P6OtfTHK_ojZzm18WbQdl99wP9roiDw30tmlJQ8A&oe=6559B90B

instagram,"Talking about books with all the chaos happening in Australia and the rest of the world always feels so very trivial.

I read Women Talking as my first Miriam Toews last month and i very much appreciated it. I‚Äôve never read anything like it and can now understand the attention it‚Äôs garnered over the years. It questions the notion of pacifism which is core to the characters‚Äô Mennonite faith. However, this is looked at from the perspective of abused women ‚Äî ie. a group of people being oppressed by their male counterparts. The decision whether to leave the community or stay is an extremely difficult one to make for the women. We see the arguments between the characters and it‚Äôs painful to see the internal conflict they have to go through as victims of abuse who are also still deeply attached to their faith. This book made me think about pacifism (and its often impossibility) and how important it is to understand the nuance of violence when we‚Äôre talking about real life issues. How critical it is to understand the power imbalance between the oppressed and the oppressor, and the context and history of it all instead of simply taking a naive stance. This is not to equate the true events that the novel‚Äôs based on with our current crises. My mind is jumbled all over the place right now and i simply can‚Äôt switch off seeing connections in real life vs the political elements that i see in books.

I am grateful for this space, the education it‚Äôs provided, and the push it‚Äôs given me to continually think about matters critically rather than to take what mainstream media feeds us at face value. Take a pause if you need and do take care of yourself, but this is not the time to look away. Get educated, keep learning, and continue sharing without shying away from the hard conversations. The choice to be informed is yours.

The world is a hard place to be in today; the absolute least we could do is to challenge the status quo, and continue to show up.",,468,"{'like_count': 450, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 10019}",P A U L I N E,,2023-10-16 06:17:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/119452995_638301876876221_163243536972028576_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KsMdlrQhxCoAX92mWD8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCaeHN8EPRhJtz5T6kfYApZtmb6iFMAvg4bsTfUp3n4vw&oe=655A580A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CycwbEyLeQp/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391440275_704982334435078_4882698202794279127_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=vvfNVh52Jo8AX_czP2Y&_nc_oc=AQn_ODiHPQ6ygQmf8aXrmNcaPUpZQl-mP7A5qUVbhgFmQZbgOFvbtycjD7Kagrckvpg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDUwgsgL_WuWh22bihOIZfKwnI8xITmdyZyo1nNx_EOyQ&oe=6559832B

The profit from each sale was going to charity, but the cost of print materials, packing materials, postage, that‚Äôs money I don‚Äôt personally have and it needs to come out of the sale for a charity print to work.

instagram,"Last Saturday, those of us in the United States woke up to the news of terror attacks by Hamas against ordinary civilians in Israel ‚Äî innocent women, men, children, and the elderly brutally assaulted and killed. As devastating reports from the region continue to hit our inboxes and internet browsers, it‚Äôs been hard to escape the onslaught of information, misinformation, and insensitive comments about the conflict in Israel and Palestine.

It also became immediately clear that our Jewish friends and loved ones are hurting ‚Äî and terrified. So are our Muslim friends and loved ones. We are all hurting as we witness this heartbreaking story that continues to unfold.

Some carried signs that read ‚ÄúFree Palestine,‚Äù ‚ÄúDecolonize Palestine‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrom The River To Sea Palestine Will Be Free.‚Äù Others held signs denouncing the United States‚Äô aid to Israel. Many waved the Palestinian flag which is comprised of three horizontal stripes of black, white and green and a red triangle.

A young woman named Noor, who did not give her last name, spoke about her anguish. She said four family members in Gaza were killed and eight of their homes were demolished.

instagram,"Regardless of one's religious or cultural background, it is imperative as humans that we cannot turn a blind eye to the dire situation unfolding in Palestine. We cannot, and must not, stay silent; we must talk about it openly. This is not a 'complicated conflict,' nor is it a situation that necessitates excessive nuance. It's not a 'geopolitical event' that requires us to make vague condemnations of 'bad actors' on 'both sides.'

What we are witnessing is nothing short of a genocide. The Israeli state's actions against the Palestinian people are unequivocally a genocide, and it is occurring right before our eyes. There is no room for ambiguity; it is a genocide, carried out by the Israeli state against the Palestinian population. You don't need to read between the lines: Israel has openly, with little resistance from so-called liberal democracies, severed Gaza's access to essential resources such as water, food, and electricity. This has left more than two million Palestinians, including a million children, deprived of even the most basic necessities for life.

Consider this staggering fact: in just six days, Israel has dropped 6,000 bombs on the besieged coastal enclave, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, half of whom are innocent children. Israel's use of internationally banned white phosphorus, the heartbreaking deaths of babies as young as seven days old, and their orders for 1.1 million people to evacuate their homes within 24 hours, followed by bombings that injure and kill those attempting to flee, are all reprehensible acts.

What we are witnessing is nothing less than ethnic cleansing in full view of the world. We cannot, in good conscience, look away from these unspeakable horrors. It is our moral duty to discuss this crisis openly and take decisive action to bring it to an end. Humanity demands nothing less.

Furthermore, it is crucial to be aware that Instagram is actively restricting accounts that post about the situation in Palestine. Therefore, we urge you to share and talk about it as much as possible to ensure that the truth is not silenced""

instagram,"A Chicago-area landlord was arrested and charged with murder and hate crimes after authorities said he stabbed and killed a 6-year-old boy and seriously wounded his mother, allegedly because the tenants are Muslim.
Joseph M. Czuba, 71, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of a hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the Will County, Illinois, Sheriff‚Äôs Office said in a news release. The US Justice Department has also opened a federal hate crime investigation into the attack, US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Sunday.
The sheriff‚Äôs office said Czuba did not make a statement to detectives but investigators determined the victims were ‚Äútargeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
The family is Palestinian and ‚Äúcame to America seeking what we all seek‚Äîa refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace,‚Äù according to the White House. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden said they were ‚Äúshocked and sickened‚Äù over the attack and offered their condolences to the family in a statement released by the White House Sunday.
Authorities were called to the residence in unincorporated Plainfield Township, roughly 40 miles southwest of Chicago, shortly before noon Saturday after a woman called 911 saying her landlord had attacked her, according to the sheriff‚Äôs office.

When deputies arrived, they found Czuba sitting on the ground, near the home‚Äôs driveway, the release said. The two victims were found in a bedroom, each with ‚Äúmultiple stab wounds,‚Äù and were taken to the hospital, according to the release.

The boy was stabbed 26 times and succumbed to his injuries, the sheriff‚Äôs office said. The 32-year-old woman, who had more than a dozen stab wounds, is recovering at the hospital and is expected to survive, the office said.",,412,"{'like_count': 347, 'comment_count': 65, 'num_users': 171265}",TEA N THE SHADE üå¥,,2023-10-16 10:56:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/342228610_169083825722377_7705872370057620324_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=3nVIkMMqP8oAX-paR_Z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAdkLoIfziHfABOzCnBnYmDtyWXyRR04ICGPQ2uceBUVg&oe=655B4695,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydQYaXOR29/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391552829_313810131381704_6482104951896904476_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=YrR5gXLd_bMAX81R82g&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBe3fLw-InyKW7lMx_B7SS5QtYdFOnHzDycOJ5OeB14NQ&oe=653D7A33

instagram,"Israel and Hamas have firmly rejected reports of a ceasefire in southern Gaza, dashing hopes of an imminent end to the devastating conflict that has gripped the region. The announcement comes in the wake of security sources in Egypt suggesting that a ceasefire deal was on the horizon.

Rescuers on the ground reveal that over 1,000 Palestinians are currently missing under the rubble of buildings, casualties of the relentless Israeli airstrikes that have unrelentingly pounded Gaza in recent days.

instagram,"in the United States have charged a 71-year-old man with murder and hate crime for fatally stabbing a six-year-old boy and seriously wounding his 32-year-old mother, alleging he singled out the victims because of their faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office in suburban Chicago said in a statement on Sunday.

Officers found both victims on Saturday morning at a home roughly 65km (40 miles) southwest of Chicago

The boy, who was pronounced dead at the hospital, was stabbed 26 times with a large military-style knife, according to an autopsy on Sunday, the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

The mother had more than a dozen stab wounds on her body. She remained hospitalised on Sunday but was expected to survive

instagram,"In response to the Middle East tensions, investors have turned to gold, which is considered a safe haven asset during uncertain times.

Hyderabad: The gold rates in Hyderabad have once again crossed the Rs 60,000 mark due to escalating tensions in the Israel-Palestine conflict. They are likely to rise further as the Israel Defence Forces may soon enter the Gaza Strip.

In response to the Middle East tensions, investors who have already started turning to gold may increase their investments in the yellow metal, which is considered a safe haven asset during uncertain times.

Current gold rates in Hyderabad
Currently, the gold rates in Hyderabad are Rs 55,100 for 10 grams of 22-carat gold and Rs 60,110 for 10 grams of 24-carat gold.

Recently, the price of gold hit a six-month low, with rates for 10 grams of 22-carat and 24-carat gold dropping to Rs 52,600 and Rs 57,380, respectively.

The sharp rise in gold rates may impact jewelry sales during the upcoming festival season of Dhanteras and Diwali in Hyderabad.

Israeli army may soon enter Gaza
Media reports quote Israel Defence Forces‚Äô chief, who said that the army will soon enter the Gaza Strip to target Hamas.

IDF Chief of Staff Lt. General Herzi Halevi told troops in Southern Israel on Sunday, ‚ÄúOur responsibility now is to enter Gaza, go to the places where Hamas is preparing, acting, planning, and launching attacks. Target them everywhere, every commander, every operative, and destroy infrastructure.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Egypt is stepping up its military presence at its Rafah border crossing with Gaza, amid fears that Israel intends to push hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees across the border into the Sinai desert.

Due to the escalation of tension in the Middle East region, investors are concerned about volatility in global markets and have turned to gold, causing the rates of the yellow metal to rise not only in Hyderabad but also in other Indian cities and around the world.",,367,"{'like_count': 365, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 53867}",Hyderabad News Insta,,2023-10-16 12:22:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/319075348_834526007636091_7251464161281060085_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=R4r92QhOFH8AX8ybzhW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBUWv5yaI--VZn078AXWvIXLy1ycFd4-VVPmaUaDLkuWQ&oe=655A8132,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydaPxIrNJQ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391243355_845343480370203_1350130009647616181_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SX7A0LQdIz8AX-qGw6C&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDSB9PcQKYhhHVpcn0iHbbPYm1_AGO2LYvrYdpbuXUL1w&oe=65324E4C
instagram,"After Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, IDF forces responded with airstrikes, leveling Gazan buildings. The violence so far has claimed the lives of more than 2,500 people. Western media, however, show far more interest and have much greater sympathy with Israeli dead than Palestinian ones and have played their usual role as unofficial spokespersons for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS, ZERO EVIDENCE

One case in point is the claim that, during their incursion into southern Israel, Hamas fighters stopped to round up, kill and mutilate 40 Israeli babies, beheading them and leaving their bodies behind.

The extraordinary assertion was originally reported by the Israeli channel i24 News, which based it on anonymous Israeli military sources. Despite offering no proof whatsoever, this highly inflammatory claim about an enemy made by an active participant in a conflict was picked up and repeated across the world by a host of media (e.g., in the United States by¬†Fox News,¬†CNN,¬†MSN,¬†Business Insider, and¬†The New York Post).

Meanwhile, the front pages of the United Kingdom‚Äôs largest newspapers were¬†festooned¬†with the story, the press outraged at the atrocity and inviting their readers to feel the same way.

instagram,"Prof. Florence Nwapa, a celebrated novelist and often referred to as the mother of modern African Literature, pioneered a new era for African women writers. She holds the distinction of being the first African woman novelist to have her work published in the English language in Britain. Her debut novel, ""Efuru,"" published by Heinemann Educational Books in October 1966, catapulted her to international acclaim.

Nwapa was renowned for her portrayal of life and traditions from the perspective of Igbo women. In 1970, she took a significant step by founding Tana Press in Nigeria, making her one of the earliest African women publishers. Among her notable works are ""One is Enough,"" ""Women are different,"" ""Idu,"" ""Never Again,"" and ""Wives at war.""

Beyond her literary contributions, Nwapa engaged in post-war reconstruction efforts, focusing on aiding orphans and refugees who had been displaced during the conflict.

instagram,"A 71-year-old man from Illinois has been charged with a hate crime after allegedly fatally stabbing a 6-year-old boy and seriously injuring a 32-year-old woman. Police claim that he targeted the victims because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

The incident took place late Saturday morning in an unincorporated area of Plainfield Township, southwest of Chicago, as reported by the Will County Sheriff's Office. According to their statement, officers found the woman and the boy at a residence. 

In response to the increased threats, the Illinois State Police are communicating with federal law-enforcement and reaching out to Muslim communities and religious leaders to offer support, according to a Sunday press release from Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker.

President Joe Biden echoed that sentiment Sunday, saying in a statement: ‚ÄúThis horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.‚Äù

If Practical Magic and The House in the Cerulean Sea had a child with short chapters, you would get this book.

üìñ ‚Ä¢ The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches, other than being a super long book title, is a very twee novel about a lonely witch who finds herself teaching three young witches under strange circumstances.

üí≠ ‚Ä¢  While I enjoyed the wholesomeness of this book, I was left feeling rather split about it as a whole. There were definitely aspects of the story I enjoyed, like the whimsicalness of it all, the found family storyline, the guncles, and diverse characters. But I found other parts of the plot simply did not work, like the romance, forced conflict, and a certain character‚Äôs petulant man-child attitude.

However, the biggest issue I have with TVSSIW is its serious lack of depth. This novel failed to immerse me in any way. There was little world building or character development. In fact, there is little description at all. Instead, it is a very shallow story that was mostly filled with comfy vibes and little substance.

The worst example of TVSSIW all-vibes-and-little-else approach was the romance subplot. First, if you begin this book thinking it is a romance novel, you are going to be sorely disappointed. It is merely a subplot that feels like it was added in as an afterthought. There is no build-up, no tension, and absolutely no chemistry between the characters. Their attraction is just suddenly there on the page. Similarly, there is a sex scene that feels out of nowhere and completely out of character. Did I mention that it occurs after instantaneous forgiveness for actions that hit the character‚Äôs largest trauma? The romance, like the rest of the story, is a thinly veiled fairytale world where childhood trauma can disappear from a really good hug.

Now, I do not want to dissuade anyone from reading The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches. I just want to temper expectations so that all who pick it up can enjoy it.

instagram,"Why Gaza Depends on Global Aid for Survival?

More than 53 per cent of Gaza residents were considered below the poverty line in 2020, and about 77 per cent of Gazan households receive some form of aid from the United Nations and other groups, mostly in the form of cash or food.International aid groups are warning that they cannot deliver food and other basic services to people in the Gaza Strip and that a ‚Äúdire‚Äù humanitarian crisis is set to worsen.

International aid groups provide food and other means of support to about 63 percent of people in Gaza.

Israel stopped allowing deliveries of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza‚Äôs 2.3 million residents on Oct. 10, 2023, and is reportedly preparing for a ground invasion.

On Oct. 12, 2023, Israel warned 1.1 million Gaza residents in the northern section of the enclave to leave for the southern region, in advance of a potential ground invasion.

I am a scholar of peace and conflict economics and a former World Bank consultant, including during the 2014 war between Hamas and Israel.

International aid groups now face the same problem in Gaza that local businesses and residents have encountered for about 16 years: a blockade that prevents civilians and items, like medicine from easily moving into or out of the enclosed area, roughly 25 miles long. That 16-year blockade did not apply to the food and fuel that groups brought in to Gaza.

Now, it does.

Gaza‚Äôs blockade and economy

Gaza is about the size of Philadelphia and requires trade with different businesses and countries in order to maintain and grow its economy.

But Gaza is heavily dependent on foreign aid.

This is partially the result of Israel setting up permanent air, land and sea blockades around Gaza in 2007, one year after Hamas rose to political power. Egypt, which borders Gaza on its southern end, also oversees one checkpoint that specifically limits people coming and going.

Leyva described on X, formerly known as Twitter, the remarks by the Israeli Ambassador Gal Dagan in response to Petro as ""outrageously insane.""

President Gustavo Petro drew a comparison between Israel's ongoing attacks on Gaza and the persecution of Jews by the Nazis during World War II.

instagram,"If people truly care about Palestinians, they will support Israel in its overall effort to eliminate Hamas, so that they can finally be free from the terrorists who oppress them, who are actively trying to maximize civilian casualties.

According to the laws of war, Hamas is responsible for Palestinian civilian deaths. 

""When Hamas abandons the principle of distinction, then Hamas is responsible for the civilian damage that results. If Hamas fights from a hospital ‚Äî or stores munitions in a hospital ‚Äî damage to that hospital is Hamas‚Äôs responsibility. If Hamas fighters shoot at Israel Defense Forces from a home that contains a Palestinian family, then Hamas is responsible for the civilian casualties if that family is harmed in the resulting exchange of fire.""

instagram,"An Illinois man was charged with stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy to death and seriously injuring his mother in what police said was a hate crime linked to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East.

Joseph Czuba allegedly stabbed the boy 26 times with a ""military-style knife"" and his mother more than a dozen in the incident, which President Joe Biden said ""shocked and sickened"" him.

""The child's Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek‚Äîa refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace. This horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are,"" his statement continued.

The Justice Department opened a federal hate crimes investigation into the alleged murder of the boy, who was identified as Wadea Al-Fayoume, and wounding of his mother, Hanaan Shahin, according to a statement.

Local authorities said in a news release that the suspect, who is scheduled to be in court on Monday, stabbed the boy on Saturday in the Chicago suburb of Plainfield, Illinois.

On Saturday around 11:38 a.m. local time, deputies were sent to a residence near S. Lincoln Highway and responded to a call about a stabbing between a landlord and tenant.

The victims were found in the bedroom of a residence. Both victims had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso and upper extremities, authorities said.

The 32-year-old female was taken to the hospital in serious condition. She suffered from over a dozen stab wounds to her body and is expected to survive the attack, officials said.

The child, 6, was taken to the hospital in critical condition and succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead, the sheriff's department said.

Anyone, regardless of their ""reasoning/motivation,"" who hurts children isn't deserving of fair treatment. However, I also understand we live in a system of supposed balance, and this Tales from the Crypt looking MF still will have his day in court.

If this is all becoming too much for you, please disconnect from all forms of media and gather yourself, and condition your thoughts accordingly. 

The Story:
In a tragic incident that has shocked the community, an Illinois landlord has been arrested and charged with a hate crime after allegedly stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy to death and seriously injuring his mother. The man reportedly targeted the victims based on their faith and as a response to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
_________________________________________________ 
According to the Associated Press, a woman identified as Hanaan Shahin, had called 911 to report that her landlord had attacked her and her child with a knife. She told the operator that she ran into a bathroom and continued to fight him off. While arriving at the scene, officers found the 32-year-old wounded woman and little boy late Saturday morning at the home located in an unincorporated area of Plainfield Township. The man suspected, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba, was found outside the residence ‚Äúsitting upright on the ground near the driveway of the residence‚Äù with cuts on his face. From there he was immediately taken into police custody.
________________________________________________ 
The innocent little boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. The woman was seen for multiple stab wounds but is expected to survive, according to a statement. The autopsy revealed that the child had been stabbed a total of 26 times. The sheriff‚Äôs department said in a statement, ‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.",,303,"{'like_count': 280, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 58077}",Kevin Dixie,,2023-10-16 16:49:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/376685461_717467346889717_5479896983071448876_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=_8A1tclw2YgAX_fk5kT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC6TfxZGC-zxe20K19N65vaxgDn8tpGHuJ1w6D_V7A6Vw&oe=655A7AF4,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyd41c-Oj6M/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392945707_6678755605494749_1136034533011535618_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0OeM5GpbFUUAX9TuPoG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD6SN2UtNT3vqyVeksn_fG2EjBwx83QadfNbVg-CsFTiw&oe=655A3525

instagram,"What happened: Hopes for a brief pause in the ongoing conflict in southern Gaza, which was anticipated to permit foreign passport holders to leave the besieged Palestinian enclave and facilitate aid delivery, were shattered on Monday. Israeli airstrikes intensified as the prospect of a ground invasion loomed. Officials in Gaza reported that at least 2,750 Palestinians, including a quarter of them children, had lost their lives due to Israel's harsh retaliatory attacks, and nearly 10,000 people were wounded. An additional 1,000 individuals were missing, presumably trapped under debris.

Details: Gaza residents described the overnight bombings as the most severe in the nine days of conflict, resulting in numerous destroyed homes and an escalating death toll. Israeli aircraft targeted areas around Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City early on Monday, obstructing ambulance movement due to the ongoing airstrikes, as reported by Palestinian media.
Diplomatic initiatives had been in progress to facilitate humanitarian aid delivery into the besieged enclave, which had been enduring relentless Israeli bombings since October 7.

What you need to know: Earlier on Monday, Egyptian security sources had informed Reuters that an agreement was reached to open the border crossing for aid entry into Gaza. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office refuted these claims, stating, ""There is currently no ceasefire and no humanitarian aid in Gaza in exchange for evacuating foreigners.""

‚ÄúWe have seen that the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Israel is doing a good job.

However, there is much to be done where Sri Lanka is concerned,‚Äù SJB National Organizer Tissa Attanayake said.

‚ÄúThere are a large number of Sri Lankans working in Gaza and in Israel. Sri Lanka could face an issue when it comes to collecting remittances. Sri Lanka could therefore suffer a fresh forex issue. Also, there is a possibility of fuel and gas price hikes soon. The government might even use this opportunity to increase fuel and gas prices,‚Äù he added.

It was possible to simply refer to the genre of the double #portrait, even though in most cases taken as an example here, only a woman with multiplied features is portrayed. In fact, I could speak of four portraits of a woman, which actually become eight, even though they mainly immortalize the same subject.

We can refer to the concepts of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mood swings, inner conflict, sometimes even just mentioning the dual signs of the zodiac, or to be more precise, to the ever-changing nature of humans, predisposed to change following the best opportunity or sensation...

All the multiple facets of the #human being have been mentioned to promote awareness, openness, and tolerance towards the weaknesses of our soul, our mind, and our heart.

instagram,"Dear @KachiAmbitious,

Thank you for your feedback. Please can you, in a few words, state the criminal offence that I have committed for which I should be imprisoned? I was wealthy before I was appointed by President Jonathan. I was investigated down to my underwear by the Buhari administration and found clean. I visited Nigeria twice under Buhari. I was in Nigeria three months ago. 

I have never been detained at Heathrow Airport or any airport in any country in the world. My name is not in Pandora Papers as a criminal who illegally stashed money in tax havens. I did not commit the misdemeanour of conflict of interest by putting state government funds in a bank where I have significant shares. So, exactly why should I be in prison?

Kachi, this is the type of Nigeria you want. A Nigeria where anyone who does not support your Presidential candidate and has views that differ with your movement is thrown in prison. 

If you and those you represent ever get power, I shudder to think of what Nigeria will become. Critics will either disappear or be in jail. May God, in His infinite Wisdom, NEVER allow power at the federal level to touch your hand or those you represent. In Yeshua's Name, I pray. Tufiakwa! Never, never, never!!!

Highly sought after conflict photographer, relationship-averse Marley Cunningham thrives on adrenaline and the chaos of her nomadic life. But when the passion for her career starts to wane, she decides a hike far from the noise of life is the best way to shake the doubts from her mind and focus on what she wants. Spraining her ankle and being rescued by a handsome stranger and his pack of dogs is not part of the plan.

Big-hearted, reclusive Bennett Morgan has spent his life with two main goals, play professional football for a few years and then pursue medicine. Shortly after his football career begins, a catastrophic diagnosis shatters both goals in one fell swoop. Feeling lost for the first time, he packed up his life and two dogs and returned to the home he couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. It‚Äôs in the shadow of his past that he finds joy in starting a dog sanctuary.

After a rainstorm washes away the road to Bennett‚Äôs home, he is shocked to find Marley injured and alone on the secluded trail he walks the dogs on daily. From the moment she is hoisted onto his back, Marley is drawn in by Bennett‚Äôs kindness, strength, and calm nature. Bennett quickly realizes that a bit more human connection in his life might not be such a bad thing, especially when that human is beautiful, courageous, and complicated, Marley.

Through the patience and care of Bennett, Marley begins to explore her feelings for not just her career but to her shock, the man who rescued her. Bennett, on the other hand, must decide if embracing the present with Marley is worth it, even if the future is uncertain.

instagram,"In an interview with Le Monde, Rabbi Delphine Horvilleur, a voice for liberal Judaism in France, recounts how she experienced the terrorist attack of Hamas in Israel from Paris.

I could speak as a Jew or as someone connected to Israel, of course. But in reality, I simply have to speak as a human being. We are confronted with images of such inhumanity that the question that fills my mind is how to preserve our humanity, how to make sure that, in the times to come, we don't dehumanize the other to a degree that would confiscate our souls.

Some silences have left me devastated. Particularly that of certain friends, supporters of the Palestinian cause and incapable of clearly denouncing Hamas. Their silence is unbearable. When I see that none of the Palestinian leaders I know in France is capable of strongly condemning the Hamas murders, I lose hope, it's true.

I feel that many people are ideologically imprisoned, held captive by their silence, and by the criminal ideology of Hamas and its allies. So they decide to keep their mouths shut, to relativize or contextualize the situation in obscene ways ‚Äì absolving the murderers by simply mentioning colonization. 

And they keep the truth to themselves: Hamas does not want peace or a return to the negotiation table. It aspires only to the destruction of Israel, not to an end to the occupation of the West Bank. For this organization, any Jewish presence ‚Äì I deliberately say ""Jewish"" and not ""Israeli"" ‚Äì on this land is to be exterminated. 

Failing to denounce this is a terrible moral failing for the Palestinian narrative, which deserves better than this indelible pool of blood on its flag. This terrorist movement must be condemned, not in spite of some people's attachment to Palestine, but precisely in the name of that attachment.

instagram,"A six year old Muslim boy was stabbed and killed by his family‚Äôs landlord in what is alleged to be a hate crime related to the Israel Hamas war, according to the Will County Sheriff‚Äôs Office in Plainfield, Illinois. 

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs statement said.

Officials say the boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, was stabbed 26 times and was pronounced dead at the hospital. The landlord also attacked his mother, who is currently receiving medical care.

According to relatives, the family is Palestinian American. The attack comes as cities across the U.S. are increasing security in response to fears of antisemitic or Islamophobic attacks.

The boy‚Äôs father, Odey Al-Fayoume, told the Daily Beast, ‚ÄúI keep thinking that my son was probably running towards him before getting stabbed, trying to give him a hug.‚Äù

instagram,"According to legend, the origins of the prayer flag can be traced back to Gautama Buddha, whose prayers were inscribed on battle flags used by the benevolent devas in their conflict against their foes, the demonic asuras. This tale might have provided Buddhist monastics with a rationale for bearing these banners, symbolising their dedication to the non-violent principle of ahimsa. In Bhutan and all over the Himalayas, prayer flags, banners and poles dot the mountain landscape, spreading the essence of prayers around the world on the wind.

instagram,"This modern world is great in some ways, and very problematic in others (üá™üá∏ Espa√±ol en subt√≠tulo).

We can at least partially blame social media for this.

Comparison (to others or to your past self) is a thief of joy and happiness. üòî

The Fitness Industry is really bad for this. üëéüèº

We live in a world where more than ever, people seek:

‚ö†Ô∏è Attention,
‚ö†Ô∏è External Validation,
‚ö†Ô∏è Instant Gratification.

I believe that world creates people who feel a certain emptiness inside. 

I experienced that personally, and thankfully temporarily.

In 2019-2020, I was doing tonnes of modelling and my content strategy heavily leaned into that (and lots of shirtless posts ü§£).

Why? More engagement. My account grew faster than ever.

Although I AM proud with what I‚Äôve done with professional modelling‚Ä¶

This content strategy created a HUGE internal conflict in me. It made me become so self critical. üò∞

Although I AM confident in my appearance, I am NOT comfortable with using my appearance as a *primary* strategy to push engagement.üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

As you can tell, now I hardly post this type of photos and only show up shirtless in the context of fitness progress updates (completely unedited without filters, by the way).

Because, what I believe ACTUALLY matters to being happy in this crazy modern world is:

‚úÖ Genuine Connections,
‚úÖ Authenticity,
‚úÖ Purpose.

When you‚Äôve got these things in your life‚Ä¶you‚Äôre living the truth. üíØ

Now, smash that like button to tell the IG algorithm what‚Äôs up üòÇ

instagram,"I've wanted to post something about atrocities that are happening in Gaza & Israel for days now. But I just don't quite know what to say. I feel like there's nothing I can say that will be right.

I've had a lot of messages on social media from people calling me scared & worse for not showing my support for Palestine or Israel. But I'm not scared, I have never been afraid to stand up for what I think is right. I am however woefully ignorant on this entire situation & for that I am ashamed. I've spent the last couple of days trying to understand more as I wanted to speak on something so devastating & important from a place of knowledge rather than ignorance. 

But it's just left me feeling numb. I am heartbroken for the people of Israel- The Hamas attack that left thousands dead & took scores of hostages was both senseless & cruel. And I am beyond heartbroken for the people of Palestine. Thousands of innocent men, women & children who are caught up in this devastating & deadly conflict. Around 3000 already dead & 10,000 wounded. The horrors that are unfolding in Gaza are a tragedy & I can't believe we live in a world where this retaliation is justifiable.

Caught up in all this hate & anger are innocent people, innocent children- it's them who suffer the most. We cannot sit idly by while this unfolds. We are not powerless. There are things we can be doing to help the people of Palestine & Israel. I have compiled a list of organisations that are currently on the ground helping those displaced, hurt & in need of aid. I will provide links & more information on my Instagram stories for anyone interested. 

- @unicef are in Gaza providing life-saving humanitarian support. Medical equipment, food, fuel & access to safe drinking water. As little as ¬£39 could provide a family with an emergency water & hygiene kit. 

- @afhcharity's team is on the ground ensuring that all people have access to assistance. Providing emergency aid, food & medical care and shelter. ¬£300 will get a homeless family a shelter voucher.

- @ifrc (Red Cross) are providing humanitarian assistance as required on BOTH sides.

instagram,"Egypt‚Äôs President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Russian President Vladimir Putin affirmed the need to prioritize the protection of civilians in Gaza and the prevention of targeting them.

In a phone call, Sisi and Putin highlighted the gravity of the humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and the necessity of providing safe access to humanitarian and relief aid urgently.

Sisi and Putin reviewed diplomatic efforts underway to contain the situation and prevent the expansion of the violence and conflict, which jeopardizes security and stability in the region.

They highlighted the necessity of addressing the causes of the current crisis.

This comes amid the continued absence of political prospects to settle the Palestinian cause in a fair and lasting manner to establish the Palestinian state in accordance with the agreed-upon terms of reference of international legitimacy, the presidents affirmed.

instagram,"I would rather not talk about these things on this platform, I haven't known what to say for the last week, and I still don't. I have no wisdom to add, and am drawn to keep my thoughts private to protect my heart, but I feel like I need to address the ongoing horrors in Israel and Gaza because it is weighing heavily on so many of us.

For a little background on my perspective, I spent almost two years living in Israel before and during college. One of those years I spent studying at an institute in the southern desert whose goal was to bring together Jewish and Arab Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians, and Jews and non-Jews from all over the world to study environmental studies as a bridge to regional cooperation and understanding. Their slogan was ""Nature knows no borders."" My time there inspired my dual major in Middle East Studies and Environmental Policy, focusing on water scarcity conflict, and it was also the basis of so many beautiful relationships and so much perspective. The intensity of having all of the hard conversations with people on every side of the Isreali-Palestinian conflict was so bonding. We were all there to focus on common goals and shared concerns, knowing that no solutions to any of the regional (or global) environmental crises would be successful unless all of the region's players were working together. The people I met there were so inspiring. Coming from all backgrounds, all kinds of struggles, differing levels of education, but all with a strong passion for the environment and for peace. I know that a lot of them still feel a strong love for one another, from their homes in the West Bank, Israel, the US, and other far-flung places, even when their people are at war, and that both bolsters and breaks my heart.

Now that I live in Vermont, far from any immediate water scarcity and from the intensity of constant conflict and tension between neighboring cultures, all I can say is this:

If you think you know who is ""right"" in this conflict, there is probably more complexity to it than you are considering.

instagram,"Herzlichen Gl√ºckwunsch! Congratulations!
Did you know Columbia International University has a European campus in Korntal, Germany? And like any other college campus, they like to celebrate graduation ceremonies.

That‚Äôs why CIU Interim President Dr. Rick Christman and CIU Provost Dr. James Lanpher traveled to Korntal, a suburb of Stuttgart, to be a part of an October commencement.

The Korntal campus is known in Europe as AWM or Academy World Mission. Their motto is:

Your Academy.

Our World.

God‚Äôs Mission.

The campus provides theological, intercultural and professional training for those in full-time church ministry or professionals desiring theological training, bringing together a diverse group of students united in the desire to be part of God's mission in our own sphere of influence.

There were 53 students receiving degrees at the commencement; 16 students graduated from Conflict Transformation and Systemic Organizational Development training courses while 37 earned a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS), or a bachelor's or a master's diploma. About half of the graduates were on campus for the event, the other half were mostly already on assignment around the world.

Over 100 invited guests gathered for the commencement including Alexander Noak, the mayor of Korntal.

Tobias Menges, dean of  CIU Korntal, discussed the value of a theological diploma: Although the study itself inspires and qualifies, the actual value only becomes apparent in applying what has been learned. Because studying also shapes a person and character, it enables a new self-image. Following the words of the Apostle Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians, those completing the course should see themselves as ‚Äútrustees‚Äù of what God has entrusted to them. 

CIU‚Äôs history with AWM dates back to 1995 when CIU‚Äôs seminary became the first in the United States to offer an accredited theological degree in Europe with no U.S. residency requirement.",,229,"{'like_count': 229, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 4161}",Columbia International Univ.,,2023-10-16 17:00:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/313966032_858602492234550_211449216987785518_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SXGyHvlbWiAAX8HVt0V&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBvXB8GtRebI9c5gJpjVJbz-RT0JiKVKdtUqzxROK_2cg&oe=655A4D7C,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyd6EHeSDJT/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/392940553_707309698109677_7124618260073690879_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=jtZAYqT2Fn0AX9Gtmht&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBvuPMFLI2SCHQZy5M0SpmKD2ZRO3zMIiwxy7ecH-jtpA&oe=655A52A2

instagram,"I‚Äôm lying on the couch, scrolling along today‚Äôs pictures of my gorgeous Amelie who turned 3 ü©∑ I love you my precious treasure, you teach me so much every day. You are always doing things differently and I am here to learn from you and love you unconditionally. And I am grateful that we had a good day, filled with friends, love, calm and safety.

I have to say also that my heart is absolutely torn apart. Trying to be present for my kids, go about life as usual, work focus and family routine has been nothing short of ridiculously hard while watching the destruction of families and lives in the East. It is unbearable to me to think of the kids especially caught in conflict, freaking clinging on for dear life to their parents, brothers, sisters or whoever has taken their tiny hand and trying to find any where AT ALL that they can feel safe. Then it breaks for said parents or family members who also have no idea if they can keep anyone they love safe. And my heart breaks and breaks and breaks all over again for every single pure soul whose life has been taken, torn, traumatized and turned upside down. I‚Äôm reminded how lucky I am that I do not remotely know what that reality is and yet it feels like an invisible string attaches me to those people who are walking that path.

And so I hang on tighter to my family this week, somehow thinking that helps. I don‚Äôt have a clue what to do or how to help. Like, if I could fill up my house with those people who are escaping war zones and devastation, I would in the blink of an eye.

1. Palestinian militias continued drone and indirect fire attacks into Israel, primarily southern Israel. CTP-ISW did not record any reports of infiltrations or small arms clashes in southern Israel.

2. The rate of small arms clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants has continued to fall after peaking on October 13.

3. Lebanese #Hezbollah (LH) expanded its campaign against Israeli forces along the Israel-#Lebanon border in terms of pace, location, and actors involved. The IDF spokesperson stated that Iran has instructed LH to escalate against Israel and thereby impose pressure on the IDF while it prepares for ground operations into the #Gaza Strip.

4. The IDF conducted an airstrike on #Syria's #Aleppo International Airport, marking the second time that the IDF has struck this location since the war began on October 7.

5. #Iran and elements of its Axis of Resistance are messaging that the #Hamas-Israel war could expand geographically into a multi-front conflict. CTP-ISW is closely monitoring the situation to forecast whether such a scenario is becoming more or less likely.

Aisha was born in Yemen and she is 29 years old. 
She studied medical research and development with the specific goal of improving the living conditions of those born in places devastated by conflict, poverty and war. 
Aisha believes that the health of an individual is the result of physical and psychological well-being. To care for others means to ensure they receive quality education, psychological support, adequate hygienic and sanitary conditions and that they live in safe and comfortable spaces.

In Yemen, a country torn by a very long conflict, this is urgent and we need to start protecting TODAY vulnerable children who will be the adults of TOMORROW.

With this dream in her heart, Aisha has joined Still I Rise as our Program Manager for Yemen. Her knowledge and her experience are exactly what we need to build a new dream together.

instagram,"Maltese literary groups have decried a decision to revoke a Palestinian author‚Äôs award amid the brutal conflict that erupted between Israel and Palestine.

Inizjamed, PEN Malta and HELA Foundation voice their protest against the ‚Äúunacceptable revocation‚Äù of a German literary award to Adania Shibli, a Palestinian-born writer whose novel, Minor Detail, was meant to be awarded on 20 October.

‚ÄúAt a time when we need to hear more, not less Palestinian voices and stories of the root causes of the ongoing catastrophe in Gaza and in Israel, the decision by the Frankfurt Book Fair to cancel the award to Shibli is morally wrong and a direct affront to our strongly held value of freedom of speech,‚Äù a statement read.

 The award was given by LitProm association, the German literary association responsible for the prize. LiBeraturpreis is a German literature prize awarded each year to a writer from Africa, Asia, Latin America, or the Arab world during the Frankfurt Book Fair, one of the largest publishing industry gatherings on a global scale.

Adania Shibli is a Palestinian-born writer who has penned novels, plays, short stories, and narrative essays and has won several awards and nominations.

Adania Shibli was a guest writer at the Malta Mediterranean Literature Festival 2023 held last August in Fort St Elmo, Valletta. The writer was interviewed by Adrian Grima and spoke about the short story ‚ÄúThis Sea is Mohammad al-Khatib‚Äôs‚Äù as well as her other notable novels.

As quoted by Deutsche Welle, LitProm association claims that Shibli‚Äôs novel was a ‚Äúrigorously composed work of art that tells of the power of borders and of what violent conflicts make of people‚Äù and thus was going to award her with a prize that honours women writers from the Global South for newly published works in the German language.

This prize was never short of controversy heightened by the current bombings which started this October.

(English below)
üïØÔ∏èEl otro d√≠a mi hijo (7 a√±os) me pregunt√≥ mientras ve√≠amos las noticias  sobre la guerra entre Israel y Palestina: ‚ÄúMami, a qui√©n le vas?‚Äù
üïØÔ∏èLe dije: Ojal√° fueran tan f√°cil como en un partido de football‚Ä¶ Le voy a La Paz‚Äù le respond√≠.
üïØÔ∏èLo cierto es que un conflicto con tanta historia y hechos de por medio no deber√≠a de ser ligeramente abordado por nadie que no haya investigado.
üïØÔ∏èEst√° claro que, a este punto, el sufrimiento de ambas partes es insoportable y una resoluci√≥n final a esta lucha deber√≠a de ser la prioridad de ambos bandos y de la comunidad internacional‚Ä¶ Esto tiene que acabar‚Ä¶
üïØÔ∏èComo descendiente de un sobreviviente jud√≠o de la Segunda Guerra Mundial (mi abuelo Ernest Laufer) y c√≥mo portadora de genes y ra√≠ces jud√≠o-ashkenazi, y una buena parte de mi vida dedicada a la Teshuva y al enriquecimiento de mi #neshama a trav√©s de la pr√°ctica, estoy profundamente conmovida. 
üïØÔ∏èPero no estoy aqu√≠ para posicionarme a favor de un bando o del otro‚Ä¶solo deseo La Paz desde lo m√°s profundo d mi alma.

üïØÔ∏èIt is clear that, at this point, the suffering on both sides is unbearable and a final resolution should be the priority of both sides and the international community...
üïØÔ∏èAs a descendant of a Jewish survivor of World War II (my grandfather Ernest Laufer) and as a carrier of Ashkenazi-Jewish genes and roots, and a good part of my life dedicated to the enrichment of my #neshama through practice of the #teshuva I am deeply moved.
üïØÔ∏èBut I am not here to position myself in favor of one side or the other... I only wish for Peace.

There was a lot of support for the Palestinian cause in Chicago this weekend. It was really uplifting to see thousands of people standing against the criminal actions of the Israeli state and the ridiculous media narrative about the conflict.

instagram,"Belgi√´ maakt 2 miljoen euro extra vrij voor humanitaire hulp in Gaza. Deze hulp is van groot belang want de noden op het terrein nemen uur na uur toe. Er is een tekort aan drinkwater, voedsel, elektriciteit en medicijnen. Honderdduizenden mensen zijn op de vlucht voor het geweld.

De Belgische steun gaat naar de hulporganisatie van de Verenigde Naties. Zij organiseren en co√∂rdineren de hulpverlening aan de slachtoffers in Gaza. Ze zetten medische hulpposten op, verdelen voedsel en water, en bieden onderdak aan degenen die hun huizen zijn ontvlucht.

Ik wil ook mijn oproep herhalen tot het respecteren van het internationale humanitaire recht. Alle betrokken partijen moeten onschuldige burgers ontzien en beschermen, en humanitaire hulp mogelijk maken. 
Ik blijf er ook bij dat een onderhandelde tweestatenoplossing op lange termijn de enige weg vooruit is. Stop het geweld en ga rond de onderhandelingstafel zitten, want de prijs in dit conflict wordt aan beide zijden betaald door onschuldige mensen.

The other challenge for their conservation is the complex human-carnivore relationships. Snow leopards are increasingly coming into conflict with humans due to change in herding practices in the Himalayan region. The herding practices are changing due to glacial melting impacting the availability of water resources.

For over forty years, the Rebbe served as a source of inspiration and guidance to the Jews of Israel. During peace and conflict, he navigated the Jewish people through advesity and calm.

Over these past few days, hundreds of thousands have taken strength from the Rebbe's ""inspirational"" messages, but far fewer are famliar with the Rebbe's full vision for how Israel can experience victory and a long-term peace.

In a new video, Rabbi Elkanah Shmotkin, JEM's director lays out what he calls, ""the results of twenty-five years of study of the Rebbe's approach to Israel's security.""

Aiming to present the Rebbe's opinion in as succinct and uncomplicated a presentation as possible, JEM Presents: The Rebbe's Three Steps to Victory manages to present the Rebbe's views for Israel's security in one short video.

instagram,"Today in 1859, John Brown‚Äôs Raid on Harpers Ferry begins. This is considered to be one of the final triggering events of the American Civil War. Prior to Harpers Ferry, Brown had been a participant of the Midwestern border conflict, known as Bleeding Kansas. During this, violent clashes were fought between anti-slavery Jayhawks and pro-slavery Border Ruffians, in an effort to establish Kansas as either free or slave territory. It was here that Brown led a militia to Pottawatomie Creek, which resulted in a massacre of five pro-slavery settlers, following the Sacking of Lawrence, Kansas, by Border Ruffians from Missouri. Three years later, Brown led a militia to Harpers Ferry, located at the junction of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers, in the mountains of what is now West Virginia. His goal was to incite a slave uprising, which he hoped would then spread throughout the south. A free Black man - Heyward Shepherd - was the first casualty of the incident, killed by Brown‚Äôs forces. Most of Brown‚Äôs men were later captured or killed by US Marines under the command of Colonel Robert E. Lee. Brown himself surrendered after being trapped in an engine house. He was sentenced to death and executed on December 2, 1859. #todayinhistory #history",,182,"{'like_count': 182, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 14195}",Garrett Smith,,2023-10-16 13:25:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/343281456_1262780097956508_2976504686011375395_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=d3v-9VXrskYAX_eXm5w&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAVUAu17GmX07TBKcapwBaezsiXwo50wk_6iV4a_Cda1g&oe=655AA65A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydhgYxuAOi/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392952013_656002989932919_5645218499405671754_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=iS_kTcKzkYIAX9E7UEp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBM64s7Vzz1V7vc8Hwl6Q0j7Ju98fBAqDaB1jPtNnueXA&oe=653CF184
instagram,"IRAN: READY TO JOIN WAR AGAINST ISRAEL: Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned that Iran would enter the Hamas-Israel war unless Israel halted its attacks on Gaza.
* Amir-Abdollahian made the comments at a joint press conference with Lebanon‚Äôs acting foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, in Beirut on Sunday.
* Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to ‚Äúdemolish Hamas‚Äù as his military prepared to move into the Gaza Strip.
* Why It Matters: It is highly unlikely that Israel will halt its military response to the Hamas raid that killed over 1300 Israeli civilians last weekend. Israel cannot afford to allow a return to the status quo ante regarding Hamas, and its retaliatory move into Gaza will probably result in Iran and Hezbollah entering the fight. Syrian officials reported on Sunday that Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah forces had left their bases in eastern Syria and were moving south towards Israel‚Äôs northern border. These forces would be likely targets for U.S. carrier strike groups in the eastern Mediterranean, as the Department of Defense is reportedly prepared to interdict any third-party military forces attempting to enter the conflict. ‚Äì M.M.

instagram,"After Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel responded with a declaration of war, disagreements over the ongoing conflict loom large on social media and at rallies worldwide. In Seattle, Muslims and Jews mourned, protested and shared the fear that heightened Islamophobia and anti-Semitism could lead to hate crimes. 

On Tuesday, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch Sinai called ‚ÄúA Vigil for Israel: In Support, Solidarity & Hope,‚Äù where hundreds of community members were joined by religious leaders, elected officials and heightened security for the vigil. On Thursday, several hundred students and others gather at the ‚ÄúDay of Resistance: Protest for Palestine‚Äù rally at the University of Washington to show support for Palestinians.

But both communities across Western Washington also share ‚Äî and understand ‚Äî the generations of trauma from centuries of religious persecution. Ilyas Mohammed, president of the Islamic Society of Southwest Washington in Vancouver, said that both Muslims and Jews can share in the pain, anguish and suffering that innocent Jews and Palestinians face daily.

‚ÄúWe can feel each other‚Äôs pain,‚Äù he said. Read more at the link in bio.

‚ÄúEveryone has the right to freedom of movement, but many do not have the choice.‚Äù
 This heartfelt message was at the core of the #Palestinian_Marathon, organized by the ""Palestinian Welfare Association"" in 2014 and sponsored by #KhalafAhmadAlHabtoorFoundation, out of our belief in human rights and the imperative of supporting the #Palestinian people. We aimed to amplify their voices on a global scale and bring attention to their plight.

The marathon was themed as ""The Right to Freedom of Movement,"" a message we strongly believe in and desire to convey to the world. Our goal was to shed light on the constraints placed on the freedom of movement in #Palestine and underscore the daily challenges that the Palestinians encounter in their pursuit of fundamental rights.

Our dedication to upholding human rights and unwavering support for the Palestinian people remain resolute. I urge all individuals with the means and influence to join us in raising awareness about this issue. Together, we can exert pressure on the international community to take action and bring an end to the heart-wrenching conflict that continues to afflict our hearts.",,178,"{'like_count': 170, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 72619}",KAH Life Journey,,2023-10-16 06:02:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/347222099_274457408291470_4065532630255870077_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=uJTvt-sAcsQAX88GdbW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA0JedzT4keQWNXJwIb2UWGhk3WjqxhpE9pXKQaUFzo8g&oe=655B403D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CycuyMVJF8p/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391287929_273544065663310_4407126245757578076_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=IJA8RpLOQFYAX-faiZC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBBH0z_bHIpCtjoX1hGojNxRwn7wInu8O7JoesQtIyepA&oe=654773D4

instagram,"Perhaps among the bees, peaceful and well-organized social creatures that they are, American confessional poet Sylvia Plath found a solid sense of community, support, and connection that she was missing on the home front. Add to that the affective element of hereditary nostalgia‚ÄîPlath‚Äôs late father, Otto Plath, was a respected biologist who published a book in 1934 on the habits of bumblebees‚Äîand what was produced was a series of poems that are notably more grounded and less volatile than anything she ever wrote about her father‚Äôs early death from diabetes or the abysmal health care she received for her lifelong mental illness.

Sylvia Plath‚Äôs healthy relationship with bees and their impact on her work in times of debilitating writer‚Äôs block could even be described as that of a genius and their muse. She was a beekeeper herself and likely composed poems in her head while interacting with her bees and absorbing their conflict-free productivity. Pun fully intended, they gave her a much-needed buzz.

Academics seem inclined to refer to the fruit of Plath‚Äôs labors‚Äîthe writing, not the beekeeping‚Äîsimply as ‚Äúthe bee poems,‚Äù giving them something of a distinction for having more neatly constructed narratives than her other output. Indeed, there was a narrative being told by a writer who may have had a touch of Beatrix Potter in her. Plath reportedly wanted a selection of her ‚Äúbee poems‚Äù published in a specific sequence at the end of her collection Ariel, but she passed away from suicide before she could give the editors and publishers proper instructions. Her estranged husband, Ted Hughes, who was not such a devoted beekeeper and seemingly didn‚Äôt understand her vision, published the collection incorrectly in 1965, ending the volume with her death-themed poems instead. Where Plath saw order in the natural world, he saw disorder. And it was, by all accounts, not the first time in their marriage that his will had overruled her own.

instagram,"PBBM CONDOLES WITH FAMILY OF THIRD FILIPINO FATALITY IN ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR
 
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has expressed condolences to the family of Loreta Villarin Alacre, the third Filipino who was killed in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas.
 
The Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said the President spoke with the relatives of Alacre via a phone call on Sunday.
 
During their phone conversation, President Marcos assured that necessary assistance would be given to Alacre‚Äôs family.
 
He also promised the immediate repatriation of her remains as soon as a humanitarian corridor will be opened for affected civilians.
 
Alacre, a 49-year old caregiver working in Haifa and Tel Aviv, was among the Filipinos earlier reported missing when Hamas militants attacked Israel from the Gaza strip.
 
The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) earlier said it has already notified Alacre‚Äôs family about the victim‚Äôs demise.
 
‚ÄúMay assistance para sa pamilya, pero lahat ng kailangang gawin para maiuwi na (ang iyong kapatid) ay gagawin na muna namin. Iyon lamang, hinihintay muna natin kung ano ‚Äòyung magiging sitwasyon doon sa Israel dahil talagang napakagulo masyado ngayon at sarado lahat,‚Äù President Marcos told Alacre‚Äôs sibling.
 
‚ÄúTulungan ka namin. Basta‚Äôt nandito ang gobyerno. Lahat ng mga embassy natin naka-alert naman, alam nila ang sitwasyon mo ‚Ä¶ lahat nga gusto nang umuwi kaya ‚Äòyun na muna ang inayos namin at basta‚Äôt mabigyan tayo ng pagkakataon ay iuuwi na namin silang lahat,‚Äù he added. 
 
The other Filipino fatalities were identified as Angeline Aguirre, a nurse, and Paul Vincent Castelvi, a caregiver.
 
President Marcos said the Philippine Embassy in Egypt is now waiting for the positive feedback for possible opening of a humanitarian corridor so that the government can start with the repatriation efforts.
 
The President also said that the airport in Tel Aviv, Israel is still open but it is not yet allowing refugees.
 
The Philippine government is coordinating efforts with the Israeli government to allow the repatriation of affected Filipinos, he added. ‚Äì RRD",,172,"{'like_count': 172, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 118432}",UNTV News and Rescue,,2023-10-16 09:03:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/298329121_1242299579880757_3315446861567386076_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ooavrpmtUHEAX83rMla&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB9dEIK7OhZTK8Z2qjvoj2u84lKvfh5dIEYs9G_0C9hgA&oe=655A3B6B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydDgz7tSNK/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/393404432_727002686135129_3749146088620093696_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=VE3Jw41TbvkAX9Sp4BS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB3RPPPePdg032aV18VEe8QF359Bwc6ODovFXUBhNCHVw&oe=653482CC

Can‚Äôt make it on the 25th? Our exhibits will be open and viewable year-round during normal business hours on the first floor of the City of Boston Archival Center at 201 Rivermoor Street.

instagram,"Ahtisaari served the Namibian people with flying colours ‚Äì Geingob

Staff Reporter

PRESIDENT Hage Geingob has said that Finland‚Äôs former President, Martti Ahtisaari, who played a pivotal role in facilitating the birth of an independent Namibia, served the Namibian people, who were seeking self-determination and justice, with flying colours. 

The message comes in the wake of Ahtisaari's death, who passed away at the age of 86 on 16th October 2023. Recounting the history of Ahtisaari, Geingob said that in 1989, Ahtisaari was appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General to undertake the challenging task of leading the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia, which was globally praised as a model for dealing with complex transitions from conflict to peace.

‚ÄúI have learned with utmost sadness about the passing of the former President of Finland, H.E. Martti Ahtisaari, a friend of the Namibian liberation struggle and a leading peacemaker who played a pivotal role through the United Nations in facilitating the birth of a new Namibia. The history of Martti Athissari is incomplete without Namibia, a country he was associated with in the many roles that he held,‚Äù Geingob said.

Synopsisüëá
Highly sought after conflict photographer, relationship-averse Marley Cunningham thrives on adrenaline and the chaos of her nomadic life. But when the passion for her career starts to wane, she decides a hike far from the noise of life is the best way to shake the doubts from her mind and focus on what she wants. Spraining her ankle and being rescued by a handsome stranger and his pack of dogs is not part of the plan.
Big-hearted, reclusive Bennett Morgan has spent his life with two main goals, play professional football for a few years and then pursue medicine. Shortly after his football career begins, a catastrophic diagnosis shatters both goals in one fell swoop. Feeling lost for the first time, he packs up his life and two dogs and returns to the home he couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. It‚Äôs in the shadow of his past that he finds joy in starting a dog sanctuary.
After a rainstorm washes away the road to Bennett‚Äôs home, he is shocked to find Marley injured and alone on the secluded trail he walks the dogs on daily. From the moment she is hoisted onto his back, Marley is drawn in by Bennett‚Äôs kindness, strength and calm nature. Bennett quickly realizes that a bit more human connection in his life might not be such a bad thing, especially when that human is beautiful, courageous, complicated, Marley.
Through the patience and care of Bennett, Marley begins to explore her feelings for not just her career but to her shock, the man who rescued her. Bennett, on the other hand, must decide if embracing the present with Marley is worth it, even if the future is uncertain.",,157,"{'like_count': 126, 'comment_count': 31, 'num_users': 6810}",WhitneyBlanche Reads,,2023-10-16 23:40:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/190579354_299746411827562_162226778907064618_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=QtjHsm4S6jUAX_7oT8F&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA35Ps0J7LRL1XNzxW1eSXixnv2NfY0yO1ne-_VAxkesA&oe=6559BADE,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyen3qBLpLX/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391428825_1407317216530092_4515645717686646771_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=s7R529Y2BMsAX_RyuMF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBXRh1s5sY0kYNJPQLM6IV_PBWb6c-GMQnAeHxeD04RVA&oe=655A35D7
instagram,"A Chicago-area landlord was arrested and charged with murder and hate crimes after authorities said he stabbed and killed a 6-year-old boy and seriously wounded his mother, allegedly because the tenants are Muslim.

Joseph M. Czuba, 71, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of a hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the Will County, Illinois, Sheriff‚Äôs Office said in a news release. The US Justice Department has also opened a federal hate crime investigation into the attack, US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Sunday.

instagram,"These pictures are from #Sderot, the Negev city only one kilometer away from the #Gaza strip. I took them in 2010, five years after Israel handed Gaza over to the Palestinians, three years after #Hamas took charge, thirteen years before the horrors of #october7

Back then we were a small group of European journalists who had been invited by @ajc.global to join #projectinterchange, a program to provide different perspectives, to help understand the context, the nuances. 

There is very little nuance about shelves piled with rusted remains of #Qassam rockets or about the many bus-stop-bunkers in Sderot. And there is none whatsoever in the mass slaughter of civilians and desecration of soldiers‚Äô bodies.

And yet, while we are still under the impression of babies murdered for no other reason than being Jewish babies, the ‚ÄúYes, but Israel‚Ä¶‚Äù rhetoric is still omnipresent. A little less audible maybe, but for how long?
It's not just the malignant and/or ignorant candy-mob. Many intellectual apologists, hypocrites, whataboutists and other #usefulidiots are already at work, trying to justify the unjustifiable. 

With #Israel now involved in a long and bitter war that will cost even more innocent lives, when will public discourse engage in moral relativism again?

It is already creeping through, in terminology or lack thereof, by not saying which side is which. Broadcasters described Hamas terrorists as fighters, militants, even activists. As if the carnage proudly presented by Hamas showed valiant partisans.
And only a day after the mass murder in the kibbutzim, in living rooms and at the music festival we heard calls addressing ""both sides"" to stop the violence.

In 2010 the AJC-program also took us to meet with Palestinian officials in the West Bank. Our Jewish hosts wanted to make sure to show us as many sides as possible in this long and complicated conflict. 

Since the horrors of October 7 it has become less complicated. 

Hamas has made it brutally simple to pick a side - the opposite side of terror and antisemitism.

The challenge for us now will be to see it through. #neveragainisnow",,153,"{'like_count': 144, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 2910}",Tanit Koch,,2023-10-16 10:34:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/119322018_266243991054284_8923873948312608023_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=V25dDUP26ysAX84tQsC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCAXw3NcwtX6YOLK7-osESPq4TdIdOoKrdqZuvSEO5aEA&oe=655AC9E8,https://www.instagram.com/p/CydN7-zMTTD/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392750966_3361690190788164_3104167305111396245_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=l7tNzvP1tloAX-wVNJx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAmgWN4Ox7zD43s45UFAZxhSEJkM9LN4FrrB5pzoJz3Ig&oe=655A76D8

instagram,"A Chicago-area landlord was arrested and charged with murder and hate crimes after authorities said he stabbed and killed a 6-year-old boy and seriously wounded his mother, allegedly because the tenants are Muslim.

Joseph M. Czuba, 71, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of a hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the Will County, Illinois, Sheriff‚Äôs Office said in a news release. The US Justice Department has also opened a federal hate crime investigation into the attack, US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Sunday.

The sheriff‚Äôs office said Czuba did not make a statement to detectives but investigators determined the victims were ‚Äútargeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.‚Äù

The family is Palestinian and ‚Äúcame to America seeking what we all seek‚Äîa refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace,‚Äù according to the White House.

Authorities were called to the residence in unincorporated Plainfield Township, roughly 40 miles southwest of Chicago, shortly before noon Saturday after a woman called 911 saying her landlord had attacked her, according to the sheriff‚Äôs office.

When deputies arrived, they found Czuba sitting on the ground, near the home‚Äôs driveway, the release said. The two victims were found in a bedroom, each with ‚Äúmultiple stab wounds,‚Äù and were taken to the hospital, according to the release.

The boy was stabbed 26 times and succumbed to his injuries, the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

The 32-year-old woman, who had more than a dozen stab wounds, is recovering at the hospital and is expected to survive, the office said.

instagram,"WHITE HOUSE AFRAID ISRAEL ACTING WITHOUT A PLAN: The Biden administration is concerned that Israel has no plan for the occupation of Gaza and is pressing Israel to plan beyond the immediate goal of eradicating Hamas.
* President Biden said reoccupying Gaza would be ‚Äúa big mistake.‚Äù
* Biden aides have steered clear of public criticism of Israel‚Äôs Gaza strategy, and State Department officials have been told to avoid language calling for a ceasefire or de-escalation.
* Why It Matters: Israel has delayed the ground offensive into Gaza, originally planned for this past weekend, until later this week. If Israel is attempting to de-escalate, it may be too late to avoid a larger regional conflict. Netanyahu‚Äôs ‚Äúblinking‚Äù could accelerate his likely ouster from the Prime Ministership, pushing Netanyahu to continue with the offensive. ‚Äì R.C.

instagram,"Many statements have been made about the current situation unfolding in the Holy Land. As an organization who partners with local Community Leaders in both Israel and Palestine, we want to express our deep concern for the ongoing and unspeakable violence unfolding there.
.
From the start, we want to make it clear we strongly condemn the acts of terrorism and violence and the taking of lives and hostages committed by Hamas. We are deeply concerned for the welfare of all of the hostages and join the chorus of voices pleading for their immediate release and for the ceasing of all violent acts at the hands of Hamas.
.
We also want to say we cannot look away from or support the ongoing attacks and collective punishment currently being meted out by the IDF on the people of Gaza, many of whom are civilians (women, children, the elderly) trapped in a place they cannot escape. We cry out for an immediate ceasefire and for the restoration of water, electricity, and humanitarian supplies to Gaza.
.
We realize that our world is polarizing around this conflict. If you speak out in support of one side you will most likely be canceled by the other. This, sadly, is what maintains silence in the presence of injustice and allows oppression to continue unchecked. Silencing voices will never create a path towards a just peace and reconciliation in the Holy Land.
.
It is our hope in sharing our concerns to point you towards listening and learning and to encourage you to take a deeper look into the very complex and nuanced narratives surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. May this crisis in the Holy Land cultivate a sincere curiosity in you. Follow the thread of curiosity beyond the headlines to the human stories of Palestinian and Israeli families. Let them teach us about the centuries of tension, the world powers, and what injustice feels like in daily life. Peace will not be accomplished until the roots of this conflict are addressed with honesty.
.
Simply choosing a side without a fuller understanding of both sides of the larger story can sadly become the first step in dehumanizing one people group and elevating the value of another.

instagram,"Shared this in an email today and cross-posting here:
Last week I couldn‚Äôt stop scrolling. As a Jewish person living in America, I feel so much pain about what‚Äôs going on in the Middle East.
Much of what I‚Äôm coming across says:¬†
‚ÄúNow is not the time to stay silent.‚Äù¬†
‚ÄúUse your voice on behalf of the Israeli people.‚Äù¬†
‚ÄúUse your voice on behalf of the Palestinian people.‚Äù¬†
(Are you seeing this too?)
In many ways, I‚Äôm not qualified to weigh in about what is going on. I will admit that for much of my life I‚Äôve resisted educating myself on the nuances of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. I thought it was too complicated, I could never understand. I realize now that the ignorance I was choosing is a privilege, and if I want to live in a just world (I do) it‚Äôs imperative to seek this education. I will resurface¬†an episode of the Find Your Voice Speak Your Truth podcast that I recorded with my friend Tracy Alexander, a former news reporter in Israel who now teaches meditation, in my stories. And I will also say I am continuing to listen to and learn from many additional perspectives.¬†
What‚Äôs rising to the surface for me as I digest the news during this horrible time is:
People are not governments.¬†
People are not terrorist organizations.¬†
I grieve deeply for the people of Israel, and Jewish people all over the world.¬†
I grieve deeply for the people of Palestine, and Muslim people all over the world.¬†
I pray for the politicians who are making lethal decisions with a hardened heart.
I pray for the people acting as terrorists who are carrying fear and hate in their heart.¬†
I pray for an end to the fighting.¬†
I pray for unity, love, and compassion.
I‚Äôve heard so many times that my ancestors perished in the Holocaust because people did not speak up. And now here we are again, and we must speak. If I have anything I can contribute to this conversation, I will rely most on my expertise about the human voice. Here is what I believe:¬†
It is okay if you don‚Äôt speak up right away.
It is okay if you listen.¬†
It is okay if you pause.

Tomorrow Saturn will enter the 12th sign of the Zodiac...PISCES ‚ôìÔ∏è. This is a lot to cover so I have to do it in parts, but this is going to be a big shift. 

üåô 

Saturn has gone through the signs of it's rulership, CAPRICORN ‚ôëÔ∏è then AQUARIUS ‚ôíÔ∏è (making my life a fcking hell.. but lessons I have to learn to embrace) which are earth and air.  Now it is entering the watery sign of PISCES ‚ôìÔ∏è. 

üåô 

There is good to this and some not so good.  Saturn is about discipline and boundaries and PISCES ‚ôìÔ∏è doesn't really like boundaries.  And we have to remember that Saturn has an association with delays, karma, grief,  and just not getting our way. 

üåô 

Saturn also being in the 12th sign is going to uncover a lot of secrets especially with....politicians, government AND the church.  With PISCES ‚ôìÔ∏è being the sign of spirituality,  there will be some spiritual growth for many through much conflict.

instagram,"Finance Minister Choo Kyung-ho said Monday that Korea will extend the tax cut on fuel consumption through December amid concerns about growing inflationary pressure caused by the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The government has applied a 25 percent discount on the consumption of gasoline and a 37 percent discount on the consumption of diesel, which was set to expire at the end of October.

""Oil prices are feared to jump, which will cause greater volatility in the real economy and financial and foreign currency markets, depending on the developments of the incident,"" Choo said during an emergency economic ministers' meeting.

""We will make all-out efforts to stabilize prices and the public's livelihoods by thoroughly managing energy and food prices,"" he said. ""The government will temporarily extend oil subsidies through the end of this year and beef up on-site inspections into any price hikes riding on the volatility.""

instagram,"#Manipur | Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday charged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was more concerned about happenings in Israel than in Manipur, which has been riven by an ethnic conflict since May this year.
 
Addressing a rally near Raj Bhavan here after undertaking a 2-km-long padayatra through the city roads, he said that neighbouring Manipur is no longer a unified single state, but has been divided into two states on ethnic lines.
 
Gandhi, who began a two-day visit to poll-bound Mizoram, asserted that the Congress had ushered in peace in the insurgency-hit northeastern state with the signing of a peace accord in 1986.
 
""It is amazing to me that the PM and the Government of India is so interested in what is happening in Israel (Israel-Hamas conflict) but not interested at all in what is happening in Manipur, where people have been murdered, women molested and babies killed,"" he said.
 
""The idea of India that respects each other, is tolerant, learns from other ideas, religions and languages and that loves itself as a whole... That is the idea of India which is under attack by the BJP.
 
""They (BJP) attack different communities, religions and languages. They spread hatred and violence in the country. They spread arrogance, lack of understanding and this is completely against the idea of India,"" he added.

instagram,"SOLIDARITY WITH PALESTINE - RALLY AT RIALTO ROUNDABOUT FRIDAY OCT 20 FROM 5:30 PM

As Israel continues its relentless bombardment of civilians in the Gaza strip, alongside increased repression in the West Bank, we must condemn their collective punishment of the Palestinian people.

Israel has cut off all supplies to Gaza, including medical supplies, electricity, food, water, and fuel. They ordered over 1 million people to flee the Northern end of Gaza, then bombed the designated evacuation routes. They have ordered the evacuation of hospitals, with the threat of bombing.

These are war crimes and must be condemned as such.

There are not two equal sides to this conflict. Israel is a viciously racist apartheid state, armed to the teeth by the Western powers. They carry out their brutality with the full backing of NATO, the US and EU.

Join the rally at Rialto roundabout this Friday evening to show solidarity with the people of Palestine and to call on the Irish Government to:

- Expel the Israeli ambassador
- Cut all diplomatic, trade and military ties with Israel
- Demand EU does the same
- Use official Government statements to criticize role of US and EU in enabling Israeli war crimes
- Do everything in its power to stop the impending genocide in Gaza",,110,"{'like_count': 108, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 3050}",BriÃÅd Smith,,2023-10-16 17:54:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/47693623_2615834865123571_7042055870607261696_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=HfamoEsOkZEAX_QQIny&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC6n2MqVZJ1bmHWLFWm5bh4AjGF6UdjSPgUjohA6H4miA&oe=655B44C5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyeARJ_NOZW/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391733782_881792666649944_6989304290447485267_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=kkyzfNLX6ksAX8GwZTn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBwSxm5e8uR6xUR5OeU_t20VgueXkRhp-CAOg3hpFMmOw&oe=654FDB1D
instagram,"Israel-Hamas: Saudi Arabia Summons Nigeria, Other Islamic Countries To Emergency Meeting
.
.
The ruler of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, King Salman bin Abdulaziz has summoned an emergency meeting of the member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
 
Naija News reports that the emergency meeting is called to discuss the ongoing conflict in the Gaza strip between Hamas and Israel.

In a statement posted on OIC‚Äôs official website on Sunday, the meeting is slated for October 18 and 19, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The statement reads: ‚ÄúAt the invitation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which chairs the current session of the Islamic Summit and the Executive Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Organization‚Äôs Executive Committee is convening an urgent open-ended extraordinary meeting at the ministerial level, to address the escalating military situation in Gaza and its environs as well as the deteriorating conditions that endanger the lives of civilians and the overall security and stability of the region.

‚ÄúThe extraordinary meeting of the Executive Committee of the OIC will take place on Wednesday, October 18, 2023, at the General Secretariat headquarters in Jeddah Governorate.‚Äù

The OIC is the second largest organisation after the United Nations with a membership of 57 states spread over four continents. The organisation is the collective voice of the Muslim world.

Nigeria has been a member of OIC since 1986.

Recall that Hamas on October 7th launched an unprecedented and coordinated land, air and sea incursion of Israel which reportedly k!lled 1,300 Israelis.

According to Gaza‚Äôs health ministry, at least 1,900 Palestinians have been k!lled by Israeli retaliatory str!kes, including 614 children and 370 women",,108,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 108, 'num_users': 195349}",News /Entertainment Blog,,2023-10-16 17:35:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/395170331_343928994837444_8252865226911664156_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=3IeRKd8XatkAX-3eeoD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAK8tedv_vAY4PuddoyZGvC-eeffeaRDHkDtkZZf3KiVQ&oe=655A869C,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyd-HTHMP-t/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393164802_6570437373024966_7129159633525798489_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ehThLJdNtkMAX_KQfK8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCDmhEjQkV3r7McBYXC-d0kGvKDgRooQuzE7zkxtu6Tag&oe=654E54A3

Baruch College plaza mostly with students. They made pray ceremony and peacefully protested around the plaza demanding Baruch consider a Palestinian side of the conflict and show support not just to Israel. 
2 arrests have been made with no resistance to police. Reasons stayed unknown.
After that protesters organize marched to Times Square with heavy police control and presence and join another group around 41st street and Broadway. Among Palestinian people I was able to see supporters from other nations mostly Arabic.
Protesters demanded justice, peace, to stop to kill innocent civilians and destroy Gaza.
After that they marched to Israel consulate and protested there. I did not notice any aggressive behavior except few African American people with were aggressive to police but they were not Palestinians.

instagram,"There is no good without evil. It takes one to recognize the other. It takes two to tango. One side must bare the weight of the other for the dance to continue. These opposites exist in tandem, together they add value and dimension to everything life has to offer. Just like two sides of the same coin, both go hand in hand shining the light and casting the shadow.
A concept of angels and devils as opposing spiritual forces is a widely spread motif in many cultures and religious traditions.
Angels are often seen as representing goodness, purity, and divine grace, while evil, sin, and corruption are associated with devils. This duality is often used to illustrate the struggle between good and evil that exists within the human soul, and the choice we must make for these two paths to become one.
The duality of angels and devils can be seen as a metaphor for the inner conflict that we experience as human beings, representing opposing forces within us pulling us in different directions.
In some religious traditions, the struggle between angels and devils is also seen as the journey of the soul towards redemption and salvation. The presence of both good and evil within us serves as a reminder of the importance of choosing to follow the path of righteousness, and of our capacity for growth and spiritual transformation.

instagram,"Republican lawmakers are moving to introduce legislation that would prohibit the
U.S. from accepting potential Palestinian refugees displaced by the conflict in Israel.
Reps. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., and Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., will introduce the Guaranteeing Aggressors Zero Admission Act, or the GAZA Act, which aims to prevent the Biden administration from granting visas to holders of Palestinian passports, according to a report from the New York Post Saturday.
""We can't let President Biden abuse our parole and visa rules to bring unvetted Palestinians into
American communities the way he did with thousands of unvetted Afghans,"" Tiffany said of the legislation in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.  The bill would also prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from allowing Palestinians into the country through its parole program.  According to the report, experts believe that there could be more than a million Palestinian refugees from Israel's bombardment of Gaza. ""I introduced the GAZA Act to protect America‚Äôs national security,"" Tiffany said.

The bill comes at the same time as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced his intention to introduce legislation aimed at forcing the Biden administration to cancel visas for foreign nationals who ""endorse or espouse terrorist activity."" ""America is the most generous nation on earth, but we cannot allow foreign nationals who support terrorist groups like Hamas and march in our streets calling for ‚Äòintifada‚Äô to enter or stay in our country,"" Rubio said in a press release.

instagram,"On Saturday night, Israeli planes struck Aleppo International Airport, rendering it non-operational. This came just two days after strikes on both Aleppo and Damascus International Airports. Meanwhile, Israeli bombings in Gaza have caused significant destruction, especially in its northern regions. As of Monday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported 2,750 casualties, including 730 children, with 9,700 injuries.

A recent Axios report indicated the UAE cautioned Assad against meddling in the Israel-Hamas conflict or allowing assaults from Syrian territory. In response to the ongoing violence, towns in Daraa Governorate, Harak and Muzayrib saw demonstrations on October 13, expressing solidarity with Gaza‚Äôs residents and with Idlib, which are currently experiencing severe military escalation.

Simultaneously, large-scale protests persist in As-Suwayda Governorate. Last Friday, a significant gathering at Karama Square voiced calls to overthrow the current regime and implement Resolution 2254, also showing support for Gaza and Idlib.

On October 10, the Court of Justice convened its inaugural session on Syria's alleged breach of the Convention against Torture, a case presented by Canada and the Netherlands. With Syrian representatives absent, the prosecution urged immediate action against torture and access to detention centers for monitoring.

Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, Yemen‚Äôs Foreign Minister, revealed Damascus‚Äô decision to transfer the Yemeni embassy in Syria to his internationally recognized government, after requesting that Houthi representatives vacate the premises.

Lastly, the Syrian Democratic Forces lamented the loss of 30 anti-drug Asayish members after a Turkish airstrike on October 8.

instagram,"US President Joe Biden condemned the killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy as a ‚Äúhorrific act of hate‚Äù on Sunday, after authorities charged the assailant with murder and hate crimes for an attack allegedly linked to the war between Israel and Hamas.

The child was stabbed 26 times by his landlord on Saturday and later died at hospital, while his 32-year-old mother was also wounded but expected to survive, the Will County sheriff‚Äôs office in Illinois said in a statement.

‚ÄúDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs office said, adding the killing took place about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Chicago.

Biden, in a statement late Sunday, confirmed that the woman was the boy‚Äôs mother and said their ‚ÄúPalestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek ‚Äî a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values,‚Äù added Biden, calling for Americans to ‚Äúcome together and reject Islamaphobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred.‚Äù

Authorities said the woman managed to call 911 as she fought off the landlord, named by the sheriff‚Äôs office as 71-year-old Joseph Czuba.

‚ÄúDeputies located two victims inside the residence in a bedroom. Both victims had multiple stab wounds to their chest, torso, and upper extremities,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs statement said.

A serrated military-style knife with a seven-inch blade was pulled from the boy‚Äôs abdomen during the autopsy, the statement said.

When police arrived they found Czuba sitting on the ground near the driveway of the residence with a laceration on his forehead. He was taken to hospital for treatment before being charged with murder, attempted murder, and two counts of hate crimes.

‚ÄúHe knocked on the door and attempted to choke her, and said, ‚Äòyou Muslims‚Äô must die,‚Äù Ahmed Rehab, head of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Chicago office, told reporters, citing text messages sent by the woman to the murdered boy‚Äôs father from her hospital bed.",,97,"{'like_count': 95, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 73212}",TV 47,,2023-10-16 07:31:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/397505874_851265500116880_4990367675420195012_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KewZmtaGjWUAX9ofx9I&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCpZxwGP42aUNvrlhXZykm6r869U3jd9QXtzNnG-_Axnw&oe=6559CCB4,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyc46GwN6FB/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391264948_1490495161746832_7001388331557975449_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=61NU0oKZMTYAX_8SWLv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCdwoWwTjZC3vQd_WKrZf8kPmFCfSCw-MU_AyKtUeu2HA&oe=6531C1F3

instagram,"Israel vowed to ""demolish Hamas"" as its troops massed on the border with Gaza, as an Egyptian-controlled crossing into the enclave is expected to reopen amid diplomatic efforts to get aid to the millions of Palestinians besieged there after Hamas' deadly rampage through Israeli border towns.
Top U.S. officials warned that the war between Israel and militant group Hamas could escalate, as American warships headed to the area amid growing clashes on Israel's northern border with Lebanon.

Thousands of Palestinians have evacuated Gaza City for southern areas of the enclave, after Israel warnings. Hamas has asked them to stay put.
CONFLICT
Iran warned Israel of escalation if it failed to end aggressions against Palestinians. Its foreign minister said other parties in the region were ready to act, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported.
Palestinians are desperate to find a safe hiding place, but Hamas has warned people not to leave their homes, saying dozens of people were killed in strikes on cars and trucks carrying refugees, which Reuters could not independently verify. Israel says Hamas is preventing people from leaving in order to use them as human shields, which Hamas denies.
The expected Israeli ground offensive and air strikes have raised fears of unprecedented suffering in the narrow, impoverished Gaza Strip, one of the world's most crowded places. The fate of 4-year-old Fulla Al-Laham is just one of many heartbreaking examples: her grandmother said an air strike hit the family home, killing Fulla's parents, siblings and members of her extended family.
Gaza health officials are storing the bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli air strikes in ice-cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals is too risky and cemeteries lack space. Hospitals are also rapidly running out of fuel to power generators, putting the lives of patients at risk.
