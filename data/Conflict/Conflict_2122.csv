facebook,"""Les Misérables"" is a sprawling novel written by Victor Hugo and first published in 1862. It tells the story of several characters, primarily focusing on Jean Valjean, a former convict who seeks redemption, and Inspector Javert, who relentlessly pursues him. Here's a summary and critical analysis: Summary: - The novel begins with the release of Jean Valjean, who has served 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread. He struggles to find work and is shown kindness by a bishop who helps him turn his life around. - Valjean adopts a new identity and becomes a successful businessman, but he is relentlessly pursued by Inspector Javert, who is obsessed with capturing him. - The story is set against the backdrop of the June Rebellion in Paris, with characters like Fantine, Cosette, Marius, and Eponine playing significant roles. - Fantine is a destitute woman who leaves her daughter, Cosette, in the care of the unscrupulous Thénardiers. Valjean takes Cosette in and raises her as his own. - Marius, a student, falls in love with Cosette, while Eponine secretly loves Marius. The story weaves together the lives of these characters, culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion. Critical Analysis: - ""Les Misérables"" is a powerful social commentary on themes like justice, redemption, love, and the impact of society on individuals. It portrays the harsh conditions of the poor in 19th-century France and critiques the justice system. - The character of Jean Valjean represents the possibility of personal transformation and redemption. His struggles and moral dilemmas make him a deeply sympathetic character. - Inspector Javert, while the antagonist, is a complex character. His unwavering dedication to the law and his internal conflict between duty and mercy provide depth to the narrative. - The novel explores various forms of love, including romantic love (Marius and Cosette), maternal love (Fantine's love for Cosette), and unrequited love (Eponine's love for Marius), highlighting the profound impact of love on the characters' lives. - Hugo uses vivid descriptions of settings and backgrounds, which contribute to the novel's rich atmosphere. - The June Rebellion serves as a backdrop for the characters' fates and symbolizes the larger struggles for justice and societal change. ""Les Misérables"" is a classic of world literature, known for its moral depth, memorable characters, and the enduring theme of the human capacity for change and compassion. It has been adapted into numerous films, stage productions, and other media, making its themes and characters a part of global culture.",,20277,"{'like_count': 9262, 'comment_count': 452, 'num_users': 100284}",English literature,,2023-10-21 02:27:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/299528495_445026350972793_8155050084057353263_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=FZZjUKsCdGkAX-fn84k&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDzC_yVQ2jKafXX78aNohn8jkCdKuosROGtB2DFc7a9hg&oe=655ACA0C,https://www.facebook.com/100063962958074/posts/736182078523884,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394072350_736182045190554_102752920451308832_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4kScOKhHILcAX-pksBp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAslOCGi0_UmC2uGGPmUO47vC5LiolK9iDLWLuchQVBPQ&oe=65379F12

facebook,"Press Release issued by the Presidency of the Arab Republic of Egypt The Cairo Peace Summit Saturday October 21, 2023 __________________________________________________________ At the invitation of the Arab Republic of Egypt, leaders, heads of government, and envoys of a number of regional and international countries met in Cairo on Saturday, October 21, 2023, to consult and explore ways to advance efforts toward containing the aggravating crisis in the Gaza Strip and toward military de-escalation between the Israeli and Palestinian sides. Escalation has claimed thousands of innocent civilian lives since the outbreak of armed confrontations on October 7. By calling for this summit, the Arab Republic of Egypt sought to build international consensus that transcends cultures, races, religions, and political stances, the core of which is the values of humanity and its collective conscience that rejects violence, terrorism, and unlawful killing of souls, that calls for an end to the ongoing war that has claimed the lives of thousands of innocent civilians on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides, that demands upholding the rules of international law and international humanitarian law, that underscores the ultimate importance of protecting civilians and of not exposing them to dangers and threats and that gives special priority to providing access, ensuring the flow of humanitarian and relief aid, and delivering it to the right beneficiaries from the people of the Gaza Strip. This consensus also warns of the dangers of the current conflict spreading to other areas of the region. Egypt looked forward for the participants to launch a global call for peace, in which they agree on the importance of re-assessing the international strategy for addressing the Palestinian issue over the past decades so as to emerge from the current crisis with a new political spirit and will that pave the way for unlocking a real and serious peace process. This shall lead, in a short period of time, to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, along the June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The international scene over the past decades has revealed a serious deficiency in finding a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue, because it sought to manage the conflict, and not end it permanently. It confined itself to offering temporary solutions and analgesics that do not live up to the minimum aspirations of a people who have suffered for more than 80 years of foreign occupation and attempts to obliterate identity and loss of hope. The ongoing war has also disclosed a shortcoming in the values of the international community in addressing crises. While we see one place rushing and competing to promptly condemn the killing of innocent people, we find incomprehensible hesitation in denouncing the same act in another place. We even see attempts to justify this killing, as if the life of the Palestinian human being is less important than that of other people. The lives lost every day during the current crisis and the women and children trembling in terror under the air strikes around the clock compel the international community's response to be commensurate with the gravity of the event. The right of the Palestinian person is not excluded from others whom the rules of international humanitarian law include or from international conventions that address human rights. The Palestinian people must enjoy all the rights enjoyed by other peoples, starting with the utmost right, which is the right to life, and their right to find safe housing, decent health care, and education for their children and above all they must have a state that embodies their identity and to which they are proud to belong. The Arab Republic of Egypt, which took the initiative to call for the Peace Summit, expresses its deep appreciation to the countries and organizations that responded to the invitation despite time constraints. On this occasion, it confirms that it will spare no effort in continuing to work with all partners in order to achieve the goals that called for holding this summit, regardless of the difficulties or the duration of the conflict. Egypt will always maintain its firm position in support of Palestinian rights, believing in peace as a strategic and irreversible option until the vision of a two-state solution, Palestinian and Israeli, living side by side is realized. Within the framework of Egypt’s efforts to achieve these noble goals, it will never accept calls to liquidate the Palestinian cause at the expense of any country in the region. It will not relent for a moment in safeguarding its sovereignty and national security under increasingly dangerous and threatening circumstances and situations, relying on the help of Allah Almighty and the will and determination of its people.",,3558,"{'like_count': 1586, 'comment_count': 825, 'num_users': 2379927}",المتحدث الرسمي لرئاسة الجمهورية-Spokesman for the Egyptian Presidency,,2023-10-21 14:21:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/328441906_909358313530689_6753333129130148843_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eHjJH8VKXdcAX8FFJ6b&_nc_oc=AQkz-ovPXPjNN9FGHjcE2gTOdWr2EhnAkTFzoZEb-dmM1r1g7Q6z08gVYdu6pv5O7YY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfChrQ0doEGmYFJpwy4OpzBVrRwPE-ylfgG3fOXqiAQVew&oe=6559EF70,https://www.facebook.com/100044362122571/posts/891266169028779,

facebook,"Speech by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi President of the Arab Republic of Egypt At the Cairo Peace Summit “In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful” Your Majesties, Highnesses and Excellences The Kings, Princes, Heads of State and Government Honorable Attendees We are meeting in Cairo today at a challenging time that tests our humanity before our interests and the depth of our faith in the value of the human being and in his right to life. The principles we profess to support are also called into question and scrutinized in these difficult times. I tell you honestly, that all the peoples of the world, not only the peoples of this region, are following with eyes wide open our stances at this momentous and historical moment, in the wake of the military escalation which began on the seventh of October in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Egypt condemns, in the clearest terms, the targeting, killing and intimidation of all peaceful civilians. At the same time, Egypt is expressing its deep shock that the world is standing by idly, while the catastrophic humanitarian crisis unfolds. Two and a half million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are being subjected to collective punishment. They are living under siege and facing starvation and ferocious pressure of forced displacement, through practices condemned by the civilized world that has concluded agreements and established the international law and humanitarian international law to criminalize and prohibit their recurrence. This compels us to restate our call to provide international protection for the Palestinian people and the innocent civilians. And let me ask frankly: Where are the values of human civilization that we have established over long millennia and decades? Where is equality of human souls without discrimination or segregation or double standards? From the very first moment, Egypt has engaged in unyielding, strenuous and vigorous efforts, day and night, to coordinate and deliver humanitarian aid and relief to the besieged Palestinians in Gaza. Egypt has not closed the Rafah land crossing at any moment. However, the repeated Israeli shelling of the Palestinian side obstructed its operation. Amidst the severity of the circumstances on the ground, I agreed with the American President to operate the crossing on a sustainable basis, under the supervision of and coordination with the United Nations, the UNRWA and the Palestinian Red Crescent. The aid and relief shall be distributed under the supervision of the United Nations to the people in the Gaza Strip. Ladies and Gentlemen, The world must never condone the use of human suffering to force people into displacement. Egypt has affirmed, and is reiterating, its vehement rejection of the forced displacement of the Palestinians and their transfer to Egyptian lands in Sinai, as this will mark the last gasp in the liquidation of the Palestinian cause, shatter the dream of an independent Palestinian state, and squander the struggle of the Palestinian people and that of the Arab and Islamic peoples over the course of the Palestinian cause that has endured for 75 years. He will be mistaken in his understanding of the nature of the Palestinian people, whoever thinks that these proud, steadfast and resilient people are willing to abandon their land, even if that land is under occupation or bombardment. I want to state it clearly and unequivocally to the world, and articulate in sincere terms the will of all the Egyptian people, every single Egyptian: that the liquidation of the Palestinian cause without a just solution is beyond the realm of possibility, and in all cases it will never happen at the expense of Egypt, absolutely not. Honorable Attendees, Is this region destined to endure this conflict for eternity? Isn’t it about time to address the root causes of the problem of the Middle East. Hasn’t the time come yet to dispel the political illusions that the status quo can sustain, meaning the state of unilateral measures, settlements, the desecration of holy sites, and uprooting of the Palestinians from their homes and villages and from Al Quds Al Sharif (The Holy City of Jerusalem). Egypt has paid a heavy price for peace to prevail in this region .. it initiated it when the voice of war predominated .. and maintained it alone .. when the voice of hollow exaggerations was prevalent. Egypt stood tall, leading its region toward peaceful co-existence based on justice. Today, Egypt is telling you in all candor and sincerity: that the solution for the Palestinian cause is not displacement, and is not by forcibly transferring the entire people to other regions; the one and only solution is justice, with the Palestinians obtaining their legitimate rights for self-determination, and leading a proud and safe life in an independent state on their land like the rest of the peoples of the earth Ladies and Gentlemen, We are encountering an unprecedented crisis, that necessitates utmost (truncated)",,3001,"{'like_count': 1406, 'comment_count': 329, 'num_users': 2379927}",المتحدث الرسمي لرئاسة الجمهورية-Spokesman for the Egyptian Presidency,,2023-10-21 09:49:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/328441906_909358313530689_6753333129130148843_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eHjJH8VKXdcAX8FFJ6b&_nc_oc=AQkz-ovPXPjNN9FGHjcE2gTOdWr2EhnAkTFzoZEb-dmM1r1g7Q6z08gVYdu6pv5O7YY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfChrQ0doEGmYFJpwy4OpzBVrRwPE-ylfgG3fOXqiAQVew&oe=6559EF70,https://www.facebook.com/100044362122571/posts/891158535706209,

facebook,"AuDHD can be tricky to identify. Here are some of my traits: 🌻 Stimming a lot but a lot of my stims are subtle (outlining pictures and words in my palm) or socially acceptable (playing with hair, humming). These days I rock, fidget, do throat things, rhythmic tapping, humming. I don't sit still. 🌻 Sensory sensitivity, especially temperature (heat), food smells, noise (hearing any sort of ad on TV or radio makes me deeply annoyed), pressure (being on a car, plane, underwater), texture (dirt, sticky stuff, slimy stuff). 🌻 Scripting- rehearsing the conversation in my head before I have it, especially if I'm stressed about it. 🌻 RSD- compulsive people pleasing, major anxiety about conflict, unable to disagree or cope with arguments. Can't draw boundaries. Can't speak up for myself. 🌻 Driven by rules. I follow rules to a fault, and I remember being so unbelievably furious when others around me didn't follow the rules. How very dare they. 🌻 Interoception. I don't receive loud messages from my body that I'm hungry, thirsty, tired, or need the bathroom. So I forget to do all those things. 🌻 Eating- I hate food a lot of the time. Everything is like eating cardboard and nothing is acceptable. 🌻 Preference for sames- same books, same shows, same play list, same routine, same clothes, same products. I can do new things but I usually prefer not to. 🌻 High masking. I used to copy the people I was with- their interests, mannerisms, trends, emotions. These days I don't. 🌻 I don't click with most people. There's a disconnect. I also do click so amazingly well with a handful of people who just get me, and it's effortless. 🌻 I don't do small talk. I can do it, but it's not fun, it's awkward and I prefer not to. 🌻 I can do eye contact but it's often awkward. I overthink it and end up not hearing what it actually being said to me. 🌻 I have to consciously think about what my face is doing during conversations. It often moves too much and I can't really control that. It means my expressions can be cartoony and not seem natural. 🌻 Low spatial awareness. I always run into door frames, tables, people, and I am really bad at parking. 🌻 Deep interests that stick around for years and occupy all my thoughts. 🌻 Preference for 'young' stuff. I tend to go for movies, books and interests aimed at younger people. Adult stuff is too confronting, too uncomfortable, and too traumatic. 🌻 I'm good with tone and great with words. I speak quickly and people often think I sound proper or have an accent. 🌻 I don't experience empathy as a feeling but as a logical thought process. 🌻 I really love tiny tiny things. 🌻 I have fluctuating capacity to do stuff. Some days I get a lot done and other days I'm so outrageously exhausted and emotional and nothing happens. 🌻 So overwhelmed by typical adult stuff- work, cleaning, laundry, food preparation, showering, parenting, jobs. 🌻 Hyperlexic. Great at spelling. Horrible at maths. Couldn't tell tell time until I was 13. 🌻 Impulsive. I get a huge rush of inspiration and need to immediately do whatever the thing is. 🌻 I get extremely distressed when I expect something of myself and it doesn't turn out. I'm not usually upset unless the fault is mine. 🌻 Creative, artistic, dramatic. I like accents. Once I pretended to have one for several days when we were on a family holiday. ....... There are definitely more. I thought it might be helpful to see how Autism + ADHD can look in a high-masking human. I know many of you are wondering about your own brains. Do you relate to any of these?

facebook,"The world came face-to-face with evil incarnate this month. Terrorist killers carried out the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the end of the Holocaust. Devastation after devastation. And then on top of that, we see the emergence of another deadly counter. Rather than waiting for the facts, members of Congress and mainstream-media outlets carried the narrative of an evil, lying terrorist organization: Hamas. The misinformation war could be just as if not more deadly than the ongoing conflict that has ravaged the Israeli people. Immediately following the surprise attacks within Israel’s borders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a signal that the Israel Defense Forces are going into Gaza, giving civilians a chance to find themselves out of harm’s way. This act of humanity was not afforded to the innocent Israeli civilians Hamas murdered. In another front, Hamas launched a misinformation campaign built on a lie that an Israeli missile struck a hospital, killing hundreds. That misinformation was carried in news outlets in America and across the globe. Hamas’ lie, spread by the media, caused a summit in Jordan to be canceled. It sparked protests at American embassies around the world. Hezbollah mobilized. We saw a very clear attempt to weaken Israel and its standing in the world. All built on a lie. The truth is Hamas-aligned Islamic Jihad fired the rocket, and dozens of innocent civilians in Gaza lost their lives. Then the Democratic members of the so-called “Squad,” such as Rep. Rashida Tlaib, parroted Hamas propaganda in social-media posts. Rather than delete her post, Tlaib kept it up. Worse, Tlaib continued to echo the lie during a pro-Hamas rally outside the Capitol. The Squad’s poisonous anti-Israel obsession did not begin these past few days. Rep. Pramila Jayapal practically copy-pasted Hamas propaganda this year and called Israel “a racist state.” In 2019, Rep. Ilhan Omar barely escaped House censure after invoking anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money. Their colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said that supporting Israel means “taking the side of occupation,” language that could have been cribbed from a terrorist press release. And on and on. I know we shouldn’t expect more from the Squad, but we cannot have members of Congress being a part of the propaganda machine for Hamas. It’s undeniably crazy. We deserve better. That’s why I’m leading the effort in the Senate to stop sending money into Gaza until Israel wipes Hamas off the face of the Earth. We cannot send money to Iran or Hamas. Period. When you give $6 billion to a country that funds terrorism, you cannot be surprised when they go and do what they always have done. Iran is the lead sponsor of terrorism and Hamas’ chief financial backer, yet the Biden administration has no interest in holding it accountable. This is not complicated. It is black and white. These murderers have killed and kidnapped hundreds of Israelis and slaughtered American citizens. There should not be a single US taxpayer dollar that risks ending up in the hands of Hamas, and any member of Congress who gives the group aid, comfort or justification is in violation of their constitutional oath and must be removed.",,1910,"{'like_count': 941, 'comment_count': 416, 'num_users': 684933}",Tim Scott,,2023-10-21 13:11:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/340988410_1223688611849328_2225153083397741310_n.jpg?stp=c685.106.1256.1256a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3l6A9uklBYkAX-DeZJA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDt57uPSsocsvB9QxvI2gzi42_18I9AQQc0iF5lUamfLA&oe=655A46BD,https://www.facebook.com/100044534345164/posts/870698931091244,

facebook,"President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. brings home the good news after his successful participation to the recently concluded inaugural Association of Southeast Asian Nations- Gulf Cooperation Council (ASEAN- GCC) Summit held in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In his arrival statement at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on 21 October 2023, the Chief Executive summarizes the results of his participation, where he promoted the Philippines as a dynamic environment for business prospects and established a deeper relationship with the Arab country. President Marcos Jr. engaged in bilateral talks with counterparts from Southeast Asia and the Gulf Nations, which include Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to further improve ties between the two regional blocs. Together with the Philippine delegation, the President reaffirmed the Administration's commitment to advance the country's priorities in the region within the ASEAN-GCC framework, highlighting the need for cooperation in sectors such as food and energy security, logistics and supply chains, digital transformation, and free flow of goods, with a focus on the rights and protection of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). He also urged fellow leaders from the ASEAN-GCC to uphold rules-based international order to ensure harmony for the rest of the world, following the recent turmoil in some areas, including the Israel and Gaza conflict. Capping off his trip, the President spent time with thousands of Filipinos in a gathering in Riyadh, where he reported the productive outcomes of his visit to the Kingdom and personally conveyed his gratitude for their invaluable contributions to the country.",,1790,"{'like_count': 394, 'comment_count': 478, 'num_users': 497545}",Radio Television Malacañang - RTVM,,2023-10-21 06:57:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242752604_232099998957363_5867204315811603150_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=H-sJzshk9aEAX9oeqHg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD9N0UXvpstwApCCx2JuKCG5sbf7DennaJLSiFG3yzXpQ&oe=655A41C8,https://www.facebook.com/100064720927568/posts/686393560090957,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/394278205_1090440611942467_6984244181845001679_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=o7USYpmEoi0AX9LLO4b&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBzZtNK2zpe-jHIh3pkVvN6nSe42LcNTgeG5XeEBhpKBw&oe=6537BD21

facebook,"🔥THE KING STALKER 🔥 ( HER DEEPEST OBSESSION ) BY NOEL INNOCENT CHAPTER SIXTY FOUR:STRANGE ISLAND 5 As I contemplated the dire situation outside, Jing began to voice her ideas about resolving the conflict, and I couldn't help but smile at her earnestness. Her suggestions seemed somewhat idealistic in the face of such imminent danger. ""Jing,"" I said, my tone gentle, ""I appreciate your optimism, but talking to them may not be as effective as you hope. There's a lot of fear and anger directed at us."" She paused for a moment, her determination unwavering, and then nodded, acknowledging the complexities of the situation. Her determination was indeed one of the qualities I admired most about her. ""However,"" I added, a hint of warmth in my voice, ""we should consider addressing another pressing matter first."" Her gaze turned to me, questioning, and her cheeks took on a rosy tone as she realized what I was referring to. ""Why don't you put on some clothes first,"" I suggested with a playful smile. Her face flushed as she hurried to get dressed, leaving me to wonder what challenges lay ahead and how we could navigate them together. As Jing quickly got dressed, I moved to the window to assess the situation outside. The villagers had gathered closer to the hotel, their angry shouts growing louder, and their weapons glinting in the sunlight. It was evident that they had one goal in mind: to get to us. We needed a plan. I turned to Jing, who had finished dressing. Her eyes were filled with a mixture of determination and fear. ""Jing,"" I began, ""We can't let them inside the hotel. I need you to find a way to barricade the doors. I'll go to the back exit and try to create a distraction to draw their attention away from you."" She nodded in agreement, her resolve shining through. ""And after that?"" ""After that,"" I replied, ""we'll need to find a safe place to hide, at least until help arrives."" We both knew that our options were limited, and the danger surrounding us was real. Yet, as we prepared to face this dire situation, there was a shared understanding that we would do whatever it took to protect one another. I stepped outside to confront the villagers, trying to maintain my composure despite the unsettling situation. The atmosphere was heavy with tension, and the villagers appeared unnaturally calm, as if they were under some dark influence that had robbed them of their humanity. Chen was at the forefront of the agitated mob. His grin sent angry down my spine, and his eyes seemed empty, devoid of any normal human emotion. I was perplexed and alarmed by their strange behavior. I addressed them with a mix of frustration and disbelief, ""Are you all sure you want to die today?"" I had no desire for violence, but their intentions were far from clear. ""You did this?"" I pointed accusingly at Chen, who maintained his eerie grin. Chen's grin widened, revealing a disconcerting hint of cruelty as he responded, ""You're not human either."" My frustration deepened as I tried to comprehend what was happening. These villagers were not themselves, and their bizarre actions were deeply disturbing. I didn't know the cause of their sudden change, but I was acutely aware of the danger I was in. I had to find a way to defuse the situation without resorting to violence, for the sake of Jing. I glanced back at the balcony where Jing stood, worry etching lines into her face. The villagers, once peaceful and welcoming, now seemed like a twisted version of themselves, under some dark influence that made them behave erratically. I turned back to the villagers and asked in a more measured tone, ""Why are you doing this? What's going on?"" Maybe I should try things Jing way and if it does work, I will definitely finish them off. Chen's eyes bore into me with an eerie intensity, and he responded in a cold, emotionless voice, ""You've brought a curse upon us, and it's time to end it.""he definitely is playing things into the villagers head. "" You must get rid of the curse you brought"" the villagers growl "" killing you is the only way "" I struggled to make sense of their accusations. What had they seen or heard to make them believe I was the source of their troubles? The air grew thick with tension as I weighed my options. I had no intention of hurting these villagers, but I couldn't let them harm me or Jing either. ""Listen to me,"" I implored, taking a step forward. ""I don't know what you're talking about. We're not here to cause any harm. just tell me what's going on. We can work this out."" The villagers remained undeterred, and their determination to rid themselves of the perceived curse remained unwavering. My words fell on deaf ears, and they closed in around me. Jing, watching from the balcony, realized that words alone would not resolve this crisis. Her voice trembled as she shouted, ""Muchen, be careful!"" As the villagers pressed closer, their once-familiar faces twisted with fear and hatred, I knew that peaceful negotiation was no longer an (truncated)",,1648,"{'like_count': 1338, 'comment_count': 48, 'num_users': 56935}",Noel paranormal series,,2023-10-21 17:37:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/400157919_824284529706692_6451631865401079606_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NdEuF1fu9uIAX9o03mW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCOR_yKwODV8-G_HmbDAzoTt8mR0MnDYFKjyvGIbu8ieQ&oe=655A5178,https://www.facebook.com/100063754568313/posts/812871044181374,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394279250_812871077514704_6099652545797058150_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QjxgGbkVLaUAX86tJa1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCyMxHARjYV3Acj_hWNShye0_vUzO6DfuGgbAQf4i_B0g&oe=6538AC73

Tell us about it, go ahead and thank them. Dr Larry Izamoje gives us a ""Sportainment"" edition of the programme to appreciate sportsmen/women/people who help others in their time of need. It has been revealed that of all athletes, Cristiano Ronaldo is the biggest giver. Years ago in Spain 10 month old Eric Ortiz Cruz had a health condition called cortical dysplasia, a life threatening condition that causes him to have up to 30 seizures a day. His parents could not pay over $83,000 plus in hospital bills. Somehow Ronaldo's friend heard about it and asked Ronaldo to donate a pair of boots and jersey, Ronaldo asked what for and he told him the full story about the baby. Ronaldo brought out his chequebook and wrote them a cheque of £60,000 equivalent to $84,000. He also wrote for flight ticket for Dad, mum and Eric to go to a cancer center in Barcelona. The boy is now 9 year old. Thomas another boy now 7 years old was in 2021 diagnosed with Neuroblastoma. His parents cried out snd when Ronaldo heard, he gave them a blank check and asked them to take him to a hospital. In two hospitals in Lisbon and Porto the name Ronaldo is always called because he donated over $1million worth of equipments in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) to help the sick during COVID. In 2016 he recorded a message to the children affected by the Syrian conflict stating ""I am with you"" He also made a silent donation. He also sold his European golden boot award and sent the proceeds to several schools in Gaza to help out school kids. Ronaldo is a blood donor he also donated bone marrow and encourages others to do the same. After winning the La Decima he bought every member of the team a Bvlgari watch. Ronaldo even stepped in to help his older brother drop a bad habit. Ronaldo grew up poor but he had 3 women who gave him burgers whenever he went to play football as a young boy. One of the women showed up and he took her to Turin to enjoy a meal. Literature says ""No one gives like Ronaldo (CR7)""",,1631,"{'like_count': 1038, 'comment_count': 306, 'num_users': 1230109}",Sports Radio Brila FM,,2023-10-21 06:40:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271658647_4876380232430490_1076005882224068007_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Uc_YjAa2EQYAX-PXGhM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBfgPtFI9h4uhTieMXSvRrEVzcH-q0QXZwot4nQcc_PIQ&oe=655B7B77,https://www.facebook.com/100064544808167/posts/714854370676050,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394520221_714834537344700_1657982848575589786_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GgQJiHVt-ecAX-ymWAg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDkdETBBwzIb8EDK7vDZU5x2r5nzkFkaZqxYgF42vg55g&oe=653A989C

facebook,"How to Strengthen Your Relationship...✍🏾 Everyone’s relationship is unique, and people come together for many different reasons. But there are some things that good relationships have in common. Knowing the basic principles of healthy relationships helps keep them meaningful, fulfilling and exciting in both happy times and sad: So what makes a healthy love relationship? 1. Staying involved with each other... Some relationships get stuck in peaceful coexistence, but without truly relating to each other and working together. While it may seem stable on the surface, lack of involvement and communication increases distance. When you need to talk about something important, the connection and understanding may no longer be there. 2. Getting through conflict... Some couples talk things out quietly, while others may raise their voices and passionately disagree. The key in a strong relationship, though, is not to be fearful of conflict. You need to be safe to express things that bother you without fear of retaliation, and be able to resolve conflict without humiliation, degradation or insisting on being right. 3. Keeping outside relationships and interests alive... No one person can meet all of our needs, and expecting too much from someone can put a lot of unhealthy pressure on a relationship. Having friends and outside interests not only strengthens your social network, but brings new insights and stimulation to the relationship, too. 4. Communicating... Honest, direct communication is a key part of any relationship. When both people feel comfortable expressing their needs, fears, and desires, trust and bonds are strengthened. Nonverbal cues—body language like eye contact, leaning forward or away, or touching someone’s arm—are critical to communication.",,1270,"{'like_count': 841, 'comment_count': 80, 'num_users': 507915}",Thoughts of Jacktone,,2023-10-21 05:17:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338001205_1368720427298146_7411246640499111275_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y2RUnb3oDQYAX-HSA0u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBqyqTelr8rLeEt81yumQygWi0FvjjsEBUdmYP8UoZ7VA&oe=655B2E12,https://www.facebook.com/100064148888578/posts/726085789539711,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394544294_726085759539714_9083600482657912878_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8XvAiRbY3oQAX8S-VRY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDIoj0dTlSD1HUmIivJ5oVoB6Vf7Xz67bgDvqdvvJOx2Q&oe=6538F911

facebook,"SEMNIFICAȚIA EMOȚIONALĂ A DEPENDENȚELOR. ""Dependențele sunt legate de nucleul familiei, supraprotejarea maternă și absența tatălui. Ambele cazuri din lipsa iubirii necondiționate. Toată dependența caută să evite contactul cu emoția. Poate fi un sentiment de goliciune existențială, lipsă de dragoste, senzație de singurătate, deconectare cu sinele nostru superior. Realitatea noastră ne face să suferim și dependența ne maschează suferința, temporar și apoi o înrăutățește. Dacă analizăm etimologic, cuvântul ADDICȚIE înseamnă „nespus”. Ceea ce nu pot sau nu vreau să exprim. . . Cocaina: ajută la gestionarea urii față de tată, la exprimarea a ceea ce nu îndrăznesc să exprim, deoarece cocaina mă dezinhibă. Iluzia unei mari treziri care facilitează relația cu ceilalți. Vreau să-mi recapăt puritatea sau ceea ce nu mai pot genera, precum admirația altora. . . Marijuana: ajută la gestionarea unei separări cu un cuplu și a identității sau poziției mele în fața acestei separări. Persoana care se caută pe sine, care nu știe ce a venit să facă pe planetă. Conflict de identitate Cine sunt eu? Cine este tatăl meu? . . Alcoolismul: Este legat de dorința de a fugi de responsabilitățile fizice sau emoționale de teama de a fi rănit și de a suferi din nou. . . Tutun: Tutunul este legat de conflictele mamei, trăind o situație profundă de singurătate. Lipsa comunicării cu mama sau excesul de protecție excesivă. Lipsa libertății și independenței. . . Obezitate: Încercarea de a-ți satisface foamea de dragoste cu mâncare. Cu cât mănânci mai mult, cu atât e mai mare foamea. Mănâncă pentru a încerca să depășești trecutul sau experiențele neasimilate. . . Ciocolată: nevoia de dragoste și dulceață a tatălui. Conflictele cu absența, lipsa iubirii sau devalorizarea tatălui. . . Zahăr: Nevoia de a îndulci viața, compensând sentimentul de lipsă de dragoste, tandrețe și bucurie în persoană. . . Dependența sexuală: încercarea de a umple spiritualul cu fizicul, gândind că a face sex înseamnă a avea dragoste. . . ‍Dependența de a lucra: a trăi cu prea mult atașament și teamă, pentru a nu suferi de lipsă. Credeți că trebuie arătat că viața mea este productivă și că alții recunosc că merit ceva. . . Dependență de exerciții fizice: dificultăți în acceptarea ta. Dependența de starea ta fizică (în afară) pentru a umple și umple golul (înăuntru) al nesiguranței în propria ta ființă. Dacă suferiți de acest tip de dependență, trebuie să mergeți la originea rădăcinii poveștii voastre și să iertați ceea ce trebuie iertat în voi, să vindecați copilul interior și să nu luați viața drept pedeapsă sau suferință, trebuie să lucrați la împuternicire , smerenie, apreciere și mai presus de toate, iubire de sine.""

Dar Gabriela Ruse merită să fie preamărită cu nemiluita. Fata asta pare însăși definiția romantică a sportivului. Constituție ideală, atitudine, determinare, mentalitate și o nerăbdare pozitivă de a face lucrurile întotdeauna mai bine. Plus transpirație, a se citi muncă, nu Gabriel Cotabiță. Românca pare genul care e gata să rezolve orice conflict din viață prin sport. Ne certăm în trafic că ești din afara Clujului și mi-ai tăiat calea? Bun, hai să facem un sprint de o sută de metri și să vedem cine are dreptate. Te-ai băgat în față la măcelărie sau la policlinică? Nu e bai, hai să ieșim afară și să lămurim care dintre noi execută mai multe flotări. Probabil că dacă are nopți cu somn tulburat, Gabi a noastră iese rapid la o repriză de jogging, ca să nu aibă timpi morți.” • Cronicile semifinalelor de la Transylvania Open se citesc aici: https://mirceamester.ro/rebeka-masarova-gabriela-ruse-1-6-4-6/ • Powered by Porsche Romania.",,1123,"{'like_count': 964, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 25926}",Meșter,,2023-10-21 17:06:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/309885492_670201427809206_4778583595848620328_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=VTJ8ka4DOYAAX_Am7dc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCIOiEQYvudSb_a_Mci8epaVt4LP9GUsWiw4i7UoESbZg&oe=655A67AD,https://www.facebook.com/100044580632930/posts/901966981299315,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/18432134196165534744?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fads%2Fimage%2F%3Fd%3DAQI1YmbyQclM8YLY2AQ4n2NkSQX6aZLpPVRnFtHDcYh8WY4iuWZ_8RnV0HoyQduO3ynHoqfJ3DBm4Bj_-CgllVgMmH8Dy9WsL3OOo0AreXZtJTIj_zGIhDz0jeUsolGQMZUc9ms_5mEmTAzeVWuzFdtC&fb_obo=1&utld=facebook.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbGzPeBOvh9DT5tDp2X2lwOSNzwCP0dE--P_vyYKDtwWUg&oe=6535A3A2

facebook,"London’s Metropolitan Police on Friday said they will not be arresting anyone chanting a popular slogan used by Palestinian activists during demonstrations. The slogan in question, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, is commonly heard at solidarity marches and refers to the area of historic Palestine between the River Tiberias and the Mediterranean Sea. Pro-Israel groups claim it is antisemitic because it is an implicit call for the destruction of Israel, a charge rejected by Palestinian activists. The police force’s guidance comes ahead of what are expected to be large demonstrations in support of Palestinians on Saturday. Passions have been running high in the UK as the conflict in Gaza rages on. Palestinian activists have previously expressed concerns about the criminalisation of political expression and free speech when it comes to criticising Israel. Earlier in October, British Home Secretary Suella Braverman advised police forces across the country to look into the possibility of whether the waving of Palestinian flags amounted to a criminal offence. “Behaviours that are legitimate in some circumstances, for example, the waving of a Palestinian flag, may not be legitimate such as when intended to glorify acts of terrorism,” she wrote in a letter to police chiefs. As things stand, under British law, expressions of support for proscribed groups, such as Hamas or Hezbollah, can lead to arrest with the possibility of fines and prison sentences for those convicted of an offence. The civil rights group Liberty has condemned what it calls the government’s attack on “the ability to stand up for what we believe in is our fundamental right”. “Recent government responses to protests relating to Israel and Palestine are an attack on that right, and an attempt to erode the way we can make our voices heard,” the group said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter.",,963,"{'like_count': 503, 'comment_count': 215, 'num_users': 1921391}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-21 05:29:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/291028422_410373144459463_4151778888964342317_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=L1wHiXsOmuAAX_kDcgS&_nc_oc=AQl7Cxb6m4E9oWWRaloZ7VPqwBvyKZPvKffsiwmDWPSw9jL9lWoagfjiwVjGa9XoJfw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBef7B_qtzmlJDR_6rsQa6JMwcf30uorWT7fdel2xySVA&oe=655AEB02,https://www.facebook.com/100064603425232/posts/733350265495081,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392891210_733350228828418_7998774061050676600_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=KHiSx64JMeAAX_fAcSF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfChOSUmBlNnIcwJ_hy926ieR8J-WGB2rWhsuR-xz4S42A&oe=655A2D18

facebook,"Marilyn and Arthur Miller I have often read very negative opinions about Arthur Miller, described as an austere, arrogant, even manipulative being who would have underestimated Marilyn and would have done her a lot of harm. The press went so far as to suggest that Arthur Miller had married Marilyn for his money or for good publicity when he refused to appoint communists to the Committee on Un-American Activities, during the time of McCarthyism. Furthermore, he did not attend her funeral because he had the impression that his service would be a “circus” and that is what it was according to many observers. It is tempting to loathe Miller. Personally, I always thought that these strong opinions did not take one thing into account: in a couple, expectations are on both sides and it is sometimes difficult or impossible to satisfy them. Many of us Marilyn admirers deeply sympathize with what Marilyn must have felt when she read the words Miller wrote in his diary (in 1956). He confided his annoyance there, but also a certain disappointment with his new wife, whom he considered childish and too vulnerable. Above all, he feared that his work as a writer would be seriously parasitized by the energy he spent constantly comforting her. Indeed, for four months, Arthur had spent most of his time psychologically supporting his wife, in open conflict with director Laurence Olivier on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl. The writer was unable to work on his own projects. We can imagine the shock that was, for this indeed fragile woman, the discovery of this notebook, forgotten one day wide open on the table of their London residence... What if Miller, himself an artist, a fallible human, hadn't been strong enough to protect her from her demons? What if it was almost impossible to reassure Marilyn in the long term? What if he hadn't known how to respond to the unlimited need for love and recognition she needed? What if we also gave Arthur Miller a chance to explain himself? For those interested in the subject, you can read the following article (in french) on the letter that Arthur sent to his parents about his “failed” marriage; it was sent by the playwright's nephew to the editorial staff of the American media Air Mail in October 2022. https://madame.lefigaro.fr/celebrites/cinema/elle-etait-comme-un-vase-brise-la-lettre-inedite-d-arthur-miller-sur-son-mariage-rate-avec-marilyn-monroe-20221103 And above all, read the pages devoted to Marilyn in his book Timebends: a life where he speaks about her in the most moving way possible.",,682,"{'like_count': 421, 'comment_count': 107, 'num_users': 361837}",Marilyn Monroe,,2023-10-21 21:27:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/396723174_10159250539392553_3425091684518762650_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XdWC6gkzO-QAX8865a6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBERl_57zL2VDmfoobOycjO0J6eHmMhQb5x2zppdYrAYg&oe=6559B9A0,https://www.facebook.com/groups/31246488000/permalink/10161151669988001,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394364804_7330085900354396_7154468797583132406_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4gK0EepP9KcAX81aFUQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCEMG0CkmC_SA2jB7EY5R3gQU4TkHP-wFs_PhDkZ0chbg&oe=653981BA

facebook,"Israel is finalising the closure of Al Jazeera over its coverage of the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which it says is helping Hamas. The Qatar-based network is the biggest Arabic language news outlet providing televised and online updates on the situation in Gaza, within Israel and in other occupied Palestinian territories. On Friday, a number of Israeli media outlets, including i24 News and Times of Israel, said that the Israeli government had approved “emergency regulations” that would shutter broadcasters that are deemed to be acting against the “security of the state”. The Times of Israel quoted Israeli Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi who said Israel was at war on “land, in the air, at sea, and on the public diplomacy front”. Before the ban on the network is enacted, it will need approval from Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who is expected to sign the regulation. Although floated as temporary, the ban can be renewed at 30-day intervals. The move against Al Jazeera comes amid a wider crackdown on opposing views within Israel. Karhi has also proposed targeting any journalist, including Israelis, who are deemed to be “harming national morale”. Journalists and other citizens could have their homes searched, property seized and could be placed under arrest for speech the government deems undesirable. On the international front, Israeli public diplomacy accounts have condemned media outlets for getting their news from “terrorist organisations”. Al Jazeera has a vast operation within Gaza, which will likely continue to broadcast out of the besieged territory. The network has a frosty relationship with Israel despite being one of the first in the region to interview Israeli figures on-air. In 2022, Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot dead by an Israeli soldier while reporting in Jenin. The network most recently condemned Israel for a missile attack on a group of journalists in Lebanon, which included its own reporters.",,657,"{'like_count': 161, 'comment_count': 129, 'num_users': 1921391}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-21 04:30:37,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/291028422_410373144459463_4151778888964342317_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=L1wHiXsOmuAAX_kDcgS&_nc_oc=AQl7Cxb6m4E9oWWRaloZ7VPqwBvyKZPvKffsiwmDWPSw9jL9lWoagfjiwVjGa9XoJfw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBef7B_qtzmlJDR_6rsQa6JMwcf30uorWT7fdel2xySVA&oe=655AEB02,https://www.facebook.com/100064603425232/posts/733331358830305,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392885059_733331325496975_5295018859140649940_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=o8To7xNgEeIAX8YXSwE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA5C0QSwUHNd4ODWWv4i1hNjz8AykjbY4_Ut2lZXCJYQw&oe=653DFC0A
facebook,"As 20 aid trucks arrived at a UN storage facility in central Gaza on Saturday, October 21, uncertainty loomed for the 2.3 million people still blockaded there. It’s been two weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing close to 1,400 people in coordinated attacks that prompted devastating Israeli retaliation and increased tensions around the world. Israel said it would its increase strikes on Gaza, starting Saturday. Hamas is holding as many as 200 hostages it kidnapped during the attacks, and says 50 more captives are being held by other armed groups inside Gaza. Hamas previously said 20 hostages were killed by Israeli air strikes, without providing details. Two American hostages were released by Hamas Friday and handed over to Israeli authorities after Qatar helped mediate their release. In addition to Israeli hostages, Hamas is also holding citizens of Thailand, Argentina, Britain, Germany, France and Portugal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed ‘mighty vengeance’ for the Oct. 7 massacre. A ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces could come at any time. More than 4300 Palestinian people, including women and children, have been killed in the retaliatory attacks. Demonstrations around the world show deep divisions in communities supporting Palestinian and Israeli civilians. The U.S. has affirmed support for Israel’s right to defend itself, but officials have expressed doubt that Israel has crafted an endgame to the conflict that threatens to draw in other countries and divide the world. Arab leaders at a Cairo summit on Saturday condemned the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. With Israel and the U.S. absent from the summit, no agreement was made toward how to contain the violence. “The message the Arab world is hearing is that Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli ones,” Jordan’s King Abdullah said, adding he was outraged and grieved by acts of violence waged against innocent civilians. Gulf Cooperation Council and ASEAN countries called for a durable ceasefire, the immediate release of civilian hostages and detainees, and a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. China’s special envoy on Middle East affairs has also called for efforts to implement a two-state solution and promote an early, comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question. France called for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza that it said could lead to a ceasefire. Britain and Germany both urged Israel’s military to show restraint. Israel has vowed to wipe the Iranian-backed Hamas militant group “off the face of the earth.” #CGTNAmerica",,646,"{'like_count': 393, 'comment_count': 34, 'num_users': 121062286}",CGTN,,2023-10-21 20:32:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/240501168_398442308315914_1975708148483497397_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fqFJPm2ePcQAX_EttAj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmpHfEtK6PszswEM-kc4fo5ZDurnAeUaRWl6uD79W1bw&oe=655A1719,https://www.facebook.com/100044504436603/posts/975006207326185,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394582976_975005740659565_4840581126862860429_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=dBEme1jQAKMAX8U3DtW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBRcU4GI0LQ9tYkqs5ZZmzWeqKM-AnUpJ0HDrU73_CWyg&oe=653B90C8

facebook,"“Approach plugged culvert as a water problem, not a beaver problem.” -Former MDIFW Wildlife Technician, Jim Dorso When humans see a road with a culvert in a wetland, they see a path across, but a beaver sees a dam with a leak. Plugged culverts are the most common conflict with beavers. Simply removing a beaver would only be a temporary fix until another beaver comes along to use the same habitat and fix the same leak. Removal of beaver would also eliminate an integral component of healthy aquatic ecosystems. Beavers are ecosystem engineers whose behavior modifies habitat, creating space and resources for countless other species. Site modification is an alternative approach which produces long-term and cost-effective solutions for chronic problems by simultaneously addressing current conflict and minimizing future conflict, all while preserving quality wetland habitat produced by beavers. Seen here, MDIFW and U.S. Department of Agriculture biologists train University of Maine students in the implementation of a site modification device known as a beaver deceiver. This device denies access to culverts which maintains normal water flow and eliminates the need for constant maintenance. It also encourages dam placement upstream from the culvert and maintains a water level that is acceptable for both humans and beavers. Everybody wins!

facebook,"Israel released video footage Friday of night attacks across Gaza, saying it hit over a hundred operational targets of 'terrorist organizations' in the Gaza Strip.   The Israel Defense Forces posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: “During the night, fighter jets attacked over a hundred operational targets of the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, destroying tunnel shafts, munitions warehouses and dozens of operational headquarters.”   Meanwhile, Israel is planning to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona. Authorities said Friday that the town’s residents will be placed in state-funded guest houses. The northern city is located near Israel’s border with Lebanon and has been subjected to numerous rocket and missile attacks from Palestinian militant groups.   British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak travels Friday to Egypt, his latest Middle Eastern destination, as the conflict continues to grow. Sunak has already met with Israeli leaders and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.   Sunak followed U.S. President Joe Biden with a visit to Israel to demonstrate Western support for the war against Hamas militants.  https://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-convoy-into-gaza-delayed/7319008.html",,632,"{'like_count': 182, 'comment_count': 297, 'num_users': 13090753}",Voice of America,,2023-10-21 00:00:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352992991_178766095145684_5027481947854717491_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=18ZZdScV7x8AX_v3UtK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA-0oRGDfzOgJKAktJbxD6u7JzyNcJUAbbN0bpHjZ8-Q&oe=655A6AC2,https://www.facebook.com/100064458353336/posts/716033367221935,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/394461294_1371266603796342_8076956540242924565_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=gnIycjoVNBIAX-aC-EW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAl4rKZqg8xH8dGeQL-LHmXeodlThRMz6RtT23WgNjvsA&oe=65397970

facebook,"MY REFLECTIONS FOR TODAY (Sunday October 22 2023) Text: ""I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you,"" (Genesis 12:3). Today is a SPECIAL FOCUS on why Christians should stand with Israel now. Much has been said about the current conflict in the Middle East which the world is trying to portray as between Israel and the Palestinians. There needs to be moral clarity here. ISRAEL’S WAR IS NOT AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS BUT AGAINST A CRUEL, BRUTAL AND MURDEROUS TERRORIST GROUP CALLED HAMAS IN GAZA. Israel must destroy Hamas now. It’s now or never! Why should Christians stand with Israel now? 1. Israel, like any sovereign state has the right to defend itself from any forms of attacks against its citizens. Imagine if Cairo, the capital of Egypt was attacked by any enemy forces! Should Egypt take up arms and defend its sovereign territory and its people? Absolutely! No country on earth would stand idly by and do nothing. It is morally right to do so. That’s exactly what Israel is doing now. What would you do as a nation when over 1,400 of your innocent civilians were murdered in broad daylight, paraded on the streets, their throats slit and taken hostages? Israel has the right to protect the life of its citizens from any threats from within or outside. Israel is fighting against an evil force right within its doorstep. 2. Hamas promotes violence and death. In fact, it glorifies violence and death when it comes to Jews. In its charter, Hamas declares, “Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.” When you compare Israel and Hamas, Israel seeks to protect life and freedom among its citizens, and the other is a religious theocracy whose very charter resolves to annihilate any who do not adhere to its religion. Hamas is on record for killing its own people and use them as human shields. While Israel is fulfilling God’s intended purpose for a nation, Hamas is actively working against that purpose. Israel is using its military force to do what God designed nations to do, while Hamas is killing simply out of hatred. The conclusion for Christian should be clear: We ought to support Israel and not Hamas. 3. We live at a time when the church is called to be Israel’s strongest ally amid an emergence of nations possessing a demonically driven desire to see the Jewish people eradicated. Study the resolutions of the UN Security Council and the UN Human Rights Commission and you will see their deep-seated hatred against the State of Israel. Anti-semitism (hatred against Jews) is on the rise all over the world like never before. There are only about 16 million Jews all over the world (about 7-8 million live in Israel). There are not many of them. If the world is against the Jews, who will stand with them? 4. The church should stand with Israel because you need to be on the right side of history. In the final analysis, Israel will prevail because the God of Israel rules and reigns over the affairs of men and he will defend his people. That’s’ the bottom line. You don’t want to be on the wrong side fighting against God. YOU WILL NEVER WIN IF YOU DO! God will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse her.

facebook,"Château de Chevenon: A Timeless Elegance In the heart of Burgundy, where the rolling hills are cloaked in vineyards and whispers of history echo through the vine-covered walls, there stands a majestic testament to time's grace and human ingenuity. The Château de Chevenon, nestled amid the picturesque French countryside, is a place where history intertwines with architecture, and stories of passion and intrigue lurk in every corner. Let me take you on a captivating journey through the annals of Château de Chevenon, a place that has seen centuries unfold and empires rise and fall. A Whisper of the Past The story of the Château de Chevenon begins in the 12th century, where the threads of history were first woven into its very foundations. It was constructed during a time of turmoil and conflict, a time when fortresses like Chevenon were essential to safeguard against marauding invaders. The castle's stone walls, robust and impenetrable, were designed not only to withstand the test of time but to bear witness to history as it unfolded. With each passing century, the castle underwent several transformations, reflecting the architectural trends and tastes of its inhabitants. Over time, it transcended its original role as a military stronghold, evolving into an elegant château, a symbol of luxury and power. Today, its architecture stands as a testament to the eras it has witnessed, from medieval fortifications to Renaissance opulence and beyond. The Legacy of Aristocracy Throughout its storied history, the Château de Chevenon has hosted a cast of characters, each leaving their indelible mark on its stone walls. Among them, the illustrious de Châtillon family, whose connection with the château spanned centuries. This noble lineage, tracing its roots to the Crusades and beyond, held the keys to this enchanting fortress for generations. One cannot help but envision the grandeur of medieval banquets, the clinking of goblets filled with the finest Burgundy wine, and the resounding laughter of lords and ladies echoing through the great hall. The de Châtillon family were no strangers to opulence, and Chevenon bore witness to their extravagant feasts and lavish celebrations. But history is never a straightforward narrative; it is more like a tapestry, woven with both brilliance and shadows. The Château de Chevenon was not exempt from the turbulent times that plagued France during the Hundred Years' War, when it became a pawn in a perilous game of territorial ambitions. It changed hands multiple times, each time a new chapter in its story, a new layer added to its rich tapestry. Renaissance Revival The château's most captivating chapter began during the Renaissance, an era that witnessed a renaissance of not only art and culture but also the Château de Chevenon itself. The Renaissance brought a profound transformation in architectural style, as the stern fortifications of old gave way to the opulent, graceful lines of the French Renaissance. The renowned architect Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau left his distinctive mark on the Château de Chevenon, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication. Du Cerceau's work combined the beauty of the Italian Renaissance with the precision of French craftsmanship, resulting in a breathtaking fusion of styles. The château's façade adorned with delicate stone carvings, spiral staircases, and intricate ceilings offered a glimpse of the Renaissance's artistic glory. The château's gardens, inspired by the meticulous designs of André Le Nôtre, unfolded in geometric splendor, showcasing the mastery of both architecture and nature. As you stroll through these meticulously landscaped gardens, adorned with colorful blooms and tranquil fountains, you can almost feel the spirits of long-lost nobility whispering their secrets. Whispers of Intrigue and Romance Among the myriad tales that have graced the château's history, none are as beguiling as the stories of love and passion that unfolded within its walls. Lovers' trysts in hidden chambers, secret correspondences sent with the utmost discretion, and clandestine meetings in moonlit gardens – the Château de Chevenon witnessed the blossoming of many a forbidden romance. One of the most captivating stories is that of the tragic love between a young, passionate French noblewoman and an English soldier during the Hundred Years' War. Their love defied the boundaries of nationality and class, much like Romeo and Juliet, and ended in heartbreak that still resonates through the château's halls. The château's walls, thick and silent, guard the secrets of love affairs, betrayals, and tender moments hidden away from the prying eyes of the world. As you explore its dimly lit corridors and hidden alcoves, you can almost feel the weight of these whispered secrets, carried through the centuries.

facebook,"29th SUNDAY OF ORDINARY TIME “A” Is 45: 1. 4-6 ; Ps 95 ; 1Thess 1: 1-5 ; Mt 22: 15-21 The Church and the State; temporal authority and spiritual authority. The Church is often criticized for crossing its outline when it speeches about politics. The Christian, citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven, nevertheless finds himself in a society, a State in which he has both rights and duties. Can he worry about the heaven and act as the earth did not exist? Jesus is once more in front of Pharisees this Sunday. After teaching them parables, the Pharisees understood that they were the target of these parables. So they are angry and looking for a way to put him to death. This is why they choose to trap Jesus with a question. And we see how they begin with kindnesses to introduce their trap: ""Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men."" After this introduction, barely hiding their deviousness, they set the trap: ""Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"" Let us remember that Jesus was in front of two groups: the Pharisees who knew that the Messiah would come to establish the Kingdom of God. So if Jesus answers ""Yes"", they will find a reason to accuse him as an imposter and a friend of the power of Rome, which will lead the crowd to kill him. But we also have the Herodians who are supporters of the power of Rome. And if Jesus answers ""No"", they will hand him over to the Governor as a resistance fighter or secessionist, which will also lead to his death sentence. In both cases, Jesus will die. But Christ takes this opportunity to teach them about the relation between political authority and divine authority: ""Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."" This affirmation of Christ has three consequences: • All authority comes from God. There is no conflict between God's authority and political authority. There is therefore no question here of seeing two powers confronting each other. This is what we observe in the Book of Isaiah. Israel is still in captivity in Babylon. But they already hear about a conquering king (Cyrus, king of Persia) who defeats all the kingdoms. Soon Babylon will fall. It is in this climate that Isaiah announces wonderful news to his brothers. They have to take courage because God has chosen Cyrus from a far land to deliver his people: ""Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and ungird the loins of kings, to open doors before him that gates may not be closed […] For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I surname you, though you do not know me. I am the LORD, and there is no other, besides me there is no God; I gird you, though you do not know me."" We thus see that God chooses a pagan king to consecrate him as Messiah and send him to free his people. And precisely, Cyrus will send the captives of Israel back to their native land and give them resources to rebuild the town and the Temple. The episode of Cyrus makes us understand that God even uses pagan authority to accomplish his purposes. That is why Christians have to pray for politic authorities as Saint Paul wishes: ""I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life…"" (1Tm 2: 1-2). Then the political authority must put itself at the service of God. Jesus will say to Pilate: ""You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above."" (Jn 19:11). • Political authority and spiritual authority are all at the service of man. All of them work for the well-being of men and justice in the world. If the State has the duty to ensure the material well-being of all men, the Church's mission is to lead men to the heavenly city. It is in this sense that Pope Leo XIII will say: ""Hallowed, therefore, in the minds of Christians is the very idea of public authority, in which they recognize some likeness and symbol as it were of the Divine Majesty, even when it is exercised by one unworthy. A just and due reverence to the laws abides in them, not from force and threats, but from a consciousness of duty"" (Sapientiae Christianae n° 9). Thus no society can ignore the collaboration between the State and Religion. Today we live in a society that looks a way for destroying religion. But a society without God is a society without morality and a society without morality is a society which tends towards its own death. That is the case of Babylon, which initially shone with supreme glory, ended up being destroyed by Persia. • The Christian is therefore called to put things in their places. The Christian has to fulfil his civic duties, but never forget that supreme worship belongs to God. He must be a perfect and honest citizen. He lives in a society with its rules and precepts. He (truncated)",,526,"{'like_count': 413, 'comment_count': 78, 'num_users': 41642}",Père Gabriel Honoré Lissouck II,,2023-10-21 17:05:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/349495312_1039610003687102_4435958040902252394_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ovhU_K6fOasAX8hAV9-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBgHINUshjoutTd5csDwiDWHkN0_j4MblIdT6cUfXKgrg&oe=655A628E,https://www.facebook.com/100063740194528/posts/857419046392761,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394443192_857419019726097_3908239536467583621_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=TlEgHfKKEokAX8i9lia&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBZnyrHdRgV_E69iVdxDHqVzC7jXDAmvwDhRcGgs0tfug&oe=65396F28

facebook,"Geronimo was an Apache leader and medicine man best known for his fearlessness in resisting anyone–Mexican or American—who attempted to remove his people from their tribal lands. He repeatedly evaded capture and life on a reservation, and during his final escape, a full quarter of the U.S. standing army pursued him and his followers. Here are some interesting facts about Geronimo that you may not know: 1. The origins of his name are disputed. The man who would become the most feared Indian leader of the 19th century was born sometime in the 1820s into the Bedonkohe, the smallest band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe that inhabited what is now New Mexico and Arizona. His given name was Goyahkla (“The One Who Yawns”), but as a young man he earned the moniker “Geronimo” after distinguishing himself in Apache raids against the Mexicans. The source of the name remains the subject of debate. Some historians believed it arose from frightened Mexican soldiers invoking the Catholic St. Jerome when facing the warrior in battle, while others argue that it was simply a Mexican nickname or a mispronunciation of “Goyahkla.” 2. Geronimo’s wife and children were murdered when he was a young man. Geronimo came of age during a period of bitter conflict between the Chiricahua Apaches and the Mexicans. In response to the Apaches’ penchant for staging raids to gather horses and provisions, the Mexican government had begun ambushing Apache settlements and offering lucrative bounties for their scalps. In 1851, while Geronimo and several other warriors were in the town of Janos on a trading mission, Colonel Jose Maria Carrasco and a detachment of around 400 Mexican soldiers ransacked his Bedonkohe encampment and slaughtered many of its inhabitants. When Geronimo returned later that night, he found that his mother, his wife and his three young children had all been murdered. 3. He broke out of U.S. Indian reservations on three different occasions. In the 1840s and 1850s, the Mexican-American War and the Gadsden Purchase placed the Chiricahua Apaches’ domain within the boundaries of the expanding United States. Geronimo and the Apaches violently resisted the influx of white settlers, but following several years of war with the U.S. Army, they reluctantly negotiated a peace. By 1876, most of the Chiricahuas had been shipped to San Carlos, an arid and inhospitable reservation located in Arizona. Geronimo avoided the reservation until 1877, when he was captured by Indian agents and brought to San Carlos in chains. 4. He was an accomplished artist who sold paintings to tourists late in life. 5. He was also an accomplished horseman who could ride standing up on two horses at once. 6. He died at Fort Sill, Oklahoma on February 17th, 1909.

Het Midden-Oosten, wereldhistorie, ontstaan Religies, koningshuizen, politiek, geschiedenis, en alle ellende eromheen van liters bloed vergieten. Hier is de grond waar Jezus aan het kruis werd gehangen en waar hij opstond uit zijn graf, de Heilig Grafkerk, de bronnen van de Bijbel, maar ook de Islam Koran liggen hier, profeet Mohammed steeg op uit de Rotskoepel op de Tempelberg. In jaar 638 werd Jeruzalem geislamiseerd. De El Aksamoskee meest heilige Moskee gelijk met de Kabaa in Mekka. Geschiedenis zou uitwijzen dat tijdens de kruistochten jaar 1099 tienduizenden moslims werden onthoofd (complete gezinnen) in de moskee, een slachtpartij met bloed tot aan de enkels...een gruwelijke geschiedenis.. Ook de Joden komen hier voor de heilige klaagmuur, alles wat over is van de ooit vernielde Joodse Tempel. Alles komt hier samen op een heilige lap grond, waar geen Westerse toerist nog heen durft vanwege het nieuws, alle conflicten eromheen het Israël Palestina conflict die elkaar al een eeuw de tent uitvechten over een domme verdeling van gebieden, en natuurlijk religies en achtergrond Jodendom en Islam.

facebook,"The Power of Ra, The Galactic Confederation and why the Great Experiment on Earth was created
 (Part 1)

The first humans were Lyran and Sirian in our universal matrix bubble. Conflict broke out in the Cradle of Lyra (the Lyran constellation) between the negatively polarised Orion races and the Lyrans. This lead to heavy and long drawn out conflict which we know as the Orion wars (which is what the Star Wars movie series is about). The Orions/Draco invaded the Lyran system corrupting their social memory complex and in the process 50 million souls were lost in the destruction of 3 planets (Bila,Teka and Merok). The negative Orion/Draco factions sided with the dark (black sun) Empire which were 95% oriented towards the service to self polarity whilst the Lyran/Sirians followed the Law of One and the rays (Ray – Ra) of light that were of a service to others/ unity consciousness. Christ is a shortened version of Christos that translates as man and hu-man which means the light of man. Man is Ra; the pathway to the light.

 The universal matrix conforms to the light cube (Ra) and dark cube (Satan) to form the YHVH duality matrix. The YHVH Metatronic grid gives beings the choice to choose their consciousness via the flower of life sacred geometry held within our DNA blueprint. In gematria YHVH equates to 26 (Y=10 H=5 V=6 H=5) as does man (m=1 a=12 n=13). 26 divided into the two polarities gives you 13. The 13th portal is the gateway back to either the light of God (golden dawn via the heart) or the false god (of the qliphoth) depending on what path you choose to walk in your evolutionary soul journey. 26 condensed down in numerology gives you 8 by adding the 2 and 6 together. 8 is the symbol for infinity which connects to the 8th dimensional portal of Orion that holds the library of all things (infinite torus of the akashic records data field) and connects to the black hole void portal of god “Hunab Ku”. 8 also aligns to the 8 points that connect up to the light and dark 3D cube of our reality (Kabbalah tree of life/death) that holds our vibrations through the 3 dimensions of height, width and depth. The 144 vibrations within Metatron’s cube contains the full spectrum of light and dark that can be separated by the 4 elements and pillars (earth, water, fire, and air) of the square shape geometry (2D) to use for positive or negative purposes. Light cube =4, dark cube = 4 connected to the 1 infinitive creator through the ether = 144. 144 divided by 2 = 72. 72 light vibrations (god of light 7+2=9. 9 the dimension of God and the higher self/higher mind) and 72 dark vibrations (false god self and ego lower self/lower mind).

The Dark Orion Empire commanding forces were known as Sith Lords or dominator-victimizers. The Orion Resistance known as the Black League fought against the Empire but many of them fell to darkness or became enslaved by the dominators. Some of the members of the Resistance were Ray (Ra) Masters of the light that held potent dragon energy (Kumara Dragons) but still managed to become corrupted through killing in dualistic battles, thus heavily shifting their vibrations to alter their states of consciousness towards the negative polarity. The Dark Orion Empire used victimizer mind technology also referred to as Armageddon software to hijack beings of light, submitting them to darkness and slavery through deep fear holographic implants/destructive false memories seeded in the unconscious mind. The Draco reptilians and their Orion allies on Rigel used their advanced war weaponry and mind control technology to infiltrate and enslave native inhabitants in 21 star systems.

The Lyrans and Vegans were a peaceful human and feline civilization that developed agriculture on several planets and thrived in their service to others mentality. They weren’t expecting the attacks from the reptilians but even whilst unprepared, still they fought back. Some of the wars lead to a truce between certain reptilian and human/feline groups which saw them cohabitate with one another peacefully and even started interbreeding. This is how I believe the cat/feline species got the reptilian eye genetics as a result of this hybridisation. These were the reptilian factions that managed to break away from the Empire and choose their own path (Kalask and Morkul). 

The tyranny of the Orion onslaught grew too powerful for the Lyrans to handle and so they fled Lyra to colonize new human civilizations on other planets such as Acturus, the Pleiades, Cygnus Alpha, Antares, Cassiopeia, Alpha Centauri and Andromeda to name a few. Humans spread across 110 different star systems, developing their own spiritual practices and technologies in their new evolutionary cycles. The original Lyran refugees fled to the Zenetae star system in the Andromedan Galaxy. Lyra is the 12th Gate that connects directly to Andromeda. When Lyra was taken over and partly destroyed, in the process of its fall, its natural kryst (christ) codes and krystal (truncated)",,490,"{'like_count': 228, 'comment_count': 85, 'num_users': 104173}","Keepers of the Light: Arcturians, Pleiadians, Andromedans.",,2023-10-21 16:29:34,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/336682432_1371128353733019_5742369270925593118_n.jpg?stp=c42.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rn4Mexoz9ngAX_VdlyI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCkLhDWm_o9NJZwQAif4Rgjx8Zzm73SfHBSgTvjpgAR9Q&oe=655A0EFF,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1653142991369191/permalink/7623682544315176,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/279163137_121726010502176_6440335059902457437_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QMqHWYgt9hcAX-FSGhx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAgmrA5a1c1ZHrti7bZyBqp3bfMghq9LswDN61dW_HRKw&oe=6539ECA0
facebook,"Animals Of War Challenge Over 16 million animals served in the First World War. They were used for transport, communication and companionship. In 1914, both sides had large cavalry forces. Horse and camel-mounted troops were used in the desert campaigns throughout the war, but on the Western Front, new weapons like the machine gun made cavalry charges increasingly difficult. However, animals remained a crucial part of the war effort. Horses, donkeys, mules and camels carried food, water, ammunition and medical supplies to men at the front, and dogs and pigeons carried messages. Canaries were used to detect poisonous gas, and cats and dogs were trained to hunt rats in the trenches. Animals were not only used for work. Dogs, cats, and more unusual animals including monkeys, bears and lions, were kept as pets and mascots to raise morale and provide comfort amidst the hardships of war. £3 FROM EVERY MEDAL WILL BE DONATED TO WARPAWS: War Paws was created to provide a voice and make the difference for the forgotten animals of war. We feel that the only way to make the difference that is needed is not to just try and remove the animals from war zones and areas of civil conflict, but instead, we aim to provide education for the local populations, provide information and encouragement on better animal welfare and animal husbandry and to promote happy and healthy ownership of animals. https://racethedistance.com/collections/all-current-challenges/products/animals-of-war-challenge-2023:=:https://racethedistance.com/products/animals-of-war-challenge-2023 #virtualrun #warpaws #armistice #running",,482,"{'like_count': 268, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 51299}",Race The Distance,,2023-10-21 10:25:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/307454473_458108399676528_1468727608678464047_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=5cl8yBYveKUAX-5V6Jz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDA84askYam43ngJHG7efhIZhW5L5TsQgMydEYhBqJw4g&oe=655B83E0,https://www.facebook.com/100064321164189/posts/737232198430812,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/12648316047475751608?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fads%2Fimage%2F%3Fd%3DAQK2jtm5Sibysv7-tGLJjz3TCepe5IIrWqwekrmOJAwCLIWlqCNfmYl4C6xPe_P00dMWR4eg9tIpBeEHncExUamkn3VVDFm_qQFBOjA-emi8MNxurq1SsF0sA4fcN9rGBH0XuISaqAoxips7NmyirB1f&fb_obo=1&utld=facebook.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbGiz0jNpvfVYC2QPdEnzer-wA4-_ceQfFwKQrRWfps07g&oe=654561C1

facebook,"Wooden Leg: A Warrior Who Fought Custer is a 1931 book by Thomas Bailey Marquis about the life of a Northern Cheyenne Indian, Wooden Leg, who fought in several historic battles between United States forces and the Plains Indians, including the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where he faced the troops of George Armstrong Custer. The book is of great value to historians, not only for its eyewitness accounts of battles, but also for its detailed description of the way of life of 19th-century Plains Indians. The book was dictated to Marquis by Wooden Leg in Plains Indian Sign Language, their only common language. Marquis gathered the stories for the book from Wooden Leg and others while he was physician at the agency in Montana from 1922. They were reluctant to open up to him at first, but eventually Marquis gained their trust. Wooden Leg lived through some of the most turbulent times in Cheyenne history, but the book begins with his childhood and descriptions of Cheyenne customs. These include tribal organisation, the warrior societies, sport, religion and mythology, their friendship and cooperation with the Sioux, arrow recognition, warbonnet entitlement, and much more. Wooden Leg was introduced to warfare at a very young age via conflict with the Crow and joined the Elk warrior society at age 14. The book describes Wooden Leg's participation in the important battles of the war of 1876–1877, when the Cheyenne, Sioux, and other plains tribes fought the United States. These included not only the Little Big Horn, but the preceding Battle of the Rosebud and the succeeding Dull Knife Fight. Following the Cheyenne surrender, the tribe was deported to Oklahoma, but eventually Wooden Leg was allowed to return. At Fort Keogh he worked as a scout for the army and was later appointed a judge at the Tongue River Indian Reservation. Wooden Leg describes in detail how he befriended the old chief Little Wolf towards the end of the latter's life. Little Wolf had been a great war leader but was now ostracised for having killed another Cheyenne while drunk. Wooden Leg's description of the Battle of the Little Bighorn caused controversy when the book was first published, particularly his claim that many of the US soldiers committed suicide. This claim is still discussed by scholars and has been investigated by archeologists, but no firm conclusions have been reached.",,421,"{'like_count': 343, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 72773}",Native American DNA,,2023-10-21 07:35:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/364124943_601335562160970_586042433955214086_n.jpg?stp=c0.11.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bMoXvZrDSK8AX9jFNMW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD2pbgCtaN4TJPJ_LtVjLKl2RoT_9cZa4PzZtqr1ri0sA&oe=655B7FE2,https://www.facebook.com/100068535938640/posts/642266218067904,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393013159_641717048122821_292572217636712470_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=N2B9gXnFTeAAX_B5cCD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAI3rksKJ8UpuARR6qPFYztFwKHAYgKauRL7kPRsPNVvg&oe=65597F6B

facebook,"HOW TO DETECT AN ADVANCED SOUL. Advanced souls have characteristics that are very different from ordinary human beings. They manifest beyond conventional wisdom.... Advanced souls have these 12 traits:.... ♨️1. THEY HAVE A PENETRATING LOOK. When advanced souls look at you, you feel like they are looking through your soul. His gaze is so deep that it penetrates deep into your core. His eyes are constant and do not move much. They are fully aware of what is inside and outside of you. His eyes shine with the light of deep peace, compassion, love and wisdom... 2. ♨️THEY HAVE A SOFT AND COMFORTING TOUCH. Its touch is very light on the skin and seems to bring healing to someone who is suffering from any problem in different aspects of life. They heal the soul in a unique way... 3. ♨️THEY HAVE A SOFT AND CALMING VOICE. When they speak, they do so with depth and refinement in their voice. They offer instructions that are wise and conflict-free, they know how to best guide you in where to direct your life. When asked, their answers carry a ring of truth and bring clarity that eliminates their confusions. Despite their soft nature, they are also firm in their convictions and decisions... 4. ♨️HIS AURA IS VERY DEEP AND SILENT. They exude an air of tranquility. His presence is very comforting and makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. They are so calm that you find yourself feeling so at peace with them as if nothing negative could take away that peace of mind. Although they are normally calm, their strong presence speaks loudly... 5. ♨️ THEY ARE SINCERE IN ALL THEIR INTERACTIONS. Because advanced souls are deeply aware and aware beings, they act and speak sincerely and calmly. They cannot be expected to be false, since their spirit is guided by wisdom and knowledge, humility and love... 6. ♨️THEY WILL GLADLY SHOW THE WAY, BUT THEY WILL NEVER IMPOSE IT. They show others the path to enlightenment in a way that is not imposing. They never dwell on how good they were and how bad others could be. They move from plenitude to neutrality... 7. ♨️THEY BELIEVE IN THE UNITY AND CONNECTION OF ALL THINGS. For them, everything comes from a single Source and only one Spirit connects us all. Their perception of the world goes beyond borders, beyond skin colors, beyond borders. Their spirit is magnanimous that they feel connected even with the birds of the air and the fish of the sea... 8. ♨️THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THEIR OWN SKIN. Wherever you put an advanced soul, they tend to fit right in with their surroundings. They never lose their identity no matter where you place them. They do not feel a tinge of humiliation or idolatry. They are beings who know how to love themselves, therefore they love their entire environment... 9. ♨️THEY BELIEVE IN “WHAT IS”. For them, there is no positive or negative, they know that both are part of the same thing, and the unity of the whole is love! They are above the attraction of opposites because they live in non-duality. They exist both in totality and in nothingness. Your life is a continuous journey in all kingdoms or dimensions... 10. ♨️ THEY ARE NOT MATERIALISTS. They do not succumb to matter, they have everything but they do not need anything, they know that things are only short-term vehicles in matter. They also do not strive to accumulate or have things, they know that the Universe pays all its bills with great ABUNDANCE . That is why they will never lack anything, since they allow themselves to enjoy the 3rd Dimension but from the spirit... 11. ♨️THEY LOOK YOUNGER. The vicissitudes of life do not weigh them down. Their body feels lighter, they have fewer wrinkles and clearer skin... 12. ♨️THEY DON'T LIVE ON A TIMELINE. It is an absolute in the lifestyle of an advanced soul to live outside of time, they know that time does not exist, that is why they live outside of it.

Al-Fatehab Emergency Room Urgent statement Since the war began on April 15, the Sudanese people have endured the bitter consequences of violence, including killing, looting, displacement, rape, and destruction. Now, as we enter the seventh month of this war, the situation in various military operations areas across Sudan, and particularly in the Al-Fatehab area, has grown even more tragic. Al-Fatihab area is so far densely populated and has more than fifty thousand citizens as a preliminary estimate.. The sounds of battle have never ceased in this area, as it lies at the contact point between the regions controlled by the Army forces and the Rapid Support Militia. This ongoing conflict has taken a toll on various aspects of life and health, and the environmental conditions which have all worsened due to a blockade imposed by the Rapid Support Militia for more than three months restricting the entry of food and medical supplies. On the healthcare front, most hospitals and health centers have shut down, leaving only the hospital and centers supervised by the emergency room operational, however, these are now facing severe shortage of life-saving medications, chronic disease treatments, first-aid supplies, and laboratory materials. The medical staff is also under significant stress, having not received their salaries for over six months. In terms of living conditions, all markets except one (Um Dafso) have closed down. Essential commodities such as oil, flour, and sugar have ceased to exist and and obtaining them became an unattainable dream . Even basic food items like vegetables, meat, dairy, and their derivatives have vanished. On the environmental front, the situation has reached a catastrophic level due to the accumulation of household and medical waste. Ponds and stagnant water have become breeding grounds for flies, mosquitoes, and other disease-carrying vectors. Some cemeteries created as a result of the war have been exposed, with corpses swelling and dogs digging up graves. Regarding services, the Al-Muqrin water station has been offline for five months, and water trucks (Karo) are unable to enter due to a blockade. This has forced citizens to resort to drinking impure Nile water, resulting in an outbreak of watery diarrhea. As for electricity, over 60% of the Al-Fatihab area has no access to it, and the remaining 40% face unstable and fluctuating electrical supply. Due to the cumulative impact of these factors, Al-Fatihab area has become a disaster zone, with the looming threat of famine. This catastrophe could lead to a humanitarian crisis (truncated)",,343,"{'like_count': 79, 'comment_count': 44, 'num_users': 21811}",تنسيقية لجان مقاومة الفتيحاب,,2023-10-21 17:13:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/364799785_600799538899143_6129067218359458661_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=kIa_8DlbE1AAX9c6u9Z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDemmPBot-MbK_h6W4D8hzqUdWHjTT3uEByIPJGhqzFyg&oe=655BA25B,https://www.facebook.com/100069073052329/posts/641367644842332,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394268596_641368888175541_8177573815265996949_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=1xM6L_kCIroAX-Ub3N1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCT_DAuo77Xh-mLyA8aUeKjxyhcoL9U2O8JQr4XNQwkKg&oe=6538A06A
facebook,"What is the Two State Solution? You hear it all the time, but what does it actually mean and why is it not as simple as it sounds. Here's the background: Prior to 1967, the area known as the Gaza Strip was administered Egypt, and the area known as the West Bank was effectively part of Jordan. In 1967, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Iraq fought a war with Israel which resulted in an Israeli victory. The war was the third in a series of wars fought by Arab States with the objective of completely removing the Israeli State. At the end of the War, Israel seized the Gaza Strip and the entire Sinai peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. The Sinai peninsula was eventually given back to Egypt, however Egypt refused to take back the Gaza Strip. The Golan Heights and the West Bank have effectively remained under Israeli occupation ever since (Jordan eventually relinquished its claim to the West Bank in 1988). This means the West Bank has almost 2.8million Palestinians currently living under military occupation. When people talk about the ""Two State Solution"" they are pursuing the idea that the West Bank and Gaza Strip can become their own independent nation based on the borders before the war of 1967. This was the premise for the Oslo Accords and numerous peace plans ever since. So, what's the problem? There are two main obstacles. The first is the fact that Gaza is currently administered by a radical Islamist group who reject Israel's right to exist at all and, as we have seen recently, are unafraid to use terrorism to achieve their objectives. Hamas is a prescribed terrorist group in the US, UK, and Australia. Israel, understandably, don't see Hamas as someone they can negotiate with and don't want a State run by violent Jihadists, and funded by Iran, right next door. The West Bank, however, is administered by a more moderate group called Fatah who recognise Israel's right to exist and want a two state solution based on the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital. Reasonable? Yes. But not that simple. In the 50 odd years since the 1967 war, half a million Israelis have built almost 200 settlements scattered around the West Bank, and a further 200,000 Israeli's now live in East Jerusalem. Many of these settlements were illegal even by Israeli law, but they are fuelled in no small part by a belief held by many settlers that they have a God given right to the land as Jews. A belief supported by successive right wing Israeli Governments (like Netanyahu). So here is the impossible equation facing any Israeli Government. Any genuine two state solution would require the forced removal of about 700,000 of their own citizens, the majority of whom would not leave their homes without a fight. To be blunt, it would be a brave Israeli President to run for Office on a platform of kicking hundreds or thousands of Israelis out of their home. At this point, it would be great for me to offer a solution... but there's a good reason why this conflict has been so protracted for so long, there are no simple solutions. But hopefully this post helps you understand just how difficult any path to peace will be. Merely calling for a Two State Solution without offering a workaround for these obstacles really doesn't move us forward. As with all things in this war, things are complicated, and rarely black and white.",,342,"{'like_count': 157, 'comment_count': 85, 'num_users': 46540}",Carrick Ryan,,2023-10-21 03:02:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/290016231_588252616048356_52366744061228178_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bbldZ3w7478AX9y1hTN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD2a6rSjYKlHvWMDEWd7lAmBU-OWWcuP7i8onI83NYWaA&oe=655B6ADB,https://www.facebook.com/100045908673621/posts/883224969884451,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393351582_883224943217787_551148218837269514_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=v-oaRyJcQQwAX-Ka_qE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAtnS6U6AdgXmG_HE6mD_WlFQwNKST7B6VfwIMupzv_QQ&oe=6537BF9E
facebook,"Memorendum Submitted to H/CM N.Biren Singh by Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) Twitter : https://x.com/stdcm_org:=:https://twitter.com/stdcm_org Website: https://stdcm.org:=:https://stdcm.org/ To, Shri N. Biren Singh, Hon'ble Chief Minister, Manipur. Imphal, the 6th October, 2023 Sub: In the matter of the demand for inclusion of the ethnic Meitei/Meetei Community, one of the Indigenous Communities of Manipur, in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list under Article 342(1) of the Constitution of India. Hon'ble Sir, The present conflict in Manipur is now five months old with no immediate settlement in sight. The Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) had refrained from raising the voice for inclusion of the Meitei/Meetei community in the ST List during this period as it was felt that focus should be on bringing in normalcy in the State. STDCM had submitted a number of representations/memoranda on the matter highlighting the reasons for the demand for inclusion of the Meitei/Meetei community in the ST List along with the rationale. But unfortunately, till now even after the passage of more than a decade since the demand was first raised, the State Government has not initiated any steps towards this end where recommendation of the State Government is mandatory. The State Government had to just examine the five criteria and if the Meitei/Meetei community fulfils the same, positive recommendation shall be submitted to the Centre. And, it is for the Centre to examine the matter and finally a Bill is to be placed before the Parliament and after passing the bill, necessary notification to the effect has to be issued. The STDCM, as mentioned earlier refrained from moving the agenda during the first five months of the present conflict so as to enable the State Government to focus on bringing in normalcy in the State. But even after the passage of five months normalcy is till elusive, which is not surprising as the matter is quite complex. However, the STDCM has been compelled to submit this reminder as it is felt that granting of ST status to the Meitei/Meetei community can be one of the crucial aspects for the resolution of the present conflict. The STDCM is ever ready to negotiate with other existing ST communities to address their apprehensions, if any. Further, if timely action is not taken immediately, the Meitei/Meetei community may become the only indigenous community in the entire North-East of the country which is not provided with such constitutional safeguards as may be guaranteed to its indigenous communities. Without such Constitutional safeguards they will not be able to compete and survive with their heads held high in this competitive world. Your honour may be aware that there is already a Bill pending before the Rajya Sabha, namely The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill 2019 wherein five communities of Assam i.e., Chutiya, Matak, Moran, Koch Rajbongshi and Tai Ahom along with its 36 other communities are proposed to be included in the ST List(Copy enclosed for kind reference). Since the Bill is pending (since 9th January, 2019) with Rajya Sabha it does not lapse and it will be only a question of time that the Bill is cleared by both Houses of the Parliament and becomes a law of the land. Tai Ahom who are much more advanced in many respects than the Meitei/Meetei. Once the Bill is passed, the Meitei/Meetei will be the only indigenous community in the entire North-East which is not delared as ST and our claim for indigeneity may even be challenged on its constitutionality. The present time is critical for the Meitei/Meetei tribe and if positive step to include it in the ST List is not taken up urgently, the fate of the Meitei/Meetei tribe will hang on a thin thread and its survival just cannot be ensured, despite the fact that it has a 2000 year old history. Those in the helm of affairs now will be judged by their action either as a villain who assisted in destroying the Meitei/Meetei tribe or a saviour who ensured that the tribe continues to survive with its glory. Therefore, the STDCM on behalf of the Meitei/Meetei tribe once again beseech you kindly to initiate urgent necessary action and furnish the required recommendations along with the essential documents to the Government of India for inclusion of the Meitei/Meetei tribe in the Scheduled Tribe List under Article 342(1) of the Constitution of India so that the Bill regarding the Meitei/Meetei tribe can be placed before Parliament and discussed and passed along with the afore-mentioned pending Bill. We look forward to your kind positive action on this matter. Enclosed: As above Yours faithfully, 1. Dhiraj Yumnam President 2. K. Bhogendrajit Singh General Secretary #STDCM #Meitei #Meetie #ScheduledTribes #Manipur #MeiteiTribe #MeeteiTribe",,342,"{'like_count': 268, 'comment_count': 41, 'num_users': 240042}",Manipur Times,,2023-10-21 10:26:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/309255395_155285533797517_5732676017831177933_n.png?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6tK4gQun53kAX9HR7MR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDrHGeeb_shnua7bHpQfJemiZIrHCYmQJbA7vhxNRVBhQ&oe=655B1D7E,https://www.facebook.com/100079482126837/posts/313532461306156,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394373095_313532371306165_3830137046238388838_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=JhLMcpmZ_e4AX9MXC36&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDbbD9GaCugn82dgix9oEOz6QRi3Uv1uIZWidXQN9M9OA&oe=6538F6AA

facebook,"FORTIFIED TOWN POČITELJ / 1926.year 𒁓 Počitelj, a mesmerizing fortified town in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has long been a source of fascination for scholars and adventurers alike, with its hidden secrets and intriguing history. **The Enigmatic Name** 𒋝 The story begins with the quest to decipher the very essence of ""Počitelj."" Its etymology remains a captivating puzzle, with multiple theories adding layers to the mystery. 𒋝 Some suggest its roots in the verb ""počivati,"" an invitation to rest. Others propose that the town's castellan, a guardian of secrets, bestowed this name. 𒋝 A theory whispers that it harks back to a time when learned individuals ""honored lords,"" giving rise to the name ""Počitelj."" 𒋝 In the tapestry of possibilities, one thread weaves it to the Italian word ""cittadela,"" denoting a fortified town, while another connects it to the verb ""čitati,"" beckoning us to read between the lines. 𒋝 The name of Počitelj remains a captivating secret, destined to continue its spell on both the public and scholars. **A Medieval Guardian** 𒋝 Venturing deeper into the tale, we encounter a medieval fortress nestled along the left bank of the Neretva River, near Čapljina. This fortress, like a steadfast sentinel, guarded the entrance to the lower Neretva valley, keeping watch over travelers along the path from Drijeva to Bišće. 𒋝 The earliest mention of Počitelj graced a 1444 charter, where it was known as ""Posichell."" In the annals of history, it reappeared in 1448 as ""castrum Beczitel"" and in 1454 as ""civitate Pozitell cum pertinentiis suis."" 𒋝 Yet, for a considerable stretch of time, a misconceived belief held sway. It was believed that Počitelj was the site of a Bosnian royal shipyard during the 14th century. However, the truth, like a buried treasure, lay elsewhere. 𒋝 The renowned coastal city founded by Tvrtko I. Kotromanić in 1383 was called Brštanik. This misunderstanding, akin to a phantom ship, linked shipbuilding to Počitelj due to its location. But the truth, much like the dawn dispelling the night, revealed that Brštanik was located farther away, severing the imaginary connection. 𒋝 Nevertheless, the pages of some literature continue to hold this erroneous belief. They claim that Tvrtko constructed Počitelj in 1383, a town shrouded in shipbuilding myths. **A Key Player in Ottoman Conflict** 𒋝 The history of Počitelj also tells the tale of its pivotal role in the conflict with the Ottomans. **A Modern Renaissance** 𒋝 In more recent times, this Herzegovinian town along the picturesque banks of the Neretva River experienced a renaissance, reminiscent of a phoenix rising from the ashes. From the latter half of the 16th century, it underwent substantial development. This transformation was a harmonious blend of architectural traditions, merging the oriental and Mediterranean influences. 𒋝 To this very day, Počitelj continues to preserve its architectural and cultural treasures.

1st Reading: Isaiah 45:1, 4–6

Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue  nations before him and  to loose the belts of kings, to open doors before him that gates may not be closed: For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I name you, though you do not know me. I am the Lord, and there is no other, besides me there is no God; I equip you, though you do not know me, that people may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is none besides me; I am the Lord, and there is no other.

Psalm 96:1 and 3, 4–5,7–8, 9–10a, and c 
Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

O sing a new song to the Lord; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Tell among the nations his glory, and his wonders among all the peoples. 

Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

For the Lord is great and highly to be praised, to be feared above all gods. For the gods of the nations are naught. It was the Lord who made the heavens. 

Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

Give the Lord, you families of peoples, give the Lord glory and power; give the Lord the glory of his name.   Bring an offering and enter his courts. 

Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

Worship the Lord in holy splendour. O tremble before him, all the earth. Say to the nations, “The Lord is king.” he will judge the peoples in fairness. 

Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

2nd Reading: 1 Thessalonians 1:1–5b
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labour of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction.

Acclamation: You shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life.

Gospel: Matthew 22:15–21
At that time: The Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle Jesus in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone’s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
 
Reflection: Although the Pharisees are primarily a religious group, they are also political nationalists who resent paying taxes to the emperor and oppose all attempts by the Romans to interfere with the Jewish way of life. The Herodians, on the other hand, are a political group who support Herod Antipas and the Romans, and are open to making changes ordered by the Romans. These opposing camps, setting aside their ideological differences, conspire to discredit Jesus and if possible to eliminate Him, their common enemy. The different Christian communities today, divided on the basis of language, caste, race, beliefs and rites, can draw positive lessons from this. Since all Christians are united by the common thread of faith in Christ, they should strive, albeit their differences, to foster unity and cooperation among themselves because, as Pope Francis exhorts, “Unity is always higher than conflict.”

facebook,"As the conflict between Israel and Hamas Rages on in the Middle East, around the world, false anti-Israel narratives are beginning to appear, just as we predicted they would. The most recent of these narratives involves a hospital that was allegedly bombed by Israel, however it was later revealed to have been a misfire by the jihadists themselves. News outlets like the The New York Times ran with this fake narrative only issuing a correction after the damage had already been done. The ACLJ is now waged in a war for truth, a war that will determine public opinion about Israel for years to come.

facebook,"A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in the midst of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, and once more health workers face dire challenges. Even before Tuesday’s massive explosion at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital—which resulted in hundreds of deaths according to the Gaza Health Ministry—the World Health Organization last week described the health system in Gaza as “at a breaking point,” and reported: “Hospitals have only a few hours of electricity each day as they are forced to ration depleting fuel reserves and rely on generators to sustain the most critical functions. Even these functions will have to cease in a few days when fuel stocks are due to run out. The impact would be devastating for the most vulnerable patients, including the injured who need lifesaving surgery, patients in intensive care units, and newborns depending on care in incubators.” Marianne Szegedy-Maszak reached out to author Leonard Rubenstein for help in contextualizing what is happening in Gaza, with special attention to hospitals and health workers.

facebook,"Understanding the power of Love. One day my teacher told me of an incident that had happened in the monastery. An English woman, a friend of his, had arrived and was immediately angry with him, standing in front of him shouting and waving her arms. I was shocked to hear this, for in my mind I could not understand how anyone could be angry at this beautiful, smiling, brown skinned man, so I asked the question, “Bhante, what did you do?” “Oh,” he said, “I just waited for the anger to pass, then my friend was back.” This is the power of love. Without understanding, perhaps this story shows that when we are weak, we will accept the anger and abuse from others? With true understanding we will see that it is the absolute power of love that allows us to be in difficult situations in life and not take them personally and equally importantly, not be drawn into the madness of the world and react, like with like. When there is no wisdom and no love this is how the world manifests. Anger leading to more anger, fighting leading to more fighting, killing leading to more killing. Hatred is never overcome by more hatred. Only love overcomes hatred, This is an eternal law. Dhammapada: verse 5 It is only when we are out of balance that we allow ourselves to be abused and drawn into conflict. Choosing, taking sides, arguing who is right and who is wrong, always seeking blame and humiliation of the other. Love exists beyond this level of mind and is the only true and real balance in our life. It is love that will bring peace to ourselves and the world, but this practice of Loving Kindness (Metta Bhavana) is rarely fully understood. People have told me that their style of Loving Kindness is different from mine and that they take all the people that they don’t like and wrap them in pink fluffy clouds, “but you know,” they say, “they’re still as horrible as ever!” Here is the truth we must understand: We don’t practice Loving Kindness to change the other. We practice Loving Kindness so that we can be with the other - however they are! This is our strength, not to continually insist that the world and everything in it is always the way we think it should be so that we can be happy. Vipassana and Loving Kindness is a very mature way of life and living, it says ‘I accept you as you are and make no demands that you should be different so that I can be happy.’ Love is the real and beautiful power in our life. It is never weak and never subservient. It manifests in every moment as complete and unconditional acceptance of the universe exactly as it is in this moment. Things are like this, that is the reality of this moment, now, what is our place in this? With awareness we see, with love we accept, with wisdom we respond. This is the whole of Dhamma. May all beings be happy.",,282,"{'like_count': 132, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 378496}","Buddhism, Zen, Tao & Meditation",,2023-10-21 04:00:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/108210710_742860549849290_1607692417026481477_n.jpg?stp=c23.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=wZfkcwhHrRwAX_uSXCR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBwHd9FifkrjEybSXPuwKvzX3CNipuBkPH5IN2wJ_llYw&oe=657D4C8F,https://www.facebook.com/groups/201160854608282/permalink/871786494212378,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391576437_10159449248736156_2548337280378953966_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=lDBNLVJeWlkAX_UXTY1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMn-Fzit1oOxSbt3TGhD2nUd4u139au8fGGuMVC9N01Q&oe=6537F47B

facebook,"My 1st date with Star was almost the last. Why? Because I didn’t communicate. I liked her…a lot. But I didn’t tell her. I was almost silent. We both left the night frustrated. Me, because I didn’t “show up” and talk with her. And for Star, she thought it was a waste of time because she didn’t think I liked her. This wasn’t true, but she was forced to make an assumption based on my silence. Carline Leaf said, “What isn’t communicated is felt. What is felt is often interpreted. And what is interpreted is often inaccurate.” A great marriage needs mutual sacrificial love. But without effective communication, that love will be muted. The ceiling of your relationship is not determined by your level of love for each other but rather by your ability to connect, resolve conflict, and have fun together through communication. If you want a great marriage, become great at communication. . . . #communication #communicationtips #communicationskills #marriagerevolution #marriage",,277,"{'like_count': 161, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 36502}",Marriage Revolution,,2023-10-21 23:00:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312483289_542904561179974_2669711524998037364_n.jpg?stp=c155.155.770.770a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4BfV8eHKpDMAX-F3hLk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBDtBIM8PLdUied7s6KodDUnF6l1sjEPCtMVlaDFbnnEw&oe=655B6237,https://www.facebook.com/100063813043316/posts/808040661333028,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/395020100_808040637999697_7858817942314397542_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y6T6ag1lUOEAX94ELsq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDm_sVKHota76QPlQ7o15sVRzKXagxv8PI-2nIiQNPm0A&oe=655A2FB8

facebook,"""Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.” 1 Corinthians 15:58 There is no way around this fact that in this life we will have trials. We will have struggles but they are to grow us and to stretch our faith. So we step out in faith; and even then, we can have times of fear, doubt and anxiety. Many times we avoid conflict, hide from our struggles or simply try to escape pain through various ways. We can try and ignore our pressures but sooner or later avoidance won't work anymore. We have to face the situation we find ourselves in. The good news is that God is faithful. He knows our struggles, He knows our limitations. The Apostle Paul encourages us, because of the love and power of God, to stand firm and let nothing move us. So, my brothers and sisters in Christ, no matter what life throws at us, we must stand firm. We must not let anything move us. May it be personal problems, may it physical problems, financial problems or a myriad of other things. We are to trust God, and not be moved. We should let God handle our situation, and believe that He will always be there for us. And You cry out to Him and decide to Exercise your faith and give all your struggles, trials and temptations to Him and you feel your burden become lighter. You sense that God is giving you strength to live for Him. You affirm, ""I will trust in God I will stand firm and let nothing move me and I will give myself fully to Your work!""",,254,"{'like_count': 91, 'comment_count': 35, 'num_users': 127671}",Daily Devotional,,2023-10-21 07:15:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/64260721_10156104175222155_5864919490709422080_n.jpg?stp=c0.2.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=gz661-WgzhkAX_SsnId&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBiwjjXpyYAkJh97tesSbHKiCwkPdb_0-jXkXDKffXGjw&oe=657D2E6C,https://www.facebook.com/groups/104588193075626/permalink/2339392482928508,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394199142_10159338957437155_6449075298847307131_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Owiy6CVrGQcAX_Mb-q0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDfUJPdEyidnIOH3nqiQDOdecdVD8-VDDcUDIm71p7Y4Q&oe=6538884D

Tech giants like IBM, Accenture, Google, and major firms like Walmart and Bank of America are leading this shift. (https://tinyurl.com/4w7j6bv6:=:https://www.foxnews.com/media/us-companies-eliminate-college-degrees-requirement-school-costs) Is the same transformation underway here? The data is scarce. We know that high education costs have put degrees out of reach for many. There's a growing skills gap between what colleges teach and what employers need. Technology has also altered the landscape, with many skills better built through on-the-job training. As one expert said, you can get hired if you grasp the role, want it, and can do it - demonstrate the knowledge and zeal. This simple way spots potential better than parsing academic records. Myriad vital skills cannot be learned in school. Skills like bridging generational divides, maintaining mental health amid fraught relationships, and constantly upskilling as technology advances. Remote work has birthed communication and collaboration challenges. Increasing workplace diversity ratchets up the pressure to sustain productivity and harmony. Hybrid models complicate management. Conflict resolution is now daily fare, not part of sporadic crisis management. Our educational system, hobbled by politics and corruption, lacks coherent policy responses to this emerging landscape. Funneling more funds into minting college grads won't cut it. We shouldn’t feed the diploma mills. We may need to overhaul the entire apparatus. In the transition, the last things we need are ROTC and red-tagging. On all fronts, we must strip away curricular excess and sharply focus on writing, research, analysis, and critical thinking — the fundamentals of a robust mind. Concurrently, we must hone the real-world skills employers desire - technical chops, communication, teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving. 𝘒𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘢𝘯 𝘴𝘢𝘣𝘢𝘺-𝘴𝘢𝘣𝘢𝘺. AI can accelerate learning curves. Online platforms are supplanting schools. Digital boot camps and technical certificates can secure jobs quicker than degrees. Practical, affordable alternatives to classroom learning abound. We must propagate a ""vertical expertise, horizontal flexibility"" model to catapult Filipino workers into the 21st century, degree or no degree. But we can't do this while squandering time revising historical facts in our textbooks. Policymakers must also ensure job stability, fair pay, and advancement for non-degreed workers. Regulations are needed to prevent exploitation and abuse. We must foster diverse, eclectic workplaces. As jobs morph rapidly, lifelong learning and adaptation will be crucial. We must retire healthy, not burnt out. Some may call this wishful thinking in a country wrestling with a 3 percent poverty learning rate and struggling to provide children with sufficient nutrients to survive. But alongside addressing those dire needs, we must transform our educational ecosystem for our nation's future. The path ahead will not be easy. Entrenched interests profit from preserving the status quo. Corrupt leaders want ignorant constituents. But we cannot let inertia forestall progress. Equipping youth with skills for available jobs and cultivating lifelong learning must become national priorities. With compassionate guidance, those without degrees can blossom into top performers. Given opportunities to prove themselves, they will repay trust manifold. An open mind is the raw material for success, not a diploma. This transition will require significant public and private investment in training programs. But the returns will be immense - a workforce with skills aligned to available jobs — a nation of strength and relevance in a competitive world. The path will be bumpy. But pioneering firms have illuminated the way forward.

It's their way of feeling loved and valued. During Conflict or Stress: Stay Calm: Maintain a calm and composed tone during conflicts. Reiterate your love for them and emphasize that the relationship matters. Active Listening: Listen attentively to their concerns. Reflect on what they say to show you understand their feelings.

facebook,"It’s been a very somber last week in parliament. It’s not just the suffering and dying in war zones that sickens and terrifies me, it’s what is born there. Seeds are sown for more conflict, more cruelty, more suffering, for generations to come. I felt this strongly when I visited the battlefields of World War 1. A lingering sense of evil - the only time in my life I’d use this word as a best description. Seems we never learn the lessons of history. If you are a 16 year old in #gaza you have now seen 6 wars in your short life. That’s desperately sad, and a warning to us all about how intractable this conflict has become. A conflict that could not only draw in other middle eastern powers (as has been the case 5 times over the past 65 years) but risks becoming global. The Greens are a party of peace and non violence, that’s one big reason I joined them. We condemn all violence, especially against civilians in wars. There has to be a better way forward to end the seemingly endless impasse of violence, occupation, suffering, war crimes - rather than the expected wholesale destruction of a city that has millions of occupants, 40% of them children. Binary ‘with us or against us’ political messaging is offensive and should be rejected, and makes more bloodshed inevitable, today and into the future. I’ll continue to share important updates from the @unitednations and other trusted information sources on this unfolding human catastrophe in and around Gaza, and what you can do. As much as it’s understandable- human nature to turn away when it all becomes too much for us to see, bear, we simply can’t. There is way too much at stake, we need to call for a ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and peace talks that offer hope for long term resolutions. #palestine #israel",,230,"{'like_count': 94, 'comment_count': 38, 'num_users': 32140}",Senator Peter Whish-Wilson,,2023-10-21 00:02:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/273920965_504466064382962_7711004552295654763_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=RnlWJT0zuIEAX_Z1gy8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBLEZZ0bdiiLS1XFJRJOBfvcrEGCcHxw2u5n1kzYZ2Srg&oe=6559F0C7,https://www.facebook.com/100044587172682/posts/882344843261747,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391640497_882344806595084_7620602083195938904_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=p70yTtq0wVQAX8aC7M_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDfNG_9n8aU6yhfiFkriEvdTutPMf3K4eNLSjrhkp3ezg&oe=6559816E

YAB PM turut menyatakan cabaran geopolitik masa kini memerlukan kerjasama erat dalam bidang ekonomi di antara ASEAN dan GCC dalam memastikan potensi ekonomi di antara dua rantau dapat dipenuhi. Malaysia menyatakan kesediaan bagi transformasi ini. Bagi memudahcara perkara ini, Malaysia mencadangkan pembentukan Perjanjian Kerjasama Ekonomi Menyeluruh ASEAN-GCC (ASEAN-GCC Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement - CEPA). Perjanjian penting ini dapat menggalakkan pembangunan yang progresif, inklusif dan mampan, terutamanya dalam rangka pemulihan pasca-COVID-19 dan ketidaktentuan geopolitik.

The key outcome of the Summit includes the Joint Statement of ASEAN-GCC and the ASEAN-GCC Framework of Cooperation (FOC) for 2024-2028. YAB PM in his statement expressed Malaysia’s grave concern on the ongoing crisis of Palestine-Israel. Malaysia commended the leadership of the GCC in addressing the situation in Gaza and also stressed the importance of collaboration with the GCC to address the urgent humanitarian needs and alleviate the suffering of the people in Gaza. YAB PM stated that the current geopolitical challenges compel a reimagining of economic cooperation between ASEAN and the GCC to harness the economic potential of both regions. Malaysia is dedicated to this transformation. To facilitate this, Malaysia proposes the creation of an ASEAN-GCC Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). This agreement is deemed essential for promoting progressive, inclusive, and sustainable growth, particularly in the context of post-COVID-19 recovery and geopolitical uncertainties. Notably, this CEPA would be the first-ever Free Trade Agreement between ASEAN and the Middle East. Malaysia, as the Country Coordinator for ASEAN-GCC cooperation in 2023 is indeed honoured to be part of this historical event and having played a role in facilitating the convening of the first Summit between ASEAN and GCC.

facebook,"👑 On this day - 21st October 1422 👑 . 👑 Death of Charles VI, the mad King of France 👑 . 👑 Any king who starts out as Charles the Beloved and ends up as Charles the Mad had something go seriously wrong along the way. Charles VI inherited one of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe, but as his mind grew more and more unhinged, his reign grew darker and darker, until he very nearly wiped France off the map.... 👑 Charles VI was born on 3rd December 1368, the son of King Charles V of the house of Valois, and his wife Joanna of Bourbon. His elder brothers died before he was born, so Charles was heir to the French throne, and held the title Dauphin of France. 👑 Charles ascended the throne at the young age of eleven, his father left behind a favorable military situation, marked by the reconquest of most of the English possessions in France. Charles had several uncles, powerful dukes, who were to rule in his stead, as his regents. Charles VI would rule France during a time of great chaos, and that turmoil existed within him as well. His reign was marked by the continuing conflict with the English, known as the Hundred years War. 👑 While Charles’s uncles were busy running France into the ground, Charles grew into a young man. By 17, he was fit, attractive, and athletic. Isabeau of Bavaria, was selected as his Bride. Isabeau was no fragile princess. She was quick-witted and intelligent, and she absorbed her lessons on the French court with ease. Pretty soon, she had all new clothes in the French style, she knew the ins and outs of French etiquette, and she was ready to meet her soon-to-be husband. 👑 Charles fell head over heels for Isabeau, the woman his advisors had selected for him was beautiful, young, and brilliant. From there, their romance was a whirlwind, he married Isabeau just three days after their first meeting. Though Isabeau of Bavaria would soon learn that the ring on her finger was more like an anchor, her marriage couldn't have gotten off to a better start. Charles was absolutely obsessed with her, and he lavished her with expensive gifts. They were a young couple in love, and they made the most of it—but it couldn't last forever. Though Charles's uncles still ruled France in his stead, he wasn't a boy any longer. 👑 It was time for Charles to take the reins and become the king he was meant to be—for better or for worse. When he was 21, he terminated the regency and took over the kingdom himself. Early in his reign, Charles's people dubbed him ""Charles the Beloved"" for getting rid of his greedy uncles and bringing stability back to France. After his early successes, those around Charles the beloved started to notice something was...changing about him. 👑 As the years went by, the people who had once called him Charles the Beloved started whispering another name: Charles the Mad. His mental illness came and went, so that you could never quite tell what kind of king you were going to get. His first bout of madness started in 1392, after assailants attacked his close friend and advisor, Olivier de Clisson. 👑 Charles started to grow paranoid, but no one expected just how twisted his mind would become. He constantly started suffering from fever and convulsions. Charles would live out the rest of his life plagued by insanity, and his kingly power was held by his influential uncles, and his wife Queen Isabeau of Bavaria. 👑 His paranoia and violent rages made him dangerous and homicidal to anyone in his close proximity. He infamously began running wildly through the hallways of his Parisian palace, in various states of dress/undress. At a certain point, his advisors had to wall up the entrances to the palace, lest the king run straight out into the streets. 👑 During one episode in 1393, he could not remember his name, and did not know he was king. When his wife came to visit, he asked his servants who she was and ordered them to take care of what she required, so that she would leave him alone. His spells of madness often meant Charles had to be restrained. 👑 Now, this was the Middle Ages, so it's not like everyone was walking around smelling like roses, but Charles took ""lack of hygiene"" to a whole new level. Once, he refused to bathe, or even change his clothes—for five whole months. The King of France was wearing soiled, disheveled robes, stinking to high heaven! So bad was his personal hygiene, it got to the point that he had to be cut out of his clothes. 👑 For the next three decades of Charles life, he would suffer similar mental breakdowns that would take him out of normality, for months at a time. Pretty soon, it began to take a toll on his wife. The first few years of Charles and Isabeau's relationship were mostly wonderful. They were madly in love, and they welcomed three children—though it wasn't all marital bliss. She lost two children in infancy, but at least she had her beloved husband to comfort her. However, as the madness began to creep in, Charles grew increasingly (truncated)",,227,"{'like_count': 188, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 256768}",The Tudor Intruders -and more,,2023-10-21 08:23:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311444111_622558726180551_8988112264261620694_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=B3_NV5ZhIRYAX-QmmWO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBKYD1woC_ZTwsiBTvB2H53DWmpdzoOCXU5u5RidsqgXw&oe=6559F4C5,https://www.facebook.com/100052792866330/posts/847430580360030,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394477477_847430547026700_45933309208375988_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yVfFskG0lzUAX-USXXm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDskgwdGk_FLgEwD0PCq6MjMiiVC969ZT4L6ji6btDe0g&oe=65392244
facebook,"Won prestigious award🏆 - thanked his wife and joked about wedding nerves. #Jakob_Ingebrigtsen 🇳🇴 was honored🏆🥳 on Saturday evening for his exceptional season. The Sandnes boy set two world records💥💥, took WC gold🥇, WC silver🥈 and a double 💎Diamond League triumph🥇🥇. A year ago, the 23-year-old shared the award with Sweden's #Armand_Duplantis🇸🇪, but this season there was only one winner. In the Lithuanian🇱🇹 capital Vilnius, the Norwegian🇳🇴 was called up on stage, in favor of #Duplantis🇸🇪 and the Greek long jumper #Miltiadis_Tedoglou🇬🇷 - I'm in my own bubble and mostly focused on my own everyday life, and the competitions that take place on the athletics track, but to have an evening where you celebrate #European_Athletics and I'm awarded this prize, that's great, he says to NRK with award in hand. - It is well deserved, and as he also says, it is very nice to receive recognition for what you do. It is very large, praises his wife 💍Elisabeth. It didn't really come as a bombshell. Because there has been a hail of records from Ingebrigtsen in 2023: ✅ World record in 2000 meters ✅ World record for two English miles ✅ European record in 1500 meters ✅ European record for one English mile ✅ European record in 3000 meters ◾️He took European Championship gold🥇🥇 indoors in the 1500 meters and 3000 meters in March. ◾️It was silver🥈 in the 1500 meters and gold🥇 in the 5000 meters during the WC in Budapest. ◾️The season ended with a double win in the 💎Diamond League final. There he won both the 🥇English mile and the 🥇3000 meters in Eugene. During the award ceremony, he singled out the WC gold🥇 as the highlight🎊💫, and afterwards the star admitted that he is the type who quickly ""forgets"". - That's why things like this are nice to be ""forced"" to take part in, because I'm a bit like that, I move on to the next very quickly and put competitions and achievements behind me. Whether it's good or bad. From time to time it can be good to take a break and have fun with the people you travel with, says Ingebrigtsen. 🔶 Got questions about the wedding💍👰🏼‍♀️🤵🏻 On top of the medal and record sprinkling, he married #Elisabeth_Asserson in September. The jury hardly emphasized the marriage in the assessments, but Ingebrigtsen has stated several times how important she is to his career as a runner. In his acceptance speech, he also mentioned his ""beautiful wife Elisabeth"" - I want to share this with #Elisabeth, #Henrik and #Filip. But it is clear that I have many people around, with physiotherapists, friends and family who travel around and cheer and help me in my daily work, he says to NRK. - What is more nerve-wracking: standing on the starting line in the WC or getting married? asked the award presenter on stage. - The wedding speech, he replied laughing. 📹 NRK interview in norwegian: https://www.nrk.no/video/16a9fb18-fc5b-4511-880c-c42971d5411d:=:https://www.nrk.no/video/jakob-ingebrigtsen-om-aa-vaere-gift--naa-er-du-forpliktet_16a9fb18-fc5b-4511-880c-c42971d5411d 🔶Turbulent season. #Jakob_Ingebrigtsen's🇳🇴 season has not only been about running. The inflamed conflict with his father and former coach, #Gjert_Ingebrigtsen, has increasingly received attention. This week, #Jakob, together with his brothers #Henrik and #Filip, published an article in VG in which they claimed to have been exposed to physical violence and threats growing up. Gjert Ingebrigtsen denies it. The three brothers do not want to answer questions about the conflict. They have asked for calm. 🔶Norwegian successful season on the track.💥🔥⭐️ Norway🇳🇴 has never delivered a better season on the pitch. #Jakob_Ingebrigtsen led a series of brilliant achievements. #Karsten_Warholm🇳🇴 took WC gold🥇 in the 400 meter hurdles and delivered three of the five best races of his career. #Narve_Gilje_Nordås🇳🇴 impressed with bronze🥉 in the 1,500 meters at the World Championships - and a number of strong performances. The progress of 21-year-old #Håvard_Bentdal_Ingvaldsen🇳🇴 was among the biggest surprises. The 400-metre runner from Moelv was also nominated in the category ""Star of the Year"". #Ingvaldsen came close to setting a European record in the attempt and came sixth in the WC final. He also lowered #Warholm's Norwegian record from 44.87 to 44.39 seconds. The Norwegian was in the hall, but the award went to the Italian long jumper, #Mattia_Furlani🇮🇹. The award for #European_athlete_of_the_year ⭐️ has now been awarded to Norwegians six times. #Trine_Hattestad🇳🇴 and #Andreas_Thorkildsen🇳🇴 won for their achievements in the javelin throw in 2000 and 2008 respectively. #Karsten_Warholm🇳🇴 won in 2019 and 2021, while #Jakob_Ingebrigtsen🇳🇴 shared the prize with #Duplantis🇸🇪 last year.

Funny enough, I tried sparking up arguments whenever she visited, complained bitterly about anything she did but it didn't work She would either tell me ""I'm sorry my love, you know I didn't mean to offend you"" and smile that her irresistible smile and before I realise, I would be smiling myself... Or she would look at me with her baby face until I apologize. She never shouted back or spoke rudely...until one day, I made the mistake of asking her why she never picked a quarrel ""You never shout or speak back at me, you're always too cool...I don't know if you will even be able to handle conflict in marriage sef..."" I complained She looked at me, shocked and surprised at the same time... ""So you want us to be quarreling?"" She asked ""No, but...you know, arguments bring better understanding in relationships"" I explained bluntly ""You think I don't understand you enough?"" She asked, still calm By then I realised I was just being stupid...I kept mute ""No problem, you've asked for it"" she said Gbam. I started apologizing immediately but she gave deaf ears...a part of still wanted the drama to happen so I left her alone after pleading for some time I left for my room and waited for her to come and meet me but she stayed in the living room for almost an hour...

facebook,"Ladies and gentlemen, We gather here today to address a topic that has plagued humanity for centuries: war. It's a subject that has brought pain, suffering, and division to countless communities around the world. But it's also a subject that we must actively work to change. We must collectively advocate for peace and strive to stop wars. War is a destructive force that tears at the very fabric of our society. It takes lives, destroys homes, and leaves behind a trail of heartache. It sows the seeds of hatred and revenge, perpetuating a cycle of violence that seems never-ending. However, the resolve to stop wars lies within our hands. First and foremost, we must acknowledge the power of diplomacy. History has shown us that peaceful negotiations, dialogue, and compromise can avert conflicts and bring about resolutions that benefit all parties involved. We must invest in diplomacy and engage in open, honest, and empathetic conversations with nations and people of different backgrounds. Secondly, we must address the root causes of conflict. Often, wars erupt due to a complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors. Poverty, inequality, and discrimination can create fertile ground for conflict. By working to alleviate these issues, we can reduce the likelihood of war. Moreover, education is a powerful tool in preventing wars. When we educate ourselves and our future generations about the horrors of war and the value of peace, we can foster a culture of tolerance, understanding, and compassion. It is our responsibility to teach the next generation that war is not the answer. In an age of increasing globalization, we must also recognize our interdependence. What happens in one part of the world can have far-reaching consequences elsewhere. Therefore, we must actively promote international cooperation and emphasize the importance of unity in the face of global challenges. Let us remember the wise words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."" To stop wars, we must replace hatred with love, violence with peace, and division with unity. In conclusion, stopping wars is not an impossible dream. It is a noble pursuit that requires the dedication and collective effort of all nations and individuals. Together, we can create a world where conflict is resolved through dialogue, compassion, and understanding. Let us work tirelessly to make ""peace"" more than just a word, but a reality for all. Thank you.",,215,"{'like_count': 147, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 36660}",Sandra Bullock forever,,2023-10-21 16:48:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/350642324_127653137000378_6474256326745485635_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_aid=0&_nc_ohc=bxYC-mCxusMAX-TFlGJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBrFTILrXPi_QxP6-pt4C-ecz-xQ--0enWmiJVQDx4O2Q&oe=655B74D1,https://www.facebook.com/100092353699996/posts/239589502462838,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/395056306_239589472462841_7196791689664380978_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jzeVHn9BYuYAX_KjDXK&_nc_oc=AQl8U6IKDlx-RXKD7EUs1VDNMQYQjlZ60qLGkxsCwwZgtNW-awVLj6f6iqr_Gb2I4uk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCmxU8iyZxv5EkhWOfmXRUMVAiR92gbAuvGfmDP39gTEw&oe=6538640D
facebook,"Loch Leven Castle. Kinross. The earliest Castle to have been built on Castle Island Loch Leven is thought to date to about 1257 during the rein of Alexander III, at this point the castle would only have consisted of just the Curtain Wall, Parts of this early phase can still be seen. The castle has seen much action over its lifetime, It was taken by Edward I during the 1st Scottish Wars of Independence, and then latter during the same conflict, possibly by William Wallace before 1300. Edward I’s men initiated another siege but this time it was crushed by John (The Red) Comyn. After the death of King Robert Bruce the forces of Edward Balliol attempted to retake the Scottish Crown in the 2nd Scottish Wars of Independence, again Loch Leven Castle became a main target due to its location between Edinburgh, Perth and Stirling. During this siege Balliol’s forces attempted to flood the Castle by placing a dam over the Loch’s outlet, over the course of a month the water level rose, but a night raid by Scottish forces destroyed the dam and flooded Balliol’s camp instead. By the late 14th century the Tower House was added and is now one of the earliest substantially surviving Tower Houses in Scotland. Mary Queen of Scots was brought here after her defeat at the Battle of Carberry Hill 1567, Queen Mary was forced to submit to the opposing Lords rather than start a Civil War, she was also forced to Abdicate in favour of her 1 year old Son James VI. About a year into her imprisonment Mary managed to escape with the Help of George Douglas the Castle Keeper. Soon after these events a new house was built on the near by shore, this new build was appropriately called Newhouse, this became the main residence for the castle keepers and the old Castle began to loose its importance, by the end of the 16th century the Castle was falling into disrepair. It has been suggested that the loch here was originally called Loch Lomond as it is backed by the Lomond Hills and that Loch Lomond was once called Loch Leven as the River Leven flows from the south of Lomond through the Vale of Leven. #scotland #historicscotland #kinrossshire #lochlevencastle",,215,"{'like_count': 184, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 25541}",ScenicScotland,,2023-10-21 06:27:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/132422645_231553721707764_3546262233124519273_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=4_44fbNjM-8AX8OOQ71&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCaA-xBjDlOAnB4uMdQT1rMAm7WaRsIljIVNcT0zjqhbQ&oe=657D37AB,https://www.facebook.com/100045594139817/posts/861557652040698,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394607060_861557588707371_1102234107920411880_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2B-giyWbyxYAX9dU3NU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBRO7LgFsCL2bWxn0wDP31sUfnK-ffvHPf8evTCuBZHsg&oe=6538E933

facebook,"Palestinians throw stones at Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron following a rally in solidarity with Gaza as war rages between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel continued to pummel the Gaza Strip overnight with airstrikes, amid warnings that Israeli forces could invade the Hamas-ruled territory at any time. The Israel Defense Forces posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: “During the night, fighter jets attacked over a hundred operational targets of the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, destroying tunnel shafts, munitions warehouses and dozens of operational headquarters.” Meanwhile, Israel is planning to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona. Authorities said Friday that the town’s residents will be placed in state-funded guest houses. The northern city is located near Israel’s border with Lebanon and has been subjected to numerous rocket and missile attacks from Palestinian militant groups. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak travels Friday to Egypt, his latest Middle Eastern destination, as the conflict continues to grow. Sunak has already met with Israeli leaders and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. https://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-convoy-into-gaza-delayed/7319008.html",,214,"{'like_count': 122, 'comment_count': 55, 'num_users': 13090753}",Voice of America,,2023-10-21 04:00:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352992991_178766095145684_5027481947854717491_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=18ZZdScV7x8AX_v3UtK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA-0oRGDfzOgJKAktJbxD6u7JzyNcJUAbbN0bpHjZ8-Q&oe=655A6AC2,https://www.facebook.com/100064458353336/posts/715981490560456,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393278195_1040480490313770_7428860387682768196_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=TUgHHrI4dJgAX-4Lbn4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC5Z10Ut6yD4WNZbXTrkKOJxUPKKy4bHQ8evSNUKcV67g&oe=6538FAA5
facebook,"James Webster Davidson (1895-1987), was born and raised in Gatehouse of Fleet. Living in Canada when war broke out in 1914, he returned to Gatehouse at the end of the conflict where he earned a living as a salmon fisherman (pictured). Like many young men of the time, Jim enjoyed writing verse and in 1920 he committed to paper a number of his poems, of which this is one: The Courtin’ Nicht When the courtin’ nicht comes roon yince mair It aye seems tae be my fate The boss comes in wi extra work He’s shair tae keep me late I git squared up, a’ things laid by Then aff I toddle hame The streets are like a skating rink When late, it’s aye the same I tried tae rin’ bit doon I went And nearly broke my leg Tae see mu mither’s ain wee hoose This nicht I wud be gled At last, I’ve made it, but my limbs Are feeling un’ca sair My mither greets me wi’ a smile Noo son, sit in yer chair Your soup’s dished oot, it’s boiling hot O’ aye, a’ thocht twad be, The very nicht I come hame late Yer catering no for me Sup that, twad tak’ an oor tae cuil Yer soup I winnae hae Just spreed a great big jeely piece And a glass o’ milk will dae And get me oot my Sunday claes My tartan breeks an’ a’ And toast my shirt afore the fire It’s time I was awa’ Oh dinnae get in such a stew I sometimes think yer daft When yer faither came a courtin’ me He was’na juist sae saft I’m getting strappit in my breeks When mither gies a laugh I’m struggling wi the braces noo Jings there’s a button aff The same thing happened yince before But my brain, alert, and keen In my pouch I always carry noo A great big safety peen I get my socks drawn ower my taes And there with-oot a doot A great big hole, it met my gaze And the big tae sticking oot There’s nae time noo, tae get it darned But I’m no sae easy bate I’ll fix it in a meenit Wi some adhesive tape Ach, I’m fed up, noo whaur’s my shoon Wi rushin’, like tae choke And shair enough I hear a crack Och, there’s the steeber broke Anither knot, that’s twa that’s in’t It broke yon nicht before I’ll buy a pair o’ slip-me ons On Setterday at the store Mither this collar’s far too stiff I canna get it on Noo there’s my tie it’s slippit oot I wish I’d ne’er been born At last I get it roon my kneck My tie a’ in a frump The coat draws on, I’m ready noo Then on the byke I jump A’ doon that street like lightening gaed As fast as ony train The only thing that passed me Was a great big aeroplane I’m skimming ower the slippy road Tae luck I had tae trust And then a shot it rent the air O’ heck the tyre’s burst And then on fitt I struggle on Nae chance o’ ony lift And pair wee Jean, I thocht o’ her She will be frozen stiff At last I reach the trysting place The dear auld rustic style Wee Jean, she hugs me roon the neck I see her winsome smile O’ Jean I’m sorry that I’m late Hae ye’ been waitin’ lang An’ then I tell the tale o’ woe Hoo’ everything went wrang O’ dinna worry Jimmy dear I tae got such a shock I’ve juist got here, I’m oot o’ breath The blinkin’ clock had stopped I took her in my airms yince mair The love-licht in her een I press her closer tae my hert My ain wee darlin’ Jean God blees the lassies ane an’ a’ As lang as life shall rin O’never rin the lassies doon But aye their praises sing Noo lads when rushed tae keep a date Don’t let worry git ye doon You’ll fin it only keeps ye late When the courtin’ nicht comes roon",,213,"{'like_count': 137, 'comment_count': 19, 'num_users': 10445}",Scots Language Forum,,2023-10-21 06:02:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/41687383_298926857573822_7636263947468800000_n.jpg?stp=c31.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=SjPG_FlZ-bYAX8Ls2nn&_nc_oc=AQntOYE7LUhBbu-kbc9qV429Ujtx-yi6KNRB25CCVND7MQocHWRK4AwI-apTXDQ5g0Y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCvbHerlEIB7oOXSYMAVfzpI0Dj_YvpJza8oAJstCN_mw&oe=657D169C,https://www.facebook.com/groups/126242628908/permalink/10161304064128909,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394275357_10159637403705812_4813843255514063233_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=_dgSLpC6mFYAX_I2pKQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD6MjoL8V7EF4ITDYgJP8eTLuwku52Sn0CvQ8vFrmgrNQ&oe=654CF543

facebook,"#War- Archbishop of Goa and Daman on Friday appealed the Christians to pray and fast for peace between Israel and Palestine on October 27 In a communication released here, Fr Ferrao said that in a world marred by conflict and suffering, the ongoing strife in Israel and Palestine stands as a stark reminder of the urgent need for peace in our world. “We are witnessing a crisis that is claiming countless lives and causing immeasurable pain. Our Holy Father Francis is constantly voicing his concern for the humanitarian situation in Palestine and Israel, calling on all parties to lay down their weapons,” he said. The Archbishop noted that speaking at his General Audience on the October 18, Fr Francis said “Lay down weapons and heed the cries for peace from the poor, the people, and the innocent children. The Archbishop recalled that the Pope called on all Christians to pray and fast for peace on Friday, October 27, 2023. “He also encouraged people of other Christian denominations, other religions and all those who advocate for peace to participate as they see fit. The Pope announced that the central event on Friday would be an hour of prayer at 6 pm in St. Peter’s Square, with the goal of invoking peace for the world,” Fr Ferrao said. The Archbishop said that in response to our beloved Holy Father’s invitation, let us rise together and join him in observing coming Friday, the 27th of October, as a day of prayer, penance and fasting for peace in Israel and Palestine and between other war-torn countries and peoples. “Prayer and penance can play a vital role in this endeavour. While we encourage individuals and families to join in this global spiritual exercise, we urge our Parish Priests, Chaplains, Heads of Institutions and of Religious Communities to organize for the people under their care at least an hour of prayer for this intention,” Fr Ferrao said. #Goa #GoaNEws #Church #Christians #Palestine #Israel",,209,"{'like_count': 155, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 356677}",In Goa 24x7,,2023-10-21 06:15:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/325581168_572604257652660_309973405128730370_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=AeKTw_QDScgAX-FwtVA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAQj3CSVEEdM6qq2I0y2GSz01aoX5RE-MRbJ6UuXZA7bg&oe=655B6A48,https://www.facebook.com/100071232668129/posts/372066801844406,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393623925_372066421844444_2654768160626943356_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=umf5GIJ29KAAX9HKp1Q&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA4Jt6jbQC8yG2ODdXH_OobJ7BTVRWNKQmmLNBdkdlsRQ&oe=653A246E
facebook,"There are large anti war protests going on in major Western cities. Some of the Pro Palestine ones in New York, London were huge. But still one fundumental question remains. Does public protest against wars in western cities ultimately matter? The answer is yes, protests matter. Anti-Vietnam war protests mattered. During the Iraq war in 2002, millions of people marched in Western Cities, including Washington DC. Europe saw some of the largest anti war protests in human history. It took about 12 years by when the entire political class in the West felt the pressure and openly started talking about the futility of that war. Biden today publicly asked Israel to not repeat the ""mistakes"" America made during those WOT era wars. He can publicly say that because Biden knows that's where the people's opinion is -- some of that credit goes to those laege protests. So yes, the Anti-Iraq protests also mattered. But anti war protests matter only ""ultimately"", not ""immediately"". So what's the forecast on Palestine? As the players in Western policy making circuits age, the continuation of the status-quo in Israel-Palestine will be unsustainable. The new generation of Jews, Christians, and the population in general see the Palestinian situation unjust and not worth continuation. An ever increasing Muslim population in Western democracies will make Pro Palestine activism politically more viable down the line. So the forecast is that there will be a time when the Palestinians will have more rights, determination and live a ""better"" live than what they got right now. And that will be possible because of political pressure from Western capitals -- thanks to the young voters of today who will be the policy makers in about 15-20 years time. US is probably about 3 to 4 election cycles away from electing an American President with dramatically different approach towards a conflict that will be around 80-90 years old by then.",,208,"{'like_count': 167, 'comment_count': 19, 'num_users': 38206}",Shafquat Rabbee Anik,,2023-10-21 15:40:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/391696799_10159415260890653_363336204220816657_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7vKw-pTXEysAX9CfI69&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCltf6kE1fl6VRS3TaYxEG9NLFJGNPS10_E9XCrl_5VOw&oe=655AD17E,https://www.facebook.com/srabbee/posts/10159429658180653,

facebook,"After the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267, Llywelyn continued to prosper. One advantage was his new relationship with Edward, who had now completely given up on Wales. The heir to the English throne had switched his sights to the Holy Land, and devoted himself to raising an army for the crusade. At this stage, Edward was also concerned with undermining his rival Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Although the two had combined to destroy Simon de Montfort, they loathed each other and soon fell out again. Clare was also at loggerheads with Llywelyn, who wanted to extend the border of his new principality into Glamorgan. Since Clare held Glamorgan, conflict was inevitable. To get money for his crusade, and shaft Clare into the bargain, Edward allied with Llywelyn. In 1269 He persuaded his father, Henry III, to trigger a vital clause of the Montgomery agreement: this allowed Llywelyn to gain the homage of Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg, lord of Dinefwr, for a fee of 5000 marks. However, this could only happen if the king approved the sale. Maredudd himself had no wish to be Llywelyn's vassal, but he didn't have much choice. The sale was agreed, and Edward sent his clerk, Robert Burnell, to collect the money. It was never paid over: Llywelyn was not good with money, and the outstanding fee added to his growing mountain of debt. Even so, his relations with Edward remained cordial. In the summer the two met, for the second time, at the ford of Montgomery. Here, Edward made another concession and granted Llywelyn the homage of one Maredudd ap Gruffudd. This Maredudd was a lord of Glamorgan, and as such owed homage to Clare. Edward waved that aside and granted him to Llywelyn anyway. Anything to raise Clare's blood pressure. Llywelyn was pleased with the outcome of his meetings with Edward, as well he might be. Afterwards he sent a letter to the king, expressing his 'delight' at the talks. Sadly only a fragment of the letter survives; otherwise it might cast some very interesting light on his relationship with Edward at this time. Shortly afterwards Edward departed for the Holy Land, leaving Clare and Llywelyn to square up to each other.",,205,"{'like_count': 165, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 16585}",The 13th Century,,2023-10-21 08:40:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/378042680_758239083010535_7244218978344724192_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jkct5pBXnm0AX9j_fVr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfASSIW55PSAzVgC12Y6coZxkYywgg_kGhvMPdwgHdbhOw&oe=6559FA92,https://www.facebook.com/100064733496838/posts/783491360485307,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394705382_783491243818652_5099884725463173704_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4Iw8LWqdFX8AX_cdVB9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA-BdObe3jekQ8kuY4AdXmyhfPNDAakM4Iby0seoWDKuA&oe=6537A8FC

facebook,"Buffalo Bill Cody and Sitting Bull (Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake). When people think of Buffalo Bill Cody, they often get caught up on two historical fallacies. The first is that Bill Cody was a horrific slaughterer of the American bison, otherwise known as the buffalo. The second is that his participation in the near-extermination event of the buffalo was driven by genocidal urges and federal dollars to deny Native American tribes their primary food source in hopes of eliminating them entirely. I see this interpretation of Cody's buffalo hunting days a lot, but I don't believe it is entirely accurate. William F. Cody hunted bison to feed the westward expansion of the railroad, but only for about 18 months. By the end of 1869, he worked full-time as a scout for the Army at Fort McPherson. During those 18 months, he earned a reputation as a great buffalo hunter, but he didn’t stand on a distant hill with a high-powered rifle and a looking glass, picking off docile creatures with no danger to himself. Bill Cody hunted the same way the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Pawnee did. He rode his horse towards a herd, separated the animal he would harvest, and ran alongside it until he could get the best shot possible. Cody killed a few animals at a time and brought them back to be used to feed the men working on expanding the railroad west. Despite what many think, he was never a hide hunter and never slaughtered buffalo indiscriminately for either the choice cuts (tongue and loin) or their hides. By 1873, when desperate economic times made hide hunting more attractive, Buffalo Bill and Texas Jack had left the prairies of Nebraska and the herds of buffalo that roamed it behind to become successful (and quite wealthy) actors. They would occasionally return west to hunt but were never again a significant factor in the decline of the bison. As part of his job as a scout, Buffalo Bill was involved with several altercations with Miniconjou, Lakota, Brule, Cheyenne, etc. Still, he never set out to murder Native Americans or to eliminate the bison, the staple of their diet, directly. That said, Bill Cody did kill multiple Native American men in conflict, and those incidents, especially his combat with and killing of Yellow Hair, were inflated and magnified in dime novels and on stage. He became a legendary ""Indian fighter"" more because of the legend than the reality. Cody, like the Native people he fought against, knew that when they went to war someone was going to kill and someone was going to be killed. Each man fought desperately to ensure that he was the former, and though they were enemies, each man held a measure of respect for his adversary. Likewise, Texas Jack was involved in conflicts with Sioux, Cheyenne, and Comanche warriors and developed a reputation as an ""Indian fighter"" despite having warm relations with the Pawnee tribe, joining them on their summer buffalo hunt in 1872, writing warmly about them in national publications, and being requested personally to join them by Pawnee head chief Pitaresaru (Chief of Men). Texas Jack also involved Cayuse native Donald McKay and his wife and daughter in his show well before Buffalo Bill ever brought Sioux into his Wild West shows. Whatever failing Cody exhibited in his younger life in regard to Native Americans must be contrasted with his later life. His inclusion of Lakota in his Wild West show, including Sitting Bull himself, allowed them to travel, but more importantly, to maintain and display their ceremonial dances and customs at a time when they were prevented by the United States government and Army from holding their religious ceremonies on the reservations. Cody paid the Native men and women in his show the same as he did the white cowboys, treated them fairly, kept families together, and was regarded as a warm friend by a great many of the Lakota that traveled with him. Over time, Buffalo Bill Cody became a stalwart advocate for Native peoples and their rights. In the same way, Cody’s inclusion of the bison in his Wild West shows made sure that spectators at the shows were endeared to the animals. Over time, they became a symbol of not just the Wild West, but of America writ large. Because the hundreds of thousands of people who saw the bison in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West now cared about the animals, they supported conservation movements that brought them back from the brink of extinction. The man who earned his name as a buffalo hunter became one of the primary forces in their survival. Cody publicly blamed most of the trouble between white men and Native tribes on the white men. He said that: ""In nine cases out of ten where there is trouble between white men and Indians, it will be found that the white man is responsible Indians expect a man to keep his word.

1st Reading: Isaiah 45:1, 4–6

Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue  nations before him and  to loose the belts of kings, to open doors before him that gates may not be closed: For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I name you, though you do not know me. I am the Lord, and there is no other, besides me there is no God; I equip you, though you do not know me, that people may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is none besides me; I am the Lord, and there is no other.

Psalm 96:1 and 3, 4–5,7–8, 9–10a, and c 
Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

O sing a new song to the Lord; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Tell among the nations his glory, and his wonders among all the peoples. 

Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

For the Lord is great and highly to be praised, to be feared above all gods. For the gods of the nations are naught. It was the Lord who made the heavens. 

Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

Give the Lord, you families of peoples, give the Lord glory and power; give the Lord the glory of his name.   Bring an offering and enter his courts. 

Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

Worship the Lord in holy splendour. O tremble before him, all the earth. Say to the nations, “The Lord is king.” he will judge the peoples in fairness. 

Response: Give the Lord glory and power.

2nd Reading: 1 Thessalonians 1:1–5b
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labour of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction.

Acclamation: You shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life.

Gospel: Matthew 22:15–21
At that time: The Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle Jesus in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone’s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
 
Reflection: Although the Pharisees are primarily a religious group, they are also political nationalists who resent paying taxes to the emperor and oppose all attempts by the Romans to interfere with the Jewish way of life. The Herodians, on the other hand, are a political group who support Herod Antipas and the Romans, and are open to making changes ordered by the Romans. These opposing camps, setting aside their ideological differences, conspire to discredit Jesus and if possible to eliminate Him, their common enemy. The different Christian communities today, divided on the basis of language, caste, race, beliefs and rites, can draw positive lessons from this. Since all Christians are united by the common thread of faith in Christ, they should strive, albeit their differences, to foster unity and cooperation among themselves because, as Pope Francis exhorts, “Unity is always higher than conflict.”

facebook,"Moviment Graffitti activist Andre Callus said that not only are world leaders not doing anything about the devastation of Palestinian people but are “shaking hands with war criminals and pledging their support to keep exterminating Palestinians”. “You may think that from Malta there is not much we can do to help, but it is significant that people all over the world are gathering and saying that they recognise what is happening in Gaza as genocide,” Callus said. “When we speak to our children about this, we can tell them we were not complicit, unlike Roberta Metsola, who went to Israel to cheer them on.” Callus called on politicians to “change direction” when taking a stance on the conflict and remember that Palestinian civilians are being bombed non-stop while being deprived of food, water and electricity. Without a change in attitude, these deep wounds will not only fail to heal but will get worse, he said. “We will not forget the Palestinians, nor will allow the normalisation of Israel to keep doing as it pleases while those imprisoned on the corner of land they have left to be forgotten,” Callus continued. “It is a huge mistake and the world will not forget.

facebook,"VOI LA CE NIVEL SUNTETI? CELE 17 NIVELE ALE CONSTIINTEI: NIVELURILE DISTRUCTIVE 1. Nivelul rusinii. La nivelul asta, esti dominat de nevroza. Esti timid, retras, introvertit. Devii paranoic, crezand ca toata lumea te judeca si incepi sa ai halucinatii. Cand ti-e rusine, incepi sa compensezi prin perfectionism, prin rigiditate, si incepi sa devii un extremist moral. 2. Nivelul vinovatiei. La nivelul asta, ori esti manipulat si pedepsit, ori pedepsesti manipuland. Cel mai mare lucru care te preocupa este pacatul, incepi sa actionezi din vinovatie si s-o proiectezi asupra altora. 3. Nivelul apatiei. La nivelul asta domina disperarea, lipsa sperantei. Viata pare fara rost, viitorul pare fara rost. Traiesti intr-o stare generala de neajutorare. Esti dependent de ceilalti iar altii te percep ca pe o povara de care trebuie sa aiba grija. 4. Nivelul doliului. La nivelul asta, traiesti predominant intr-o continua melancolie, fiind trist pentru ce ai pierdut. Incepi sa vezi tristete peste tot in jurul tau. Tristete pentru conditiile vietii, incepi sa privesti viata in sine ca fiind trista. Crezi ca nu poti inlocui ceea ce ai pierdut sau ce a simbolizat pentru tine. 5. Nivelul fricii. Aici, frica iti limiteaza cresterea ca persoana si duce la inhibitii. In acel moment, cauti lideri puternici care par ca si-au cucerit fricile si crezi ca ei vor fi cei care te vor scoate din culmile disperarii si te vor elibera din“sclavie”. 6. Nivelul dorintei. Cand esti in “dorinta”, lucrul asta te poate motiva sa participi intr-o gama larga de activitati “umane”. Insasi economia se afla la nivelul dorintei. Dorinta face sa investim efort, sa atingem obiective si sa obtinem premii. Insa dorinta este si nivelul dependentei: de alcool, de tutun, de droguri. Este nivelul acumularii si al lacomiei. De ce nu functioneaza? Pentru ca satisfacerea unei dorinte este inlocuita de alta dorinta, nesatisfacuta. La nivelul asta, ramai obsedat sa acumulezi din ce in ce mai multi bani, mai ales fara un scop final pentru ei. 7. Nivelul furiei. Dorinta duce la frustrare, iar frustrarea duce la furie. Aceasta poate duce, mai departe, la actiune distructiva sau la actiune constructiva. Furia te poate catapulta spre independenta sau te poate schimba in rau. Poate duce la ura si poate avea un efect coroziv in toate ariile vietii tale. 8. Nivelul mandriei. Nivelul la care ajungi in momentul in care ai autoritate in domeniul tau. Nivelul la care majoritatea vor sa ajunga. Mandria pare frumoasa, insa e frumoasa doar in comparatie cu nivelurile anterioare. In societate, mandria are o reputatie buna si e incurajata frecvent, insa e vulnerabila, deoarece e dependenta de conditiile exterioare. Daca acele conditii exterioare nu mai sunt implinite, te poate catapulta inapoi in cele mai de jos niveluri ale constiintei. Partile negative ale mandriei sunt aroganta si negarea lucrurilor care nu se incadreaza “in tipar”, blocand cresterea ta ca persoana. NIVELURILE CONSTRUCTIVE 9. Nivelul curajului. De-abia acum incepi sa devii cu adevarat puternic. Incepi sa explorezi si sa experimentezi lucruri noi, si devii stimulat de lucrurile pe care le faci. In “curaj”, ai energia sa inveti lucruri noi, iar cresterea si educatia nu mai sunt lucruri asa de mari pentru tine. In “curaj”,ai capacitatea de a-ti privi frica in ochi si de a creste, in pofida faptului ca ea inca exista acolo. 10. Nivelul neutralitatii. In momentul asta, incetezi sa mai privesti lucrurile in alb sau negru. Incepi sa nu mai fii rigid in lucrurile pe care le faci, devii flexibil si incetezi sa mai judeci in general. Cand lucrurile nu iti ies asa cum vrei, nu te mai simti infrant, nu te mai simti speriat, nu te mai simti frustrat. In“neutralitate”, poti sa spui cu usurinta “daca nu obtin lucrul asta, nu e nici o problema, o sa-l obtin pe altul”. E nivelul la care nu mai esti intimidat cu usurinta. Nu incerci sa demonstrezi nimic, nu esti interesat de conflict sau competitie, nu vrei sa controlezi comportamentul altor persoane.Incepi sa detii cu adevarat stabilitate emotionala. 11. Nivelul dispozitiei. Nivelul la care vei avea parte de cea mai rapida crestere. E nivelul la care ti-ai depasit problemele din viata ta si esti dispus sa participi la tot ce inseamna VIATA. De-abia acum devii cu adevarat prietenos, succesul aparand automat. Incepi sa lucrezi pe orice tip de post e nevoie, si nu te simti inferior atunci cand te ocupi de “munca de jos”. Incepi sa fii empatic la nevoile celorlalti, sa-i ajuti pe ceilalti si sa contribui la bunastarea societatii. 12. Nivelul acceptarii. In “acceptare”, incetezi sa mai obtii bucurie din lucrurile exterioare tie. Nimic din ceea ce exista in afara persoanei tale nu are capacitatea sa te faca cu adevarat fericit. Iubirea nu mai e oferita sau luata inapoi de catre altcineva, ci este generata din interior. Devii activ in viata, fara sa ai vreo intentie ascunsa. Nu mai esti interesat doar sa determini “ce e bine” si “ce e rau”, ci esti dedicat sa rezolvi (truncated)",,183,"{'like_count': 98, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 46216}",Evoluție Spirituală - Conștientizări,,2023-10-21 16:14:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/321843629_923235052381449_6350973150853239356_n.jpg?stp=c0.7.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Jiojm3dnAJUAX93E-Qp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA8DCSBgrnwrBwpOPHYcW-l5M-NQ3kucue2VARN7hTyag&oe=655B137A,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1560199397779590/permalink/1737816106684584,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/392884922_354855263872727_1193660505769444979_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=5GBkhx-hk0IAX8Tg-Vi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC7Mzz0rpECw_Gg2uWORELx2heM7g34llGAnSsRLQa5AA&oe=653940BA

facebook,"بيان لوزير الخارجية بلينكن ترحب الولايات المتحدة بوصول قافلة مكونة من 20 شاحنة تحمل مساعدات إنسانية تشتد الحاجة إليها لسكان غزة، وهي الأولى منذ الهجوم الإرهابي المروع الذي شنته حماس على إسرائيل بتاريخ 7 تشرين الأول/أكتوبر. ونشكر شركاءنا في مصر وإسرائيل والأمم المتحدة على تسهيل المرور الآمن لهذه الشحنات عبر معبر رفح الحدودي. ويبدا المجتمع الدولي، بهذه القافلة، في معالجة الأزمة الإنسانية في غزة التي تركت سكان غزة دون الحصول على ما يكفي من الغذاء والماء وكذلك الرعاية الصحية والمأوى الآمن. وكان افتتاح طريق الإمداد الأساسي نتيجة لأيام من المشاركة الدبلوماسية الأمريكية الشاملة في المنطقة وكذلك التفاهم الذي توصل إليه الرئيس بايدن مع رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي بنيامين نتنياهو والرئيس المصري عبد الفتاح السيسي خلال زيارته التاريخية الأخيرة إلى إسرائيل. وعمل المبعوث الخاص ديفيد ساترفيلد، منذ تلك الزيارة، مع حكومتي إسرائيل ومصر وكذلك الأمم المتحدة للإشراف على تنفيذها. كما نحث جميع الأطراف على إبقاء معبر رفح مفتوحا لتمكين استمرار حركة المساعدات التي تعتبر ضرورية لرفاهية شعب غزة. وقد كنا واضحين: يجب على حماس ألا تتدخل في تقديم هذه المساعدات المنقذة للحياة. وإن المدنيين الفلسطينيين ليسوا مسؤولين عن الإرهاب المروع الذي تمارسه حماس، ولا ينبغي لهم أن يعانوا بسبب أعمالها المنحرفة. وكما قال الرئيس بايدن، إذا سرقت حماس هذه المساعدات أو حولتها، فإنها بذلك تثبت مرة أخرى أنها لا تهتم برفاهية الشعب الفلسطيني، ومن الناحية العملية فإنها ستعيق المجتمع الدولي من القدرة على تقديم هذه المساعدات. ويجب حماية أرواح المدنيين وكذلك يجب أن تصل المساعدات على نحو عاجل إلى المحتاجين. كما سنواصل العمل على نحو وثيق مع الشركاء في المنطقة للتأكيد على أهمية الالتزام بقانون الحرب، ودعم أولئك الذين يحاولون الوصول إلى بر الأمان أو تقديم المساعدات وكذلك تسهيل الحصول على الغذاء والماء وكذلك الرعاية الطبية والمأوى للمواطنين أينما كانوا في غزة. وإننا نواصل العمل على نحو عاجل مع مصر وإسرائيل لتسهيل قدرة المواطنين الأمريكيين وأفراد أسرهم المباشرين على الخروج من غزة بأمان ولسفر عبر مصر إلى وجهاتهم النهائية. ولا توجد أولوية أعلى من سلامة المواطنين الأمريكيين في الخارج وتستعد فرق السفارة الأمريكية بالقاهرة لمساعدة هؤلاء المواطنين الأمريكيين. كما إننا نعمل بلا كلل، بما في ذلك مع الدول الشريكة والحليفة التي لديها مواطنون في غزة، لضمان قدرتهم على مغادرة منطقة الصراع بأمان. https://eg.usembassy.gov/ar/humanitarian-assistance-for-gaza/ The United States welcomes the delivery of a 20-truck convoy carrying much needed humanitarian assistance to the people in Gaza, the first since Hamas’s horrific October 7 terrorist attack on Israel. We thank our partners in Egypt and Israel, and the United Nations, for facilitating the safe passage of these shipments through the Rafah border crossing. With this convoy, the international community is beginning to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has left residents of Gaza without access to sufficient food, water, medical care, and safe shelter. The opening of this essential supply route was the result of days of exhaustive U.S. diplomatic engagement in the region and an understanding President Biden reached with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi during his recent historic visit to Israel. Since that visit, Special Envoy David Satterfield has worked with the governments of Israel and Egypt, as well as the United Nations, to oversee its implementation. We urge all parties to keep the Rafah crossing open to enable the continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the people of Gaza. We have been clear: Hamas must not interfere with the provision of this life-saving assistance. Palestinian civilians are not responsible for Hamas’s horrific terrorism, and they should not be made to suffer for its depraved acts. As President Biden stated, if Hamas steals or diverts this assistance it will have demonstrated once again that it has no regard for the welfare of the Palestinian people and as a practical matter it will hinder the international community from being able to provide this aid. Civilian lives must be protected, and assistance must urgently reach those in need. We will continue to work closely with partners in the region to stress the importance of adhering to the law of war, supporting those who are trying to get to safety or provide assistance, and facilitating access to food, water, medical care, and shelter for citizens wherever they are located in Gaza. We continue to work urgently in partnership with Egypt and Israel to facilitate the ability of U.S. citizens and their immediate family members to exit Gaza safely and travel via Egypt to their final destinations. There is no higher priority than the safety of U.S. citizens abroad, and U.S. Embassy Cairo teams are poised to assist these U.S. citizens. We are working tirelessly, including with partner and allied nations with citizens in Gaza, to secure their ability to safely depart the conflict area.",,181,"{'like_count': 31, 'comment_count': 77, 'num_users': 1293021}",U.S. Embassy Cairo,,2023-10-21 16:39:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/196306670_145352477637736_867538713209543245_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=FmEE8U5z3IQAX-q-oaC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfACy1Y16lsPOlH3q21n9X4bxTOoNu5f60bro8L_xgellw&oe=657D48E9,https://www.facebook.com/100064889524189/posts/710850594421252,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/9973210563150655398?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2v9ipibika81v.cloudfront.net%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F156%2F2015%2F12%2Fdefault-blog-seal.png&fb_obo=1&utld=cloudfront.net&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbER62J2E-DpYZG5FVbLAZSSDfHleJ9dXcTMPB1zNHfoGw&oe=6535DB41

Matatandaan natin na ang sektor nang paggawa ang naging sentro nang Infiltrasyon at recruitment nang teroristang CPP/NPA/NDF upang sila ay makapangikil nang pera at maka recruit nang bagong kasapi para sa hanay nang teroristang CPP/NPA/NDF upang isulong ang teroristang gawain sa timog katagalugan. Lubos naman ang pasasalamat nang mga empleyado nang F.C.C. Philippine Corp. dahil marami silang nalaman na bagong impormasyon lalo sa banta nang teroristang CPP/NPA/NDF sa kanilang hanay. #2CMOBn #TFUgnay #ATR2040 #StrongerArmyStrongerCountry #PhilippineArmy",,180,"{'like_count': 90, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 9170}","2nd Civil Military Operations Battalion, CMOR, PA",,2023-10-21 03:53:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/343448212_983782102986980_5581841956134914202_n.jpg?stp=c5.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=-CU4bSlnXXYAX9TydER&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAtKwAbipN1kLm2332OldXZ7aMQ9YQfRPoffXk_Ert98w&oe=655A4016,https://www.facebook.com/100064644611754/posts/732463688918445,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394593459_732462885585192_620635952926643633_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=VMdr7O0R1TEAX9s4T5T&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDzcak1rgQTajl3hchVCrMBeemLJd0cLPj9heqb3bE6HA&oe=653894E5

facebook,"#StoryOfTheDay...Between #MichaelJackson ""Another Great Team"" and Rodney Jerkins marked a long collaboration. In an interview with VLAD TV, Rodney Jerkins spoke at length about Michael Jackson.

According to Rodney Jerkins, a demo of the song ""If I Told You That"" was made by his team as a duet between Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson using two similar voices.

For Jerkins, it seemed like the perfect time to bring together the two stars who had never worked together before.

However, MJ would have told Rodney Jerkins, ""No, I don't want to do a duet right now.

So Clive Davis, producer and friend of Whitney's, who had already worked with George Michael, enlisted the latter for this duo.

Released in 1998 ""If I Told You That"" was on Whitney Houston's album ""My Love is your Love"". The song was then re-recorded for the best-of "" Whitney: The Greatest Hits "", released in 2000, as a duet with George Michael.

Rodney Jerkins again recounted that his first work session with Michael Jackson took place in 1999 at the home of Carole Bayer Sager.

He confided that he was very intimidated when it was not in his nature, he who was used to controlling everything in the studio and who had already, despite his young age, worked with other singing stars. After 2-3 hours of composing, MJ asked him to stay and continue working on his new album.

Michael Jackson then arranged for Rodney Jerkins and his production team to work in Los Angeles.

According to Rodney Jerkins, working with Michael Jackson has allowed him to learn things he didn't know about the business, about music publishing, about the need to challenge himself to always do better musically and melodically.   

He explains that he developed a friendship with Michael Jackson  outside of the studio by inviting her to his home and also to his parents' house for lunch or dessert with a Michael Jackson who loved his mom's peach cobbler.

In another meeting, while work on the ""Invincible"" project was not quite finished, Michael Jackson had asked Rodney Jerkins if he was willing to sell his publishing rights to the material recorded for the album.

Finally, two days later, Michael Jackson called him and told him to forget the idea.

Rodney Jerkins recalls that at the time MJ did not just own the Beatles' song catalog, but half of the Sony/ATV catalog, which included many other stars of the song (Babyface, Mariah Carey, ...). MJ was a music publishing giant.

Concerning his studio work, the song ""You Rock My Word"" remains for Jerkins one of the favorite titles of his collaboration with Michael Jackson.

Even today, people still talk to him about it as a classic Michael Jackson, but Rodney Jerkins, lets a bit of bitterness show when he says that this title, like the others he collaborated on, could have had a greater career if Tommy Mottola and Sony hadn't been in conflict with Michael Jackson to the point of stopping the promotion very quickly.

He acknowledges that the sales of Invincible have nothing to do with Michael Jackson's previous albums but feels that with only one music video released for ""You Rock My World"", it is a far cry from the multiple music videos Michael Jackson used to release to promote his albums.

Rodney Jerkins explains that Michael Jackson had a vision for each of her albums. And when he worked with him, it was the same thing, MJ said ""we're going to release that track first, then we're going to do a music video for 'Threatened'..."".

Rodney Jerkins recalled that at the time, in 2001, Michael Jackson did not really have the opportunity to promote his album.

Despite all the disappointment of having seen the promotion around the album ""Invincible"" almost stopped after his first single, Jerkins keeps the satisfaction of having created a King of Pop classic with ""You Rock My World"".

He explains that Michael was different from all the other artists in the studio. He gave a lot of himself, he interpreted literally all his songs, to the point of being sweaty and having to change his shirts 3 times during the recording of ""You Rock My World"".

He gave so much energy in the recording booth.

Vocally, Jerkins places MJ in a Top 5 of the best singers, along with Marvin Gaye, Jackie Wilson, Sam Cook while acknowledging that he was the most unique/recognizable vocalist we've ever had.

According to Rodney Jerkins, nowadays, the times want us to believe someone when they say something happened, when in fact we don't know what happened because we weren't there.

He never saw anything inappropriate from DOJ, and he spent a lot of time with him.

Rodney Jerkins explains that he does not buy the false information spread by the propaganda and he believes that the accusers of ""Leaving Neverland"", should be ashamed, to use the cowardly process of accusing and bringing someone to justice after his death. 

In 2007, Rodney Jerkins confided that he had again collaborated with Michael Jackson by visiting Ireland.

facebook,"Sometimes the line of what you will accept is very long, but when it's crossed you are done... game, set and match. To continue on with the emotional tug of war becomes counterproductive to your own healing and the best thing to do is call a truce, let it go and walk away. Often anger is not worth your time and energy. Tip your hat to the lesson learned, trigger worked through, incompatibility, growing apart or grace through change. This isn't a defeat, my friend. It's a choice of beliefs, values and where and in whom you choose to invest and engage your energy, your time, your emotions and your love. Let them have their learning space and you be in yours. Let the dice of distance roll and honor your ability to choose the direction of your life. This is your game to play or leave. Unfortunately what's ""fair"" is always subjective. Listen to your soul. Examine your heart. Do what feels right and let go of the drama, the conflict, the stress. Life is short. Live it on your best terms with integrity, honesty and heart.

facebook,"Filipino youth activists staged a protest in front of the Commission on Human Rights in solidarity with Palestine's struggle for liberation today. The mobilization was led by the League of Filipino Students and other progressive youth groups. “There is no conflict between Israel and Palestine, only resistance from the Palestinian people against decades of attacks by the US-backed Israeli government,” said Lloyd Manango, League of Filipino Students vice chairperson. Israel’s continuous attacks and bombings in the Gaza Strip since October 7 have caused the deaths of 4,000 Palestinians, most of whom are women and children. In over two weeks, Israel has struck Gaza with 6,000 bombs after the militant group Hamas launched its offensive against Israel. The youth groups also staged a candle-lighting protest in condemnation of the killings waged by the Israeli government. Progressive groups also called on the Filipino youth to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine.

facebook,"REO Speedwagon's 1971 debut album was with their original lead singer, Terry Luttrell. Kevin Cronin took over that role for their next effort, R.E.O./T.W.O. (1972), but it was rough sledding, and while they were making their third album, Ridin' the Storm Out (1973), he left over conflict with guitarist Gary Richrath and other creative tensions. Cronin returned to the band in 1976, which meant moving from Chicago to Los Angeles, where they had relocated. On that trip, he had lots of time to think about all the changes in his life, and how he was (quite literally) rolling with them. The song hit him in a flash: he started writing the lyrics on a brown paper bag in his Ford Pinto while he was driving. Released as the first single from their 1978 album You Can Tune a Piano, but You Can't Tuna Fish, the song became their biggest hit to that point, reaching #58. The band made a music video for this song in 1978, three years before MTV went on the air. Directed by Arnold Levine, the black-and-white footage was shot at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri at their show on May 13, 1978. When MTV launched in 1981, they played the video, as REO Speedwagon were huge at the time, with a string of hits from their Hi Infidelity album.",,172,"{'like_count': 112, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 429125}",Ultimate 70's Fan Page,,2023-10-21 01:17:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/401676210_756857579801583_7893292380631013973_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3ePVFMyUyv0AX9CWzKy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfALeLk1w4Izj8G1c_ssuAK0VEYGUVE6Paz4eFc00qszmg&oe=655A0136,https://www.facebook.com/100064320447209/posts/741167758037232,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/10199829359680811159?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FjeHkaSH0Xw8%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=ytimg.com&stp=c0.0.1280.720a_dst-emg0_q75_s1280x720&ccb=13-1&oh=06_AbH_GXlySKjpoqYUN5S3mJuRAHgzEunwqB6XG2jAhQOeig&oe=6539E48C&_nc_sid=ff403b

facebook,"The Most Great Peace In the midst of the serene wilderness, surrounded by towering ancient trees and a gentle breeze rustling through the leaves, Shunkmanu gathered his four beloved grandchildren – Oliver, Maya, Nahtayu, and Ella – for a special evening under the open sky. They sat in a circle around a crackling fire, the stars above them illuminating the night. Shunkmanu began to speak with the wisdom earned through decades of working with Indigenous peoples worldwide. ""My dear grandchildren,"" he began, ""tonight, I want to share with you a vision that many people of goodwill have held throughout the ages, a vision of something called 'The Most Great Peace.' It's a peace that countless seers, poets, and sacred teachings have spoken of for generations."" As the flames danced in the fire, Shunkmanu continued, ""The Most Great Peace, my grandchildren, is a dream of a world where all nations come together in harmony. It's a vision of a world where everyone can look at Mother Earth, with all its diverse peoples, and see it as one interconnected whole."" Ella, the eldest grandchild, leaned in closer, her eyes filled with curiosity. ""Is such a thing possible, Grandfather?"" Shunkmanu smiled, his eyes reflecting the hope and determination of a lifetime. ""Yes, Granddaughter, it is not only possible but inevitable. You see, we are at a unique moment in history. We can choose to continue down the path of conflict and suffering or embrace this vision of peace through consultation and cooperation."" With her deep empathy for all living things, Maya nodded in agreement. ""But, Grandfather, how do we make this peace a reality when there is so much discord and disagreement in the world?"" Shunkmanu paused, gazing at the stars as if seeking guidance. ""My dear Maya, it begins with each one of us, with our choices and actions. We must listen to one another, respect our differences, and work together to find common ground. The problems that confront nations can no longer be solved in isolation. We must come together as a world family, in harmony with our Mother Earth and all Life."" Nahtayu, the thoughtful observer of the group, spoke up. ""What if some people refuse to change their old ways?""’ Shunkmanu nodded knowingly. ""Change is often met with resistance, but we must persist with patience and compassion. We must be the examples of the peace we seek, and over time, others will join us on this journey."" Ella, the youngest and full of innocence, looked up at the stars and said, ""I want to see this Most Great Peace, Grandfather. Can we make it happen?"" Tears glistened in Shunkmanu's eyes as he hugged Ella tightly. ""Yes, my dear Ella, we can. With the hellp and guidance of our Great Spirit we can do anything. We can plant the seeds of peace in our hearts and in the hearts of those around us. Remember, we are all interconnected, and our actions, no matter how small, can ripple out and create a world filled with the peace and harmony we envision."" And so, under the vast canopy of stars, Shunkmanu shared his understanding about the coming of Peace on Earth with his beloved grandchildren, nurturing a dream that, like the fire that warmed them that night, would continue to burn brightly in their hearts for generations to come. As the night deepened, Shunkmanu continued to share his insights with his beloved grandchildren. ""You see, my dear ones,"" he said, ""world peace is not just a distant hope; it's an inevitability. It's the natural course of human evolution. Throughout history, we have faced many challenges, conflicts, and struggles, but we have also made incredible progress in understanding and connecting with one another."" With a glimmer of hope in his eyes, Nahtayu asked, ""But Grandfather, why do you believe that world peace is inevitable?"" Shunkmanu leaned forward, his expression earnest. ""It's because of the choices we have today that were never available to previous generations. We live in an age where communication and information flow freely across borders. We can see the beauty and diversity of our world, and we can also witness the consequences of our actions."" Maya added, ""So, it's like we're all becoming more aware of our interconnectedness."" ""Yes, exactly,"" Shunkmanu replied. ""When people realize that we are all part of one world family, that our well-being is intertwined with the well-being of others, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify conflict and violence. This awareness is growing, and it's spreading across the world."" Nahtayu chimed in, ""But what about the challenges, Grandfather? There are still so many conflicts and injustices."" Shunkmanu nodded in agreement. ""Yes, there will be challenges along the way. Change is often met with resistance, and old patterns of behavior can be deeply ingrained. But the very fact that we are aware of these challenges and are discussing them means that progress is being made. We have the knowledge and the capacity to address these issues and move toward peace.""

facebook,"Did you know that 2 years ago UAE's foreign minister chastised much of the West for not taking a tougher stance on Hamas? At a time when Western media gobble up whatever Palestinians say, while BBC refuses to call Hamas a ""terrorist"" organisation, seeing an Arab country openly denounce it is not something you would necessarily expect. 🔴 But this world is so comically twisted that the most civilised Muslim countries in the the world are... the absolute monarchies of the Gulf :) In fact, in many ways they are better places to live than even the West is - particularly UAE, which has been open to foreign investment and migration for many years now, while for years one of the most isolated countries on Earth - Saudi Arabia - is following in its footsteps. 🔴 They are increasingly more developed, offer rising (sometimes very high - like Dubai or Abu Dhabi) living standards, suffer from little crime, have very low taxation and are thoroughly immune to the woke nonsense. But why would these Muslim Arabs speak so openly against Hamas? And, in fact, why have they turned away from Palestinians a long time ago, with Shia Iran being the main supporter of their cause these days? Because, unlike the bleeding-heart Westerners, they understand the subversive nature of organisations like Hamas as well as complete corruption of Palestinian leadership, which has now become manipulated by Iran to wage its holy war on Israel, that Arab rulers want nothing to do with (maybe except for Qatar). Hamas was spun-off from Muslim Brotherhood - the same organisation which has for decades tried to influence sociopolitical situation in the Muslim world, with the ultimate aim of a political takeover (e.g. in Egypt, where it briefly succeeded following the fall of Mubarak after the Arab Spring) and imposition of distinctly conservative, Islamic governance. This is why it tried to leverage the regional unrest of 2010s up and down the region, undermining i.a. the Gulf monarchies. 🔴 Emiratis and most of the other Arab rulers are very clear-eyed about it. While they are sympathetic towards creation of a Palestinian state, they also view Palestinians as pawns in Iranian hands, trying to destabilise the region. They must also view Palestinian leadership as utterly incapable of self-governance, offering dim prospects of a reasonable resolution of the conflict with Israel. And Israel is not a threat to Arab nations - Iran is. And, ironically, so are many pan-Islamic organisations. Why would they support reckless Palestinians when there's so much to be earned from cooperation with the Jews? Israel is not going away, after all, and it doesn't want to attack anybody either, so why fight it? Arab leaders understand that they have nothing to gain by participating in endless sectarian violence and that if their economies are to survive in the future without oil (or its diminished importance) they have to become an attractive part of the globalised world and not be perceived as backward, violent fundamentalists. They are so rational about it all because their self-preservation depends on it.",,154,"{'like_count': 109, 'comment_count': 26, 'num_users': 30072}",Critical Spectator,,2023-10-21 03:08:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352238793_654473106721732_8208518943407117173_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8x1dfcAuWJAAX-vhCco&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDoyth8BBPqVJqadFMrpRKihzW7HjUjoWULue8-_w1Hsw&oe=6559EC35,https://www.facebook.com/100044208020618/posts/887539576062968,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394071703_887524519397807_7070611873965967209_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YveHyUYw16oAX_7nvDI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD3Fn-0KJBbFBcVLuRz_WtIaAAK9b_nVeT8H18w53JKjA&oe=65463F32
facebook,"The Value of Each Other As much as the world around us tries to lure us into self-dependency, God created us for each other. For community. For a life that’s not alone. The author of Proverbs said it like this: “A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity.” Proverbs‬ ‭17:17‬ ‭NIV We’ll all face hard times—sometimes when we least expect it. But a friend’s genuine care can mean the world, a sibling’s unconditional love can’t be replaced, and a neighbor’s practical help is priceless. We need each other more than we realize: emotionally, practically, and spiritually. If you’ve found yourself in a busy season where you’ve unintentionally neglected your true friends or been too busy for your real family, now is the time to reprioritize. If there’s unresolved conflict with a friend or family member, and it’s slowly deteriorating the relationship, now is the time to set aside your pride and choose to make things right. If you’re silently struggling alone, now is the moment to let someone in. Give them a call, send them a text, or show up on their doorstep. If you can’t be honest and vulnerable, it will be difficult to get help. Not only do you need people, but those same people need you. You have strengths, gifts, talents, and a personality that’s unique to you and beneficial to them—and vice versa. Why bury them in the ground, in the name of autonomy, when they can benefit others? Sometimes we need to ask for help, and sometimes we need to be the help. Do you need help, or can you offer it? Could you use a hand, or do you have some time, money, advice, or expertise? If you’re tempted to self-isolate, don’t forget: we were meant to live life together.",,153,"{'like_count': 117, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 108234}",Luciana Natasha Lungu,,2023-10-21 05:30:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/342523958_219044727403270_2904877826765420150_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QYgkr5iccEkAX8d8Edt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDcuiyy2PhW3ZM4hcClptpoKk2GkSKY7u7zuVmFL_ksqw&oe=655ABF5A,https://www.facebook.com/100063080568778/posts/681820297263983,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391681352_681820370597309_2812112085451514322_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3IsVoFsQ_jUAX-XTHTS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDxOa37UqChB7U9BwdekCmUa7Avj_-VxDtHfM7eImsoIg&oe=6538CD2A

facebook,"Memorendum Submitted to H/CM N.Biren Singh by Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) Twitter : https://x.com/stdcm_org:=:https://twitter.com/stdcm_org Website: https://stdcm.org:=:https://stdcm.org/ To, Shri N. Biren Singh, Hon'ble Chief Minister, Manipur. Imphal, the 6th October, 2023 Sub: In the matter of the demand for inclusion of the ethnic Meitei/Meetei Community, one of the Indigenous Communities of Manipur, in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list under Article 342(1) of the Constitution of India. Hon'ble Sir, The present conflict in Manipur is now five months old with no immediate settlement in sight. The Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) had refrained from raising the voice for inclusion of the Meitei/Meetei community in the ST List during this period as it was felt that focus should be on bringing in normalcy in the State. STDCM had submitted a number of representations/memoranda on the matter highlighting the reasons for the demand for inclusion of the Meitei/Meetei community in the ST List along with the rationale. But unfortunately, till now even after the passage of more than a decade since the demand was first raised, the State Government has not initiated any steps towards this end where recommendation of the State Government is mandatory. The State Government had to just examine the five criteria and if the Meitei/Meetei community fulfils the same, positive recommendation shall be submitted to the Centre. And, it is for the Centre to examine the matter and finally a Bill is to be placed before the Parliament and after passing the bill, necessary notification to the effect has to be issued. The STDCM, as mentioned earlier refrained from moving the agenda during the first five months of the present conflict so as to enable the State Government to focus on bringing in normalcy in the State. But even after the passage of five months normalcy is till elusive, which is not surprising as the matter is quite complex. However, the STDCM has been compelled to submit this reminder as it is felt that granting of ST status to the Meitei/Meetei community can be one of the crucial aspects for the resolution of the present conflict. The STDCM is ever ready to negotiate with other existing ST communities to address their apprehensions, if any. Further, if timely action is not taken immediately, the Meitei/Meetei community may become the only indigenous community in the entire North-East of the country which is not provided with such constitutional safeguards as may be guaranteed to its indigenous communities. Without such Constitutional safeguards they will not be able to compete and survive with their heads held high in this competitive world. Your honour may be aware that there is already a Bill pending before the Rajya Sabha, namely The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill 2019 wherein five communities of Assam i.e., Chutiya, Matak, Moran, Koch Rajbongshi and Tai Ahom along with its 36 other communities are proposed to be included in the ST List(Copy enclosed for kind reference). Since the Bill is pending (since 9th January, 2019) with Rajya Sabha it does not lapse and it will be only a question of time that the Bill is cleared by both Houses of the Parliament and becomes a law of the land. Tai Ahom who are much more advanced in many respects than the Meitei/Meetei. Once the Bill is passed, the Meitei/Meetei will be the only indigenous community in the entire North-East which is not delared as ST and our claim for indigeneity may even be challenged on its constitutionality. The present time is critical for the Meitei/Meetei tribe and if positive step to include it in the ST List is not taken up urgently, the fate of the Meitei/Meetei tribe will hang on a thin thread and its survival just cannot be ensured, despite the fact that it has a 2000 year old history. Those in the helm of affairs now will be judged by their action either as a villain who assisted in destroying the Meitei/Meetei tribe or a saviour who ensured that the tribe continues to survive with its glory. Therefore, the STDCM on behalf of the Meitei/Meetei tribe once again beseech you kindly to initiate urgent necessary action and furnish the required recommendations along with the essential documents to the Government of India for inclusion of the Meitei/Meetei tribe in the Scheduled Tribe List under Article 342(1) of the Constitution of India so that the Bill regarding the Meitei/Meetei tribe can be placed before Parliament and discussed and passed along with the afore-mentioned pending Bill. We look forward to your kind positive action on this matter. Enclosed: As above Yours faithfully, 1. Dhiraj Yumnam President 2. K.

#ATMA #SAKSHATKAR #EXPERIENCE

Earlier I used to get carried away by my thoughts and worry. But nowadays I am aware that thoughts are simply flowing and I do not get disturbed or worried by them. 

Earlier it was like we are walking in darkness, hardly anything was visible, and there were worries about what might lay ahead. But now with the torch of awareness shining bright, things are quite clear.

I can let the thoughts be. I don’t try to control them anymore. 

I can see that worry or hurt are stories created by mind and I can be detached. I no longer react if someone treats me badly. I can see, feel and understand where the other person is coming from and accordingly respond. 

My mind no longer takes me to the past, even if I remember an otherwise hurtful incident that could have happened during seva or business or likewise,  I can now see clearly why that person had behaved the way he did. I could understand their circumstances, restlessness and helplessness. It no longer feels personal and hence I am not getting hurt by that memory. With increased clarity, suffering is not getting produced. 

Even if I get hurt, I am able to move on because clarity gives a different perspective. I don’t get stuck with the situation or person. It happened the way it did. That’s all. There could be numerous reasons why it happened. It is alright. I don’t signify things anymore. 

Forgiveness was something that was quite hard for me. Now as I am able to detach people and what they do, forgiveness is happening. I don’t need to forgive. It is all automatic. Forgiveness is spontaneous these days. Computations and calculations are absent. So is disturbance and judgement. Everything is beautiful, there is no need to complicate anything.

Connections with people have improved a lot. I used to assign nameplate to people. Now those frameworks have fallen. I can feel and connect with their suffering, even with those who have been very troublesome in my life earlier. 

I have become more sensitive to birds, animals and plants as I now know that we are all part of the same thing. I don’t know what that thing is but there is connection and compassion with everything.

Energy levels have shifted a lot on a psychological, spiritual and on physical level too. 

Inner dialogues are happening but they are not taking me anywhere. They are not distracting me. They are just there and I let them be.

Earlier I used to face with lot of conflicts. Nowadays when conflict happens, soon it is replaced by clarity.

15 years ago I was very famous for being an angry man even in Seva. Anger used to remain for days. It has significantly reduced and people around me can experience the same. 
I am a living testimony of transformation through Amma Bhagavan’s processes.

Fear is totally dead. Whatever happens the mind does take me down the path of fear. Even physical fear is quite less. Awareness and sense of a situation or danger is there. But fear is absent.

Thank you Sri Amma Bhagavan for this beautiful inner states you have gifted me with. It is invaluable to me.

Namaste, 
Amma Bhagavan Sharanam 🙏🙏🌸🙏🌸
My frustration, anger and hurt for my father has increasingly decreased in past few weeks. I not only understand him but I feel compassion and calmness while thinking of him and talking with him. As I am very well aware of the fact that I am in process of healing but there is no more blaming on father. There is no thought regarding it. I have noticed a change in my father over past few weeks as I observed my inner world and outer world. He has become more calm and relaxed. While talking he crack more jokes and his tone is not loud (which indicates aggressions or anger). He barely taunts and has begin to listen and understand. He doesn't nag me, my brother and mother for small things. As there is a drastic change in my inner world, I noticed a huge change in the outer world.
Jai Bolo Mukti Pradata Sri ParamJyoti Amma Bhagavan ki Jai

facebook,"How to Strengthen Your Relationship...✍🏾 Everyone’s relationship is unique, and people come together for many different reasons. But there are some things that good relationships have in common. Knowing the basic principles of healthy relationships helps keep them meaningful, fulfilling and exciting in both happy times and sad: So what makes a healthy love relationship? 1. Staying involved with each other... Some relationships get stuck in peaceful coexistence, but without truly relating to each other and working together. While it may seem stable on the surface, lack of involvement and communication increases distance. When you need to talk about something important, the connection and understanding may no longer be there. 2. Getting through conflict... Some couples talk things out quietly, while others may raise their voices and passionately disagree. The key in a strong relationship, though, is not to be fearful of conflict. You need to be safe to express things that bother you without fear of retaliation, and be able to resolve conflict without humiliation, degradation or insisting on being right. 3. Keeping outside relationships and interests alive... No one person can meet all of our needs, and expecting too much from someone can put a lot of unhealthy pressure on a relationship. Having friends and outside interests not only strengthens your social network, but brings new insights and stimulation to the relationship, too. 4. Communicating... Honest, direct communication is a key part of any relationship. When both people feel comfortable expressing their needs, fears, and desires, trust and bonds are strengthened. Nonverbal cues—body language like eye contact, leaning forward or away, or touching someone’s arm—are critical to communication.",,147,"{'like_count': 141, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 43194}",Advise on Relationship matters,,2023-10-21 14:58:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/305109127_483882603747634_2838648903528478657_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NPqbNuLJ2eQAX_PEGY4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfACY5syZnv59ZhpOqmycHoLBwLw3YtxQ6QK5nUSe2TC9Q&oe=655AC797,https://www.facebook.com/100063776958276/posts/828091262660098,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391589986_828091175993440_3589865041999149844_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bQErcjavr8QAX9Nt0K8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDh83N4KDGOLQ6VYJkxtO-C7e4ZHeccsKs_zaDaw-3dDg&oe=6538B0B7

She protects her devotees from evil powers and safeguards them. It is believed that Goddess Durga is the combined form of powers of Goddesses Lakshmi, Kali and Saraswati. She is associated with protection, strength, motherhood, destruction and wars. Her legend centres around combating evils and demonic forces that threaten peace, prosperity and dharma; representing the power of good over evil. ଓଁ ଆଧାରରୂପେ ଚାଧେୟେ ଧୃତିରୂପେ ଧୁରନ୍ଧରେ । ଧ୍ରୁବେ ଧ୍ରୁବପଦେ ଧୀରେ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୧॥ ଶିବାକାରେ ଶକ୍ତିରୂପେ ଶକ୍ତିସ୍ଥେ ଶକ୍ତିବିଗ୍ରହେ । ଶକ୍ତାଚାରପ୍ରିୟେ ଦେବି ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୨॥ ଜୟଦେ ଜଗଦାନଦେ ଜଗଦେକପ୍ରପୂଜିତେ । ଜୟ ସର୍ବଗତେ ଦୁର୍ଗେ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୩॥ ସୂକ୍ଷ୍ମାତିସୂକ୍ଷ୍ମରୂପେ ଚ ପ୍ରାଣାପାନାଦିରୂପିଣି । ଭାବାଭାବସ୍ୱରୂପେ ଚ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୪॥ କାଳାଧିରୂପେ କାଳେଶେ କାଳାକାଳବିଭେଦିନି । ସର୍ବସ୍ୱରୂପେ ସର୍ବଜ୍ଞେ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୫॥ ମହାବିଘ୍ନେ ମହୋତ୍ସାହେ ମହାମାୟେ ବରପ୍ରଦେ । ପ୍ରପଞ୍ଚସାରେ ସାଧ୍ୱୀଶେ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୬॥ ଆଗମ୍ୟେ ଜଗତାମାଦ୍ୟେ ମାହେଶ୍ୱରି ବରାଙ୍ଗନେ । ଅଶେଷରୂପେ ରୂପସ୍ଥେ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୭॥ ତୀର୍ଥଯଜ୍ଞା -ତପୋଦାନ-ଯ୍ୟୋଗସାରେ ଜଗନ୍ମୟି । ତ୍ୱମେବ ସର୍ବଂ ସର୍ବସ୍ଥେ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୮॥ ଦୟାରୂପେ ଦୟାଦୃଷ୍ଟେ ଦୟାର୍ଦ୍ରେ ଦୁଃଖମୋଚନି । ସର୍ବାପତ୍ତାରିକେ ଦୁର୍ଗେ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୯॥ ଆଗମ୍ୟଧାମ-ଧାମସ୍ଥେ ମହାଯୋଗୀଶ-ହୃତ୍ପୁରେ । ଅମେୟଭାବକୂଟସ୍ଥେ ଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରି ନମୋଽସ୍ତୁ ତେ ॥ ୧୦॥ ଇତି ଶ୍ରୀଜଗଦ୍ଧାତ୍ରୀସ୍ତୋତ୍ରଂ ସମ୍ପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣମ୍ । Mata Durga is the Goddess of Strength and Justice who brings compassion, peace, calm and order to the chaos, destruction and conflict in any situation. She appears to us on Her tiger, looking completely serene and composed, dressed in a red silk sari and carrying various weapons and tools in her eight to eighteen arms. In the Hindu traditions Mata Durga is the Divine Mother Goddess who presides over the seasons of life, death, and birth. To many, She is simply DEVI, which means ‘Goddess’ and comes from the sanskrit ‘Deva’, which means ‘to shine’. She is the Great Mother who helps us removing the limitations and emotional and mental obscurations that prevent us from shining the Divine Light we all carry within our hearts. Durga, which means the invincible, unconquerable and unassailable one, is the name this powerful and courageous Goddess takes after Her defeat of the buffalo-headed demon Durgama. She teaches us that the divine light of truth and wisdom will always prevail over disorder and pain. The Devi Mahatmya is a dramatic narration of the different battles the Great Goddess fights to stop all that is threatening the balance and harmony between humans and nature. Its various chapters describe how only the Great Goddess can stop the asuras (demons) that are causing so much bloodshed, violence and destruction on the earth. The demons represent the afflicted ego qualities in humans and Devi confronts the demons of arrogance, pride, hypocrisy, greed, rage, discrimination, injustice and more. ଶ୍ରୀଦଶମହାବିଦ୍ୟାକବଚମ୍ ବିନିଯୋଗଃ - ଓଁ ଅସ୍ୟ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାକବଚସ୍ୟ ଶ୍ରୀସଦାଶିବ ଋଷିଃ ଉଷ୍ଣିକ୍ ଛନ୍ଦଃ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟା ଦେବତା ସର୍ବସିଦ୍ଧିପ୍ରାପ୍ତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ପାଠେ ବିନିଯୋଗଃ ॥ ଋଷ୍ୟାଦି ନ୍ୟାସଃ - ଶ୍ରୀସଦାଶିବଋଷୟେ ନମଃ ଶିରସୀ ଉଷ୍ଣିକ୍ ଛନ୍ଦସେ ନମଃ ମୁଖେ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାଦେବତାୟୈ ନମଃ ହୃଦି ସର୍ବସିଦ୍ଧିପ୍ରାପ୍ତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ପାଠେ ବିନିଯୋଗାୟ ନମଃ ॥ ମାନସପୁଜନମ୍ - ଓଁ ଲଂ ପୃଥ୍ୱୀତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ଗନ୍ଧଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ସମର୍ପୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ହଂ ଆକାଶତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ପୁଷ୍ପଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ସମର୍ପୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ଯଂ ବାୟୁତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ଧୂପଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ଆଘ୍ରାପୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ରଂ ଅଗ୍ନିତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ଦୀପଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ଦର୍ଶୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ବଂ ଜଳତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ନୈବେଦ୍ୟଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ନିବେଦୟାମି ନମଃ । ଓଁ ସଂ ସର୍ବତତ୍ତ୍ୱାତ୍ମକଂ ତାମ୍ବୂଳଂ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାପ୍ରୀତ୍ୟର୍ଥେ ନିବେଦୟାମି ନମଃ ॥ ଅଥ ଶ୍ରୀମହାବିଦ୍ୟାକବଚମ୍ । ଓଁ ପ୍ରାଚ୍ୟାଂ ରକ୍ଷତୁ ମେ ତାରା କାମରୂପନିବାସିନୀ । ଆଗ୍ନେୟ୍ୟାଂ ଷୋଡଶୀ ପାତୁ ଯାମ୍ୟାଂ ଧୂମାବତୀ (truncated)",,143,"{'like_count': 102, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 64298}",ନୀଳାଦ୍ରିନାଥ ଶ୍ରୀଜଗନ୍ନାଥ । Neeladrinath Shri Jagannath,,2023-10-21 09:23:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/358623960_849747990042552_191255908297743546_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rsyoL4iB5w0AX8hmuVw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAUzK76q8SaryJSCKhMDjmD32TTi6DefPj_ccCqCzjQiw&oe=655A8C19,https://www.facebook.com/100050220771132/posts/911036863913664,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394404399_911036313913719_8378083108454421799_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=AgJcgQ0nMT8AX8HgoxP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAqPdSCUr0TnaV5XAf3F9undc0Pfq8jOuii3-6YW_Xyuw&oe=6537BBE4

They became one of the country’s most popular female recording groups, collected 19 gold records, scores of Top 10 hits and dozens of movie credits during World War II, when the Andrews Sisters were the singing sweethearts of American GIs at war bond rallies, battlefield hospitals and USO performances. Of the three sisters--none of whom knew how to read music--it was Maxene, the vivacious soprano, who reinvented her career many times over, surviving the advent of rock ‘n’ roll and continuing to perform up until her death, even after a near-fatal heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery in the mid-1980s. Andrews’ career included success as a soloist after the 1967 death of one sister, La Verne, and a falling out with Patty. But Andrews did not limit herself to performing. She spent several years as a drama instructor and top administrator at Paradise College in Lake Tahoe and enjoyed modest success as the author of a book called “Over Here, Over Here,” about the performers of the war years. Shortly after La Verne’s death from cancer in 1967, the Andrews Sisters act broke up and Maxene spent a few years in academia in Lake Tahoe, which she later told Billboard magazine was the “biggest kick I’ve ever had.” But a strange twist brought the two surviving sisters back to public attention, and a new generation of fans: the 1973 release of Bette Midler’s version of “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.” The following year, the Andrews Sisters, minus one, were again the rage, starring in a hit musical, “Over Here,” which ran for a year at Broadway’s Shubert Theater. It was to be the last joint performance for the two sisters, who had a falling-out that industry insiders say had to do with a conflict between Maxene and Patty’s husband, Walter Weschler, the group’s conductor and arranger. According to published reports, the sisters, despite being longtime neighbors in Encino, had only seen each other twice since 1974--once at Maxene’s bedside after her 1982 heart attack, and again at the 1987 dedication of their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1989, Maxene Andrews moved from Encino to Auburn, Calif., near Sacramento. Past 60 years of age, Maxene Andrews embarked on a solo career. She was sidelined by a heart attack at 66, but was back on stage a few months later, rehearsing strapped to a heart monitor. She showed an indomitable will, performing five weeks after heart bypass surgery. In 1990, Andrews released her only solo album, called “Maxene: An Andrews Sister.” A year later, her music was brought to life on the stage of the Kennedy Center in Washington, in a ballet choreographed by Paul Taylor and set to nine Andrews Sisters songs. Maxene's remains are interred with her sister, LaVerne, at [Forest Lawn Cemetery, Glendale, CA](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Forest-Lawn-Cemetery-Glendale-CA/216469575057692)",,132,"{'like_count': 97, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 31029}",Famous Graves Group,,2023-10-21 15:31:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/400403136_6762607857155525_496529588680861975_n.jpg?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=j9oCVBwqgQIAX-knHaO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCqbYBySFZVVba_9KnigsJmVKH5kczES0FrAbHUvepKCw&oe=655AF624,https://www.facebook.com/groups/449400928811331/permalink/1784967638587980,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394554112_10159868049410878_1644795639931981287_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=c7RCGTqI57YAX9A4um-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCgFRKGUtKYL5MHsOhG8_h1MA2cDaDjqVkBARHIj05zBQ&oe=6559ADD2

facebook,"HOW WILL WE BE THE BEINGS OF THE NEW WORLD? (Read if resonates with you) All beings will have their Body of Light, since their lives will flow through it, without the mental and astral conflicts of the average man of the current time. Whoever has his Light Body active will be clear and transparent for his brothers, and will see his peers in the same way. The lies and falsehood will have ended and will be part of a gloomy past now overcome. Life in a civilization made up of human beings in their Light Bodies will be a healthy, natural, friendly and luminous life in all aspects: educational, social, political, and in the fields of science and art. Everything will be done with clear and healthy intentions of benefit for everyone, for the “being-community”, since ‘ego-ism’ will no longer exist, and the multiple spheres of separateness will have ended. The social order will be harmonious; each family will educate its own children; They will have all the time to do it in peace and with love, since materialistic ambitions will have given way to enjoying the Present, the simple, the children, the daily chores. There will also be a harmonious time for the development of the internal potentialities of beings, but all this without ever interfering with the harmony of the common Good, but, on the contrary, the development of such faculties will be placed, in due time, in function of the Common benefit. The Light Body will be the vehicle for the expression of “LIGHT”, “PEACE” and “LOVE”, concentric 'Three Suns' that will be the qualities that will flow from this Solar Vehicle towards each activity, in each relationship and towards the world. The negative, dense, “heavy” mental-astral forms that exist around the planet today will no longer exist, because after the great Planetary Purification the environment will be clean and the Men of the New Race will no longer be able to create harmful mental forms; All your thoughts will be harmonious and beneficial, of peace and brotherhood. All creations will be like crystal clear water flowing through the bed of a beautiful stream. This will be the “mental channels” of the flowing crystalline thoughts that will flow from the New Men, in that future next Race. There will be challenges..., yes; but they will be of another nature, of another category, always linked to creative development and innate internal faculties not yet explored. There will be opportunities for development in all areas of life and “the conflict of time”, which seems to be a problem of modern man, will no longer exist, because in the New Race there will be time for everything that the heart feels like doing, because everything will be harmoniously and naturally arranged for the Path that each being feels as their own, and also, because the psychological trap of 'linear time' will no longer deceive men, who in the eternity of the NOW will live in peace and harmony.

facebook,"Resolving Conflict October 22, 2023 Twenty-Ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time (Year A) The Pharisees went off and plotted how they might entrap him in speech. They sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. And you are not concerned with anyone’s opinion, for you do not regard a person’s status. Tell us, then, what is your opinion: Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?” Matthew 22:15–17 It has been said that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” In other words, two people who are enemies with each other will often join together if they see an opportunity to jointly attack an even greater enemy. This is what was happening in today’s Gospel. Jesus was considered the greatest enemy of the Pharisees and the Herodians, and both of these groups joined together in a plot to trap Jesus even though they greatly disliked each other. The Pharisees were very nationalistic and were strict observers of the Law of Moses. It was their view that the people should not have to pay taxes to the Romans, and many of the people agreed. The Herodians supported the Romans and, therefore, were supporters of Herod, the Jewish ruler appointed by the Roman Emperor. One of Herod’s responsibilities was to obtain taxes from the Jews for use by the Roman government. Those who opposed the paying of taxes to the Romans could even be put to death. This joint questioning of Jesus had one goal: to get Him in trouble. If Jesus said it was unlawful to pay taxes to Caesar, Herod’s soldiers could arrest Him. If Jesus said that the people should pay taxes to Caesar, the Pharisees could turn the people against Him. It appeared to be a lose-lose question posed to Jesus. Of course, Jesus’ answer was perfect. Without violating the Law of God, He also refrained from violating the civil law. Upon hearing His answer, all who heard Him “were amazed, and leaving him they went away.” The lesson learned from this passage is an especially important lesson to apply to family life. It is very common for conflicts to arise from time to time among those who are close to each other. When that happens, we can often take the approach of trying to trap the other person and trip them up with our deceptive reasoning. When this happens between two people, the conversation often turns into a shouting match with each party seeking only to find fault with the other. The solution to such situations is simple. Every conflict must be resolved by the truth. Jesus did this perfectly. He did not attack when He was attacked. He did not defend Himself irrationally. He did not shy away from the confrontation. He did not manipulate the truth to His own advantage. Instead, He spoke openly and honestly the full truth and refused to engage his opponents in their trickery. Consider this question. What if you were in Jesus’ position and the Pharisees came to you, asking you this question? What would you be tempted to answer? Most likely, you would try to answer them in such a way that appeased them. You might whisper, “We shouldn’t pay the taxes but don’t tell that to the Herodians.” And if the Herodians were to ask you that question, you might be tempted to give a different answer that appeased them. Oftentimes, when we feel as though another person is trying to trap us, condemn us, or challenge us, we become more concerned about our defense than with the honest truth. We can become afraid to say anything that will give them reason to attack us. We will be tempted to twist our answers rather than speak forthrightly with sincerity and honesty. This will never resolve a conflict. The only way to resolve anything is with the truth. Reflect, today, upon how you work to resolve conflict when it arises. Are you more like the Pharisees and Herodians whose only goal was to trick, trap and win? Do you see the other as an enemy in those moments? Or do you strive to be like Jesus who didn’t shy away from the conversation, answering honestly and directly? Of course, the truth was easy for Jesus since He was without any fault. In our lives, the truth may require that we admit our sin and apologize when confronted. However, if the truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth is our goal, then our conversations will imitate Jesus and, most often, a peaceful resolution will ensue. My truthful Lord, Your wisdom is perfect and Your words are truth. Please give me the gifts of wisdom and all truth, especially when conflicts arise. In those moments, please keep me from reacting in an angry and defensive way so that I can always be an instrument of the unity You desire.

facebook,"Top Female CPP-NPA Leader Yields to 8th Infantry Battalion in Bukidnon IMPASUGONG, Bukidnon - Top New People's Army (NPA) Leader identified as Chrislyn Mission Balamad @June/lsing/Ka-Nur/Al operating in Western Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental and Lanao area surrendered to 8th Infantry (DEPENDABLE) Battalion under the operational control of 403rd Infantry (PEACEMAKER) Brigade on September 29, 2023. Chrislyn Mission Balamad is the Secretary of Sub-Regional Committee - V (SRC-5), under the North Central Mindanao Regional Committee (NCMRC). She is 30 years old and has spent almost 12 years in the Communist Terrorist Group (CTG). The surrenderer revealed that she was only 18 and about to graduate from college when she was recruited at Mindanao State University (Main Campus) in Marawi City to join the CTG. According to her, she was an active member of the League of Filipino Students (LFS) at the university when she was convinced by their leaders to carry arms and participate in the terrorist movement attempting to overthrow the democratic government of the Philippines. Aforementioned surrenderee further revealed that the morale of the hierarchy of both party committee and operational command of the CTG went very low because of the mass surrender within their ranks due to the implementation of Support to Barangay Development Program (SBDP) of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). The relentless Focus Military Operation dislocated their disposition which according to her destroyed her unit which contributed much to her decision to surrender to the government forces. She also added that she plans to finish her baccalaureate degree, pursue to earn Juris Doctor and dreaming to be a lawyer in the near future. The surrender of Chrislyn Balamad also paved way to the surrender of her party husband Ryan Sagubay Daluniag @Kiram/Meka/Gom/Adong/Wewe/Tuyang, Commanding Officer, Sub-Regional Operations Command (SROC) and 1st Deputy Secretary of the SRC-5 on October 08, 2023 to 5IB, 1ID, PA through the negotiation efforts of the 8th Infantry Battalion, 4th Infantry (DIAMOND) Division, Philippine Army. ""The ranks within the Communist Terrorist Group is rapidly falling as surrenderees continue to flood not only our Brigade but in almost all of the Philippine Army units all over the archipelago. This is the result of our whole-of-nation approach as fighting insurgency and terrorism indeed is not only our job but of every Filipino. Let's continue the unity as the CTG is nearing to its end,” says Brigadier General Michele B Anayron Jr., the Brigade Commander of 403rd Infantry Brigade. #EndLocalCommunistArmedConflict #AFPyoucanTRUST #YourDependablePartner",,123,"{'like_count': 74, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 101138}","8th Infantry ""Dependable"" Battalion, Philippine Army",,2023-10-21 00:58:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/337078255_709397454308901_1283296935570715947_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=INRveA891RsAX9stTI8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCiGrD9qfCTQa9f2Y03k0nnXvHCvgzEBDR_22MkcRD0Wg&oe=655B3D6C,https://www.facebook.com/100064713129726/posts/714466514053780,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393857414_714464520720646_6253869983423942236_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=n5t7dR6f1b8AX_6Qpk1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBOrne6LXU4eDrBm1vZm5tbqLg0ztn2CVNCLhZ6KG82dw&oe=6538B684

facebook,"Sinn Féin: Palestinian Resistance? Dialogue! Mainstream political parties across Ireland have roundly condemned the actions of Palestinian resistance groups in recent weeks as they sought to rid their land of an illegal occupation. Significantly, Sinn Féin joined this chorus of condemnation, lest they offend their strategic partners in the US and elsewhere. Notably, Sinn Féin speakers who have supported this narrative have been rightly booed as a result when they took to podiums, particularly in Belfast, where at Belfast City Hall Pat Sheehan 'MLA' received such a negative reaction from the gathered masses. Much of their rhetoric has centred around demands for a two state solution, a solution which would ensure the continued Zionist presence in the region, the continued oppression of the Palestinian people and the ongoing occupation of their land. More significantly, the stance of Sinn Féin has notably changed from their past position on Palestine. Previously, clear public support for Palestinian resistance was notable among the rank and file. Now, even calls for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador to Ireland have been deleted and removed from social media accounts of big players within Sinn Féin, most notably, Chris Hazzard 'MP'. It is abundantly clear that as pro-Palestine campaigners within Sinn Féin have set their stall out during the current crisis, there has been a major internal re-adjustment of the party's position on Palestine. Even calls from Ógra Shinn Féin, Sinn Féin’s youth wing, to expel the Israeli ambassador was too much for them. Sinn Féin’s new position is no longer 'resist the occupation' but 'dialogue'. The political equivalent of asking the abused to sit down with the abuser but where the abuser is using every means at their disposal to let the world know that it is their right to be abusive. More Palestinians have died in the past two weeks than died here in Ireland during thirty years of conflict; the extreme majority as a result of airstrikes in residential areas. Let that sink in. What is happening in Palestine now with the collective punishment of the population is a clear case of genocide and ethnic cleansing on the part of the Israeli regime. In the 1940s, the Jewish population of Europe was rounded up and placed in camps, where they were systematically exterminated and removed from the land. Jewish partisan groups became a safe haven for the persecuted. It is estimated that 30,000 of them organised and fought back against Fascism, and rightly so. If Irish Republicans at the time had called for 'dialogue' they'd have been roundly condemned by all. So remember, the next time someone breaks into your home, kills one of your children, shackles the other, and forces you to live in the shed at the end of the garden, don't fight back.

facebook,"PRESS RELEASE | October 20, 2023 ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT MUST RECOGNIZE THE TERRITORIAL RIGHTS OF ERITREAN AFAR NATION TO ACCESS THE PORT OF ASSAB In his televised address to members of the parliament of Ethiopia, the House of People’s Representatives in Addis Ababa on Oct 13th, PM Abiy argued access to the Red Sea is crucial for Ethiopia’s growth and Ethiopia’s lack of access to the Red Sea is a potential source of conflict. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy presented the argument to Ethiopia's lawmakers that Ethiopia has an inalienable right to access the Red Sea waters, and that denial of access would be against Ethiopia's national interest. The PM also alluded to Ethiopia’s glorious past and ownership of the Port of Assab throughout history, the country is under great pressure to accommodate the fast-growing population and if the economic aspirations are unattainable, it will be a matter of time Ethiopia could be forced into another conflict over the Red Sea. As the indigenous nation of Eritrea, we would like to remind the PM of Ethiopia, Mr. Abiy, that the coastal territories, sea waters and natural resources of Dankalia, including the Port of Assab is a legal and traditional property of indigenous Afar of Eritrea. The current Eritrean regime has colonized the traditional Afar territories in the southern Red Sea coast of Eritrea using genocidal policies, violence, ethnic cleansing, uncompensated evictions and various illegal land expropriations which have resulted in the displacement of tens of thousands of Afar from their land and territories in Eritrea. In the years since Eritrea became an independent nation, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea (COI) and other UN Special Reporters have repeatedly condemned persecution and crimes against humanity against the Eritrean Afar. UN SR May 2023 Report For Ethiopia, obtaining the Port of Assab unilaterally or making a deal with the current Eritrean leaders (PFDJ) would constitute a significant violation of international law and in violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Eritrea as well as against the aspiration of the Eritrean Afar nation to self-determination in Dankalia and political autonomy in Eritrea. Eritrea's current regime and Isaias Afwerki are responsible for much of regional instability, human rights abuses and obstacles to people-to-people relations and socioeconomic development. Organizing an effective consultation and collaborative effort between Ethiopia and the Eritrean Afar National Congress (EANC) and democratic Eritrean opposition groups is imperative in order to expedite the removal of the cancerous regime led by Isaias Afwerki in Asmara. This could lead to economic cooperation and other common interests that will benefit Ethiopians, Eritreans, and the entire Horn of Africa region. GICLO BISOH!

facebook,"Confirmation of our interpretation of salt as Eros (i.e., as a feeling relationship) is found in the fact that the bitterness is the origin of the colours (feelings). Disappointment, always a shock to the feelings, is not only the mother of bitterness but the strongest incentive to a differentiation of feeling. The failure of a pet plan, the disappointing behaviour of someone one loves, can supply the impulse either for a more or less brutal outburst of affect or for a modification and adjustment of feeling, and hence for its higher development. This culminates in wisdom if feeling is supplemented by reflection and rational insight. Wisdom is never violent: where wisdom reigns there is no conflict between thinking and feeling. - CARL JUNG Food for thought....",,120,"{'like_count': 63, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 90114}",Analytical Psychology: Theory and Practice,,2023-10-21 13:22:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/295746161_580622230422898_7672749045740872475_n.jpg?stp=c0.14.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=wjs7PjpoqLkAX9dOewq&_nc_oc=AQm8_EB0NtlSY3RNo5Xh9-G0O2LWvvMLUlypRTrHx-8WqkJQsbJ72vc618fNwipGZig&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfArJ4XtwW7q_wzjnFDpOEzWy2waEYES5JPuqP3Iil5xkA&oe=6559FC72,https://www.facebook.com/groups/309050616982953/permalink/1050085999546074,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394535383_24008700975442875_5759740982171604399_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=0LVfrQFp6LkAX8kYnId&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCTHM1TzSsf6ESkTL-z19TaebUE_wxH3ezEg8zdrOMDaQ&oe=65393AEE

Still can't believe that so many people around the world are under a cloud of such wrong information. Can't believe that there are still people in the world who justify the unimaginable that our enemy has committed, is committing and will continue to commit. Now, the war on digital and the information system is just as important as any other action designed to support the actions of our army and support Israelis in Israel and around the world. The situation is unequivocal: effective and accurate information will prevent the death of Israelis and Jews in Israel and around the world and it is important for us to show the world that even the smallest support for the actions of Hamas means support for anti-Semitism, for Nazis, for actions worse than those that shocked the world ISIS. How do you do that? We established a civil advocacy system with the best campaigners and advertisers in Israel under one goal - to use every shekel we have to promote advocacy on the various digital networks.

facebook,"**APEL LA BOICOTAREA DE CĂTRE MILITARI ȘI POLIȚIȘTI, A PREZENȚEI POLITICIENILOR LA FESTIVITĂȚILE ORGANIZATE DE ZIUA ARMATEI (25 OCTOMBRIE)!** Se apropie 25 Octombrie, Ziua Armatei. Sunt vreo 60 de asociații și organizații diverse care reunesc militari și polițiști în rezervă și în retragere. Ocazia este mai mult decât perfectă pentru a exprima nemulțumirile militarilor față de clasa politică. Cum? Bineînțeles că există o multitudine de variante. Sugerez una foarte simplă, dar care va produce precis efecte. **Și anume, ca reprezentanții asociațiilor să depună coroanele omagiale înainte de sosirea *politrucilor* diverși și să părăsească locațiile pentru ceremonii, exact în momentul în care aceștia își încep discursurile în care *mint *oricum că respectă armata. Pot fi și alte variante, ideea principală fiind ca militarii și polițiștii să transmită politicienilor un semnal clar asupra faptului că politicienii au intrat în conflict cu armata! **Există și un element ajutător care va amplifica efectul și care va deveni cu siguranță util în a crea o vizibilitate maximă privind nemulțumirile militarilor, mai ales în condițiile în care doar o mică parte din asociații participă cu reprezentanți la activitățile omagiale. Elementul de efect este acela ca **asociațiile să înștiințeze în prealabil instituțiile politice ***(primării, prefecturi, partide, în București - președinția, cei 2 președinți ai camerelor, ș.a.m.d.), *cu mediatizare publică (în presă și pe rețelele de socializare), asupra faptului că militarii din asociația ""X"", nu vor participa alături de reprezentanții politici la ceremoniile organizate de Ziua Armatei, în semn de protest față de desconsiderarea militarilor manifestată de către clasa politică *(dovedită prin diverse acte nomative discriminatorii și cu tente vădite de persecuție politică îndreptate contra intereselor militarilor).* În cazul activităților din Mun. București, notificările trebuie să vizeze și pe reprezentanții C.C.R. și ai Î.C.C.J. și C.S.M. - și care de Ziua Armatei, de câțiva ani sunt prezenți și aceștia în tribunale oficiale - așteptând ca armata să le prezinte onorul! Nu este complicat și nu necesită mult timp! Vă dați seama ce *fețe* își vor trage cei 2 președinți ai Parlamentului sau primărița de la Craiova sau președintele C.C.R. - când vor primi înștiințări că nu sunt bineveniți printre militari la omagierea Zilei Armatei! În același timp, pot fi notificați despre ***boicot*** și marionetele din conducerile militare ale ministerelor (serviciilor). Și care oricum nu mai au nicio demnitate de mult timp, din moment ce nu au absolut nicio poziție contra loviturilor încasate de la politicieni de către militarii și polițiștii pensionați! Bineînțeles că ***sforarii*** de la asociații vor cleveti ca de obicei, cum că nu este momentul, că nu ar fi demn ș.a.m.d. Ce facem cu ei? Îi ignorăm, îi înlocuim și gata! În condițiile în care de ani de zile, acești ***sforari ***depun coroane de Ziua Armatei încolonați spășit înapoia politicienilor care lovesc în armată. Sunt aceiași ***sforari*** care după defilare, mai mânâncă fericiți și o *fasole *cu cârnați alături de politicieni și mai beau și un vin alături de aceștia. ***Așteptăm materializarea! Liderii A.N.C.M.R.R. și din cadrul M.Ap.N. și din cadrul M.A.I.! Dvs. conduceți cele mai mai asociații de militari și polițiști în rezervă/în retragere!

facebook,"THEOLOGY OF THE BODY SUMMARY: Dr. Lauri Przybysz, Archdiocese of Baltimore 2014 Theology of the Body is the topic of a series of 129 lectures given by Pope John Paul II during his Wednesday audiences in St. Peter's Square and Paul VI Audience Hall between September 1979 and November 1984. It was the first major teaching of his pontificate. The complete addresses were later compiled and expanded upon in many of John Paul's encyclicals, letters, and exhortations. These talks became known as “The Theology of the Body” and have had a growing impact on Christian thinking about what it means to be embodied as male or female. JPII summed up his series of catechesis “under the title: ""Human love in the divine plan,"" or more precisely, ""The redemption of the body and the sacramentality of marriage."" In his talks, JPII explored the biblical teaching and the meaning of the sacrament of marriage in light of Christ’s redemptive grace. ▪Dignity of the Human Person. Reflecting on the Genesis accounts of creation, Pope John Paul II underscored the way in which the body reflects or expresses the person. The human person discovers his dignity through his body and its capacity to express his ability to think and to choose, unlike the animals, who lack this ability. (See Genesis 2:19-21.) ▪Partnership of Man and Woman. Yet humanity is radically lacking in its expression in only one sex. The full meaning of the body and hence the human person is revealed only when the man stands over against another unique way of being human–woman. ▪Covenant of marriage. The doctrine of “Theology of the Body” is organically related to both the sacramentality of marriage, contained in Humanae Vitae, Paul VI and confirmed in JPII’s Apostolic Exhortation Familiaris Consortio, fruit of the 1980 Synod of Bishops on ""The Role of the Christian Family,"" ▪Humans “speak” with their bodies – truth or falsehood. This distinctive way of being a person and a gift for others, male and female, reflects what the late pope called “the nuptial meaning of the body.” Coming together in the profound partnership of marriage, man and woman live for the other in mutual love and deference. ▪Marital Intercourse as Total Self Gift. This union is expressed concretely in the couple’s bodily gift of themselves to one another in sexual intercourse. Here they speak a profound language of total self-gift and unconditional fidelity. ▪Sin breaks relationships. The late pope understood the impact of sin on the human person. The Fall brings about a series of ruptures within the person, radically diminishing the body’s capacity to express reason and freedom. It introduces alienation and a struggle for control into the relationship of male and female, distorting their relationships in marriage and in human society (cf. Genesis 3:16). And it devastates the human sexual drive, redirecting it from an impulse toward life-giving interpersonal union between covenantal partners to a desire to use and exploit others for personal satisfaction. ▪Healing through Christ’s Grace. Yet with the death and resurrection of Christ, sin does not have the last word on the condition of the body. The grace that flows from the cross and resurrection effects a “redemption of the body,” not just in heaven but here and now. Through the healing effects of Christian prayer and sacramental worship, the body is enabled to express the person and his or her ability to think and freely choose. ▪The grace of Christ also enables men and women to overcome their mutual conflict and live together in marriage in the exercise of “mutual submission out of reverence for Christ” (cf. Ephesians 5:21; Mulieris Dignitatem, no. 24). This transforming grace enables the body in its maleness and femaleness to be offered as the expression of the “sincere gift of self” in a way reflective of the person’s vocation– as single, married, or a consecrated celibate. ▪Humans created for a purpose. The human person as a unique embodied subject is thus understood through the three panels (or triptych) of the Christian mysteries of creation, sin, and redemption. The result is what John Paul II himself modestly referred to as an “adequate” understanding of the person. ▪Sexuality is Good. This vision enables us to recognize and affirm that the body and the gift of sexuality are good. At the same time it highlights why this gift is falsified by extramarital or contraceptive sex that sever sexual union from its inherent meanings of unconditional fidelity and life-giving fruitfulness. Sexuality is a part of who we are as men and women. Our sexuality is the natural and God-given drive in each person that seeks relationship with other people. We are called to witness to Christian values in every relationship in our lives. Inappropriate sexual activity is “not telling the truth” with our bodies. Modesty is related to chastity because it is about appropriate behavior. Acting and dressing modestly respects other people by refraining from (truncated)",,112,"{'like_count': 54, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 371404}",CATECHISM OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH,,2023-10-21 23:21:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394555933_1066851027646987_1759526821668243739_n.jpg?stp=c0.3.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bb4UQsz1OBYAX_WWYiw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBZBXNH3xUrLvZPbQwYuk9czKZmbX2vNP0gkxUOkY1iXg&oe=655B822B,https://www.facebook.com/groups/425055381680083/permalink/1501320014053609,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394829386_1067111217620968_3532725006706991517_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=sUwQZT-e8iwAX_OgNLR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDUtsBz_aGwwubCrLzNm_tVyXlxkllmPhVg2uRlMYNwiA&oe=653A53CD

facebook,"General Hospital Recap: Friday, October 20 – Esme Bans Spencer from Ace’s Doctor Appointment – Drew Shuts Out Carly In the latest General Hospital episode on Friday, October 20, we witnessed an array of events that unfolded, impacting key characters and relationships in Port Charles. The show's distinctive style and tone continue to captivate viewers, providing a glimpse into the lives of the Cassadine family and their intricate connections. Laura's Heartfelt Reunion with Charlotte The episode began with a heartfelt reunion between Laura Collins (Genie Francis) and Charlotte Cassadine (Scarlett Fernandez). Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart) surprised Charlotte by bringing her home from school, offering Laura an opportunity to reconnect with the young Cassadine. During their conversation, Laura recognized Charlotte's feelings of isolation and alienation at school. Laura, drawing from her own teenage experiences, acknowledged her own past mistakes, which seemed to resonate with Charlotte. While it appeared that Charlotte was on the verge of a confession, she ultimately admitted that she missed Laura and was thrilled to have her back in her life. Anna and Valentin's Discussion At the Metro Court, Valentin engaged in a conversation with Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). Anna expressed her concerns and the sense of vulnerability she felt while awaiting a potential attack from her adversaries. Valentin suggested that Anna could stay with friends to avoid being alone in her suite, but Anna declined, unwilling to endanger others due to her troubled past. Valentin emphasized that this vendetta stemmed from Victor Cassadine's will reading, hinting at a more significant conspiracy against Anna. The tension in this relationship continues to grow, with Victor's shadow looming over their lives. Alexis's Bold Move Over at The Invader, Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn) confronted Judge Albert Kim (Kurt Yue) with evidence of his connection to Asher Alexander, a billionaire investment banker. Alexis raised concerns about Judge Kim's alleged failure to report certain trips and gifts on his taxes, insinuating a potential conflict of interest that could tarnish his career. In a bold move, Alexis offered to make these allegations disappear in exchange for commuting Drew Cain's (Cameron Mathison) sentence to time served. Judge Kim expressed outrage at this blatant blackmail and threatened consequences for Alexis. Despite the risks, Alexis remained resolute in her pursuit of justice, highlighting her unwavering determination and love for the law. Spencer's Struggles with Parental Rights At General Hospital, Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) expressed frustration at being excluded from his nephew Ace's (Jay and Joey Clay) life. Esme Prince (Avery Pohl) managed to secure an appointment with Ace's pediatrician and went alone to the examination. This situation raised questions about Spencer's role in Ace's life, as Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom) explained the assertion of parental rights. Despite the challenging circumstances, Spencer remained determined to maintain his presence in Ace's life, setting the stage for further family drama within the Cassadine clan. Drew's Heartbreaking Farewell Meanwhile, in the hospital, Elizabeth Baldwin (Rebecca Herbst) shared a poignant moment with Drew Cain. Elizabeth explored potential avenues to delay Drew's return to Pentonville, but Drew, resigned to his fate, declined her efforts. The emotional farewell was a reminder of the sacrifices made by characters on the show, leaving a lasting impact on viewers. As guards led Drew away in shackles, the emotional weight of the situation underscored the challenges faced by characters in General Hospital. Cody's Complicated Confession In a café, Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) and Cody Bell (Josh Kelly) discussed the complications arising from Cody's confession about his paternity. Dante offered advice on the importance of honesty, but Cody found it difficult to reveal the truth to Mac Scorpio (John J. York). Their conversation highlighted the complexities of relationships in Port Charles and the potential repercussions of keeping secrets. Robert's Pursuit of Romance At a yoga studio, Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) expressed his desire for a romantic relationship with Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennesy). However, Diane insisted on a fresh start and maintained her boundaries. Their interactions suggest that a complicated chess game of emotions is in play, with Robert needing to tread carefully to win Diane's heart. General Hospital continues to deliver compelling narratives and character developments that keep fans engaged and eager to see how these intricate storylines unfold. Stay tuned for more updates on the challenges, secrets, and relationships that define life in Port Charles.",,111,"{'like_count': 92, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 37700}",Heartbeat of Port Charles,,2023-10-21 03:00:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/368631253_636687715228754_1771441978155825255_n.jpg?stp=c9.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cffGdHP4hCUAX8pDA8j&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDU-KRhViIuKkHuXvGLcYkE_bxmjb8A1tJz7mwMh4HmMw&oe=655AE651,https://www.facebook.com/100066625927025/posts/669287228635469,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393800156_669287195302139_4402076896643314409_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GL4ZCVIg8a4AX8TQ_-l&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB9PY7DYWpJva2QrmSLrO6ARKmcWzRV3Qi1aujwKV47fg&oe=65384F7B
facebook,"Death toll in Gaza Strip 84% higher than 50-day conflict in 2014: UN report‼️ The number of people killed in Gaza since Oct. 7 is 84% higher than the total number of Palestinians killed in the 50-day conflict in 2014, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said on Friday, Anadolu Agency reports. In its report, titled Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel, released on Friday, UNOCHA citing the Health Ministry in Gaza, said since the start of the conflict on Oct. 7, 4,137 people have been killed in Gaza, which is 84% higher than the 2,251 Palestinians who died in the 50-day conflict in 2014. As hostilities entered the 14th day in Gaza, an additional 352 Palestinians were killed in the past 24 hours, with children and women making up 60% of the casualties. “About 1.4 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) are estimated in Gaza, with more than 544,000 sheltering in 147 the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) -designated emergency shelters (DES) in increasingly dire conditions,” it said. The report revealed that 30% of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged. Citing the Ministry of Public Works in Gaza, it noted the “destruction of 12,845 housing units and the rendering of 9,055 housing units uninhabitable, as of 18 October. Another 121,000 housing units are said to have suffered minor to moderate damage.” The report, citing Israeli authorities, stated that at least 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, with the majority of casualties occurring on Oct.7. It was also mentioned that at least 201 people have been held captive in Gaza, including Israelis and foreign nationals, as per Israeli estimates, with two hostages released by Hamas. Hamas’s armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, earlier announced the release of the two hostages “for humanitarian reasons” following mediation by Qatar. Israeli sources also confirmed their release. The conflict in Gaza, under Israeli bombardment and blockade since Oct. 7, began when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, a multi-pronged surprise attack that included a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel by land, sea, and air. It said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers. The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231021-death-toll-in-gaza-strip-84-higher-than-50-day-conflict-in-2014-un-report/",,111,"{'like_count': 21, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 55247}","Jerusalem ""Al-Quds"" is the Capital of Palestine",,2023-10-21 20:29:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312527672_484986470335695_4514270114700884458_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8UHp-40wnjMAX_Hovot&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmz2zrXECPUkrs4DgvQ_IuMGyvRfV0_xvMpvty9lpBLg&oe=655A118F,https://www.facebook.com/100064730374657/posts/727056159462057,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393811590_727056082795398_4623531421485491035_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=21iveqlJiusAX9Cven_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCz9KM1aV7ScQh07lPiq47XGLpMmOyGsPGiGpQrSPa1IA&oe=653951C7

facebook,"Israeli occupation authority threatens to bomb Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza: Palestinian Red Crescent‼️ The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) on Friday said Israeli forces threatened to bomb the Al-Quds Hospital in the Gaza Strip, which is sheltering thousands of displaced women and children. As many as “12,000 displaced people, including 70% children and women, are in imminent danger after Israeli forces threatened to bomb Al-Quds Hospital and demanded evacuation,” the humanitarian organization said on X. “This place could turn to ashes if those threats are carried out.” “Is there a world power capable of stopping the threats of the Israeli occupation army to bomb hospitals with innocent civilians inside?” the PRCS said. It called on the international community to “act urgently” to avert “another catastrophe like Al-Ahli Hospital.” At least 471 people were killed and many others injured in the Israeli airstrike on Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital earlier this week, according to health officials in Gaza. Israel, however, denied responsibility for the air raid. The ongoing deadly conflict began Oct. 7 when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood — a multi-pronged surprise attack that included a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel by land, sea and air. Hamas said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers. The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. In addition to launching a sweeping bombardment campaign ahead of an expected ground invasion, Israel ordered a “full siege” on Gaza that has led to electricity supplies being severed as water, food, fuel and medical supplies run out. https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231020-israel-threatens-to-bomb-al-quds-hospital-in-gaza-palestinian-red-crescent/",,109,"{'like_count': 31, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 55247}","Jerusalem ""Al-Quds"" is the Capital of Palestine",,2023-10-21 01:55:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312527672_484986470335695_4514270114700884458_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8UHp-40wnjMAX_Hovot&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmz2zrXECPUkrs4DgvQ_IuMGyvRfV0_xvMpvty9lpBLg&oe=655A118F,https://www.facebook.com/100064730374657/posts/726604989507174,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393793573_726604922840514_8522871961432521389_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nIQJVOEiDYQAX-pXdwq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCrnw5rof82ryhy6xS7L0ZEmx5dhN1-erZsCw3w6UxhMg&oe=654F91AB
facebook,"The Palestinian Red Crescent is demanding the reopening of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The crucial lifeline was shut after an initial aid convoy of 20 trucks rolled through on Saturday. Even before the Israel-Hamas conflict began on Oct. 7, most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people depended on aid. More than 400 aid trucks brought supplies each day. About 1 million Gazans have been displaced by the conflict. Dozens of cargo vehicles are on the Egyptian side of the border waiting for the crossing to reopen.

facebook,"A first, but limited, shipment of life-saving humanitarian supplies from the United Nations and the Egyptian Red Crescent entered Gaza today on 20 trucks, passing through the Rafah Crossing. It will provide an urgently needed lifeline to some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians, mostly women and children, who have been cut off from water, food, medicine, fuel and other essentials. But it is only a small beginning and far from enough. More than 1.6 million people in Gaza are in critical need of humanitarian aid. Children, pregnant women and the elderly remain the most vulnerable. Nearly half of Gaza’s population are children. With so much civilian infrastructure in Gaza damaged or destroyed in nearly two weeks of constant bombings, including shelters, health facilities, water, sanitation, and electrical systems, time is running out before mortality rates could skyrocket due to disease outbreaks and lack of health-care capacity. Hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties. Civilians face mounting challenges in accessing essential food supplies. Health facilities no longer have fuel and are running on small amounts they have secured locally. These are expected to run out in the next day or so. Water production capacity is at 5 per cent of normal levels. Pre-positioned humanitarian supplies have already been depleted. Vulnerable people are at greatest risk and children are dying at an alarming rate and being denied their right to protection, food, water and health care. Nearly one-third of the population of Palestine was food insecure before this conflict in Gaza. Today stocks in shops are nearly exhausted and bakeries are closing, while tens of thousands of people are displaced and unable to cook or safely purchase food. We call for a humanitarian ceasefire, along with immediate, unrestricted humanitarian access throughout Gaza to allow humanitarian actors to reach civilians in need, save lives and prevent further human suffering. Flows of humanitarian aid must be at scale and sustained, and allow all Gazans to preserve their dignity. We call for safe and sustained access to water, food, health – including sexual and reproductive health – and fuel, which is necessary to enable essential services. We call for the protection of all civilians and civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including health-care facilities. We call for the protection of humanitarian workers in Gaza who are risking their lives in the service of others. And we call for the utmost respect of international humanitarian law by all parties. Gaza was a desperate humanitarian situation before the most recent hostilities. It is now catastrophic. The world must do more.

facebook,"How To Help Palestine Palestine has been under Israeli occupation for decades, resulting in a severe system of oppression, apartheid and humanitarian crisis. The occupation has led to the death and injury of millions of Palestinians, displacement of millions of Palestinians, and the situation remains dire for those who are still living in the Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. During this period of heightened levels of violence and hardship on the Palestinians, MPAC recommend the following as ways you can be of help: Educate Yourself - The first step toward taking meaningful action to help Palestine is to educate yourself about the conflict and its root causes. Research and read about the history of the conflict, the current political situation, and the various cases of human rights abuse that have taken place. This will give you a better understanding of the issues at hand and help you identify the most effective ways to help. Advocate for Change - Help Palestine by advocating for political change. Learn more about the Palestinian issue and lift up Palestinian voices. This can include writing to your elected representatives, signing petitions, organizing or joining protests and supporting political campaigns that call for end of occupation, promote peace and justice in the region. By using your voice to raise awareness about the issues facing Palestinians, you can help to bring about positive change. Stay Informed and Engaged - It's also essential to stay informed and engaged regarding the situation in Palestine today. Be careful about the sources you rely on for information as many mainstream media organizations are completely biased against the Palestinians and are in fact creating and spreading false stories and Israeli propaganda. Cross-check and double check information and be aware of the methods used by many mainstream media organizations to route sympathy away from the continue to advocate for change and take meaningful action to Israel’s government and businesses. Support Palestinian Businesses - Another important way to help Palestine is by supporting Palestinian businesses and boycotting Israeli businesses. BDS is one movement building an economic boycott of Israel and developing effective campaigns against companies that participate in Israel’s oppression of Palestinians. International companies aid and abet Israel’s violations of international law, including by operating in illegal Israeli settlements and acting as contractors for the Israeli military and government. Hold corporations accountable for their role in violating the rights of Palestinians. You can find information relating to Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) online. Donate to Reputable Organizations - One of the quickest and most impactful ways to help Palestine is by donating to reputable organizations that provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians.

facebook,"The saying ""A coffee will be remembered for 40 years""...

 Its real history is based on the story of Yusuf the Wise from Üsküdar and Greek fisherman Stelyo.

 1895 Eminönü Yemiş Pier, the Ottoman officer entering the fisherman's café says, ""-Brother Yusuf, I want a big cup of coffee from me for everyone, but not for the Greek palicarium sitting over there. Both my coffee and my silver coins are forbidden for him.""

 Yusuf offers coffee and puts one in front of Palikarya Stelyo. The officer literally roars

 ""Didn't I say that it was forbidden, Yusuf?""

 ..Wise Yusuf never loses his composure.."" - Commander says, ""That coffee is from me, it is halal for him too""..

 Stelyo looks at Yusuf with gratitude. It is 1905, the Greek rebellion begins in Samos. Damat Ferit Pasha sends soldiers to the island. Yusuf is also a soldier and is among the soldiers who land on the island.

 However, he is captured in the first conflict. He lies in the dungeons of Samos for 2 years. At the end of 2 years, Greek gangs put Yusuf up for sale in the slave market. At the auction, a voice is heard among the voices of 5 para - 7 para.

 - I'll give that Turk 5 kuruş, I'll take it immediately...""... Silence prevails, the Greek takes Yusuf to his car and takes him out of the village. He stops his car near the sea and turns to Yusuf;

 ""- You are free, Wise Yusuf,"" he says. Yusuf cannot believe the situation and falls into the hands of the Greek. ""- Sir, who are you, what kind of person are you, why do you set me free?"" he says.

 The Greek returns to Yusuf and says, ""I am the fisherman Stelyo."" Yusuf cannot solve the situation, he does not even recognize the man. The Greek tells a long story, returns to Yemiş Pier, 12 years ago, describes that day in detail and says, ""- Here I am, having a cup of coffee."" ""The fisherman you served coffee, Stelyo,"" he says.  Tears flood. Stelyo sends Yusuf to Istanbul illegally.

 This friendship continues for 35 years. They visit each other every year.

 A cup of coffee is a must with every visit.
 They tell their children and grandchildren about their friendship and say, ""This coffee will be remembered for 40 years.""

facebook,"My friends Jesus is coming, and many professing Christians are not ready. Many professing Christians are stuck in sin, lies, and have not truly repented. They are stuck in a church, listening to a pastor and NOT listening to Jesus, the only TRUE teacher we should all have. Are you learning from Jesus? Or are you learning from a pastor or preacher you like? I was talking to Jesus a week or two ago about what is happening in Israel. I asked Jesus how He views Israel. I asked Him what He thinks of them. I heard Jesus say to me 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem.' I knew what Jesus was talking about when I heard those words. In the gospels, Jesus speaks about Jerusalem. Jesus says 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem. How often I have LONGED to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks, but you were NOT WILLING.' My friends Jesus cares about Israel, and the people within it. However, Jesus made it clear in the gospels He cares for the gentiles as well. Because Jesus said if ANYONE obeys His words, Him and His Father will make their home in them. Do you have the Holy Spirit my friend? Or are you like many of those who deny Jesus as God? Are you like the modern day Jews? Or do you follow and obey Jesus? This war between Israel and Gaza is a war that is absent from the will of God. Murdering, rape, pillaging, causing much grieving and suffering. Jesus spoke about the destruction of Jerusalem when referring to the end of the world. Jesus said NOT ONE STONE will be left standing. EVERY ONE will be THROWN DOWN. Jerusalem and Israel will be destroyed. JUST as Jesus said they would be. Many people will take scriptures from the Old testament, and say God is still with Israel. My friends today's Israel and Jewish religious folk do NOT obey Jesus, and MANY deny Him as God and as being the Messiah. Jesus said that NOT ONE STONE will be left standing because you DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE TIME OF YOUR VISITATION. They did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, and Jesus' mighty hand of Judgement is coming upon Israel, and they will be destroyed. Are you like the modern day religious Jews who deny Jesus as the Messiah? Are you like many of those in Gaza who believe in the prophet Mohammad and NOT in Jesus? Who think Jesus is just a mere prophet and man of God? I want to testify to you friend, Jesus is God, and He will REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU if you ASK HIM. Jesus is the LIVING God, and He cares for even the unbeliever. Jesus brings rain on the just, and the unjust. My friends if you have not reconciled with, are getting to know Jesus PERSONALLY, learning from Him, hearing and knowing His voice, and OBEYING Him and following after Him EVERY DAY, you need to REPENT while you still can. WW3 is COMING my friends. So many wars, and many rumors of wars. This world is growing more and more dangerous. The seas and the waves roaring, signs in the heavens and on Earth. Do not ASSUME you are right with Jesus my friend, and ASK HIM. Many people are presumptuous and think they are right with Jesus, and that they are saved, and all good and on their way to heaven. I was talking to Jesus the other night, and He pointed out a woman to me. Jesus led me to share with her 2 times about really getting to know Jesus, and asking Him if we are in any sin, lies or misunderstandings. Jesus gave me good signs around this woman. But not this time. He gave me bad signs around her. Jesus reminded me of His words in the book of Revelation. Jesus said 'Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent. Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne.' Jesus showed me He used me to help knock on the door for this woman, and Jesus showed me she is not really with Him. Are you REALLY with Jesus my friend? Or are you believing some of the many lies the devil has planted? Is Jesus knocking on your door? Or are you going to ignore Jesus' voice calling to you? My friends a time is coming when it will be TOO LATE. Be earnest and REPENT. Don't be foolish, and be sure to have a REAL relationship with Jesus, and not have a lukewarm prayer life. Ask Jesus if you are in anything that is displeasing to Him, to help you understand how it all works if you are unsure. To help give you eyes to see Him and ears to hear Him. Jesus said my sheep HEAR my voice and they KNOW ME. Get to know Jesus while you can my friends. Pray for those in Israel and Gaza, and those who will be brought into this conflict. Pray more people repent and cry out to Jesus before the fires of war and the other judgements of God come upon them. Pray for those whose family's are in grief, and despair because of these terrible things happening. Jesus bless you.",,100,"{'like_count': 43, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 123812}",Repent!

facebook,"Christians Joining The Masonic Lodge? By: I. D. Byars Man was created a responsible human being, responsible for his salvation and responsible in remaining in a saved condition as long as he lives. Peter makes it very plain that God "". . . hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness . . . (II Peter 1:3),"" and that ""salvation is found in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven given unto man by which we must be saved (Acts 4:12)."" Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, ""and no man can come to God except through Him (John 14:6)."" Obedience to God's Word puts one IN Christ (Galatians 3:27). The Lord adds him to His church (Acts 2:47), where ALL the saved are, therefore, being in a saved condition, what other institution is needed? The Masonic Lodge was unknown many hundred years this side of the New Testament writers, therefore they could not write about anything that was not revealed to them. IF there had been a Masonic Lodge during the days of the apostles they would have written against any Christian being a member of it. Judge imagine a Christian calling a human being ""Worshipful Master."" The Bible teaches that a Christian has but ONE master, and that is Jesus the Christ (Matthew 23:10). Masons have many ""gods,"" but they cannot accept Christ, nor can they pray in His Name. Christians are taught by God's Word to ""do all things in the name [by the authority] of Christ (Colossians 3:17),"" but Christ has not given authority for ANYONE to be a member of the Masonic Lodge, or any other religious denomination. The use of the BIble or any other ""sacred book"" in Masonic Lodges are simply symbolic, because the Bible to Masons of the Islamic persuasion is but one book among several to ""symbolize"" the will of their god. How can a Christian, who believes that the Bible only is in fact the revealed Word of God, subscribe to such a sinful life as the Masonic Lodge? As a Mason advances to higher degrees in the Lodge, he must take oaths that include things that are in conflict with the Word of God - he must take part in ""ceremonies,"" which are very ""superstitious."" Our Lord and His apostles taught against ""swearing,"" and ""the doctrines of men"" that make void the Word (Matthew 5:34, Matthew 15:6-9, James 5:12). The Lodges teach that ""a good Mason"" is heaven bound - whether he is a member of the Lord's church or not, or even if he does or does not believe the teachings of Christ. The Bible teaches that only through Christ can salvation be obtained (Acts 4:12). ""Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. (Ephesians 3:21)."" Christians are not to be ""entangled in the affairs of this life (II Timothy 2:4)."" God gave us ""all things necessary"" but He did not give us Masonry. Therefore, it is a sin for a CHristian to become ""entangled"" in the religion of the Masonic Lodge.",,99,"{'like_count': 45, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 64505}",Church of Christ find lessons and information,,2023-10-21 00:59:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/310299877_471363555142988_1645342052970307694_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=a0wdJk0GuxwAX84v6Fg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBZUAxBEuqZHsXMy6J-nM4X1ecJ50Sa2Kb8lipT59jgTA&oe=655BA962,https://www.facebook.com/100068080432185/posts/702545155358159,

facebook,"Israeli Troops Raid Home Of Senior Hamas Leader, Detain Family Members, Others Israeli troops on Saturday raided the West Bank home of a senior Hamas leader and detained members of his family, witnesses said. Saleh al-Aruri is the deputy to Hamas’ overall leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and one of the founders of the Islamist group’s military wing. Based in Lebanon, he is a key target for Israel following the October 7 attacks when Hamas militants from Gaza stormed into southern Israel and killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and seized more than 200 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Since then, more than 4,300 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have been killed in relentless Israeli bombardments, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. Troops entered Aruri’s home in Arura village, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Ramallah, at dawn on Saturday, arresting more than 20 people, including one of his brothers and nine of his nephews, mayor Ali al-Khasib and witnesses told AFP. Dozens more were pulled in for questioning. Outside the house, troops put up a banner of the Hamas deputy against the background of an Israeli flag that read: “This was the house of Saleh Aruri and has become the headquarters of Abu al-Nimer — Israeli intelligence”, witnesses said, with images of it widely shared online. Village residents said Abu al-Nimer was an alias for the Israeli intelligence officer responsible for the area. In a statement, the army said the raid was jointly staged with the Shin Beth internal security service and resulted in the arrests of “dozens of Hamas members” among them relatives of Aruri. It confirmed using the house “for the detention and questioning of activists”. Israel has accused Aruri, who was named Haniyeh’s deputy in 2017, of organising several attacks. He spent almost 20 years in Israeli prisons and was freed in 2010 on condition that he go into exile. Since the Gaza conflict erupted, dozens of people have been killed in incidents with Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.",,94,"{'like_count': 62, 'comment_count': 26, 'num_users': 136912}",Lere Olayinka,,2023-10-21 22:26:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/354081886_10223600107615694_7574404000766807583_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=qgbe3caawocAX-Ax7KQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBSJ6B3VR7wnLIb51jxMd7hNTaLWWSghyhh8vMUUTWRVQ&oe=655AC092,https://www.facebook.com/lere.olayinka/posts/10224411866029147,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/395180785_10224411865789141_4481766422357729352_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=9mU0IfgVIVIAX8G2KnO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfByddhG-NlY3lRKR2hG6G-gdKwZ3NYMSBdywaCCqRfR2Q&oe=6538BE6A

Yes, I know I have speak about setting goals a lot in these challenges, but before you judge me, read this. From my experiences and that of successful men, I have found out that the best way to achieve what we want in life is to set SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE goals. A few years ago, I developed this habit. I always had goals to achieve. I set goals for grades I wanted to reach in school, financial goals, and my personal goals. That's good right? WRONG! I ended up achieving little and failing a lot! Why? Because it's not just the goal that mattered but the SYSTEM I used. You are probably wondering what the difference between ""SYSTEM"" and ""GOAL"" is. 📌 Note this: A GOAL is simply the result you want to achieve. A SYSTEM, however is simply the PROCESSES that lead to those results. Goals are the targets you want to achieve while systems are the processes you put in place to help you achieve them. If we further break it down: Goals tell you where you want to go; they're focused on tomorrow. Systems tell you what you need to do every day to get there; they're focused on today. If you're a student, your goals might be to get the highest grade or to clear all your papers with distinction. Your system is the way you read and manage your activities. If you were a coach, your goals might be to win championships. Your system is the way you recruit players and conduct practice. Does that make sense? Now, the interesting question here is, ""If you completely neglect your goals and focus on your system, will you succeed?"" I think you would. The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game looking at the scoreboard. The only way to win is to practice and get better each day. My coach would always say that ""the score takes care of itself""- the same is true in other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals and instead focus on the system. What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your system! ‼️WHY YOU SHOULD FORGET ABOUT YOUR GOALS AND FOCUS ON YOUR SYSTEM. 1: 𝐖𝐈𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐑𝐒 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐋𝐎𝐒E𝐑𝐒 𝐇𝐀𝐕𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐀𝐌𝐄 𝐆𝐎𝐀𝐋𝐒 . You read that right. Everybody wants to get the job, every Olympian wants to win a medal, and if successful and unsuccessful men set the same goals, then the goals cannot differentiate the winner from the loser. 2: 𝐀𝐂𝐇𝐈𝐄𝐕𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐆𝐎𝐀𝐋 𝐈𝐒 𝐎𝐍𝐋𝐘 𝐀 𝐌𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐀𝐑𝐘 𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐆𝐄. Achieving goals only changes your life for a minute. We think we need to change the results, but the results are not the problem. 3: 𝐆𝐎𝐀𝐋𝐒 𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐂𝐓 𝐘𝐎𝐔𝐑 𝐇𝐀𝐏𝐏𝐈𝐍𝐄𝐒𝐒. There is always this implicit assumption behind any goal: ""Once I reach my goals, I'll be happy."" Goals create ""either"" or ""conflict"": either you achieve your goals and be successful, or you fail and be disappointed. FINAL WORD: The purpose of goals is to win the game but the purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

facebook,"This is a very difficult time – we can help each other The situation is tense in the region. Our thoughts are with the people suffering and most affected. We are witnessing horrific suffering of innocent lives, the disappearance of humanity. We are sad, we are stressed, we are scared - mostly we feel helpless. Each hour that goes by brings a possibility of conflict spilling over. In four years we suffered through economic crisis, nationwide protests, shortage of food, electricity, fuel, medication, hyperinflation. Coronavirus. Terrible Beirut explosion. More protests, a full year with no government. Many went through the 2006 war and helped animals. We did not imagine we would reach this level of atrocities. We have to be strong – not for us but for the animals that depend on us. We have over 100 cats and dogs, two young lions, six baboons, and other wildlife we are working on. Lions scheduled to leave to a sanctuary in South Africa, baboons to a sanctuary in the UK, cats and dogs to various countries. These trips are now at risk and we fear they might be stuck. We are now receiving dozens of requests per day for help with people leaving Lebanon with their pets. We are helping make sure they have the right documents and permits, buy traveling cages, making flight reservations, or updating veterinary records so they are prepared in case they need to leave suddenly. You can check the travel guidelines in our previous post. We are trying to build up a three-to-six-month supply for our own animals and so we can help the community. We have to be prepared in case the situation gets worse.

facebook,"Bit of a long winded post but please bear with me. A lot of my posts are now being intercepted by people on the ""Pro"" OSWF side and that's fine, I have no trouble chatting to people about my views, but it does my head in a little when they take the ""high ground"" and try to pass themselves off as the more learned people and the ""Anti"" OSWF group as a bunch of unintelligent whingers. I'm constantly being told to ""prove"" or ""supply source"" or show us ""Government information"" regarding negative impacts on Whale migration, Sea Bird population, impacts on the sea bed floor and so on. The ""Pro"" side know that information like this is extremely difficult to obtain (for the most part this information doesn't even exist) and that's because the experts in these fields are unclear as to the long term impacts these wind farms may have (also researchers are unable to enter exclusion zones to see the effects and write reports). I liken this a bit to smoking, initially the government had no information with regards to tobacco's safety, so they relied on information provided by the tobacco industry (no conflict of interest there right?) then when the government approved the sale of tobacco, Doctors told everybody that it was safe (I believe many Doctors actually recommended some of their patients to smoke), then they were unsure if it was safe, then the Doctors finally said to stop smoking or it will kill you. Tobacco was allowed to be available even though they didn't have all the important facts at the beginning. It's still sold today even though the government KNOWS it kills people because they are addicted to the revenue it generates. Now a days when a new product is introduced into a marketplace, the company launching the new product needs to prove it's safety to people and the planet - This has not happened here. Again, the government is relying on information provided by the big companies who are actually behind the projects. Sound familiar? No conflict of interest here either right? In the same way that we can't provide definitive information showing the negative impacts of OSWF's, the ""Pro"" side also can't provide us with definitive proof that these things are safe. So to these people I say NO, you have it ALL WRONG. It should NOT be incumbent on people from the ""Anti"" OSWF side to ""prove"" or ""provide expert or government information"" or indeed provide any information at all. If you are so intelligent and know more than the experts who aren't even sure of the long term impacts on whale migration, calving, sea bird population, damage to the sea bed floor etc. and can prove the absolute safety of these OSWF's I put it to you - Prove it, show us TRULY INDEPENDENT expert information proving their safety (not information provided by the very companies that with be profiting, because so far, the public consultation, information provided and answers to our questions have been pathetic.",,89,"{'like_count': 48, 'comment_count': 31, 'num_users': 7742}",No Offshore Wind Farms Illawarra.,,2023-10-21 01:33:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/397738821_10232155449647835_7034024705100642305_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=y2yHqTJa1Q8AX_KnfNX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAwOdp9gEP58dwWQVMcvpJBmwawu6l_S1pT0kwvjhtUMQ&oe=655A8175,https://www.facebook.com/groups/221120457510451/permalink/290895350532961,

""It was great being part of such an activity, especially for us freshmen who are new and just experienced these events for the first time. It is indeed ice-breaking to experience it after the somewhat long hell week during midterms. Also, it's great meeting people from different organizations and socializing with them proved the critical importance of collaboration between different organizations to resolve some shortcomings of the event,"" Jameson Javelle Meña, Junior Officer on Audit for COESSE - TSU Psychological Society, said in an interview. Another freshman from the Psychology Department, Dexter Jan Abalos, also a member of Kaya Natin Youth - TSU, described how their group found rhythm after a slow start, with stories of camaraderie, conflict, and other memories stirred up during the games. ""I can't say na perfect yung teamwork namin but at the end of the games, do’n po kami nag-usap at nag-reflect para maging aware sa mga pagkakamali namin at mag-grow as future student leaders,"" Dexter expressed.

Alacre, who worked as a caregiver in Israel, was one of the four Filipino casualties confirmed in the ongoing crisis. She had been dedicatedly serving as a caregiver, supporting her family in the Philippines. Various national agencies and the Philippine Embassy in Israel worked to ensure the repatriation of the body in coordination with Israeli authorities and airlines. This tragic incident underscores the challenges faced by OFWs working in conflict zones.

facebook,"Psalm 110:3 KJV [3] Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, .. Serving The Lord isn't a hobby or an activity borne out of convenience It's founded upon sacrifice . The above scripture teaches sacrifice . It's for the church today . The last days are upon us. Days that call for intensity in walking with and for The Lord. We must respond to the prophetic intimation of the holy writ. Everyman who walked with God lived sacrificial lives. It's not enough to be blessed and enjoy. Philippians 1:29-30 KJV [29] For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; [30] Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me. We also suffer for his name. It means to permit things, allow what wasn't in before. This relates with your plans and pursuits. Are you willing to let go of your own ambitions and pursue His? Forsake your pleasure and seek His... Our lives mustn't be about us and our desires ... 2 Corinthians 5:15 KJV [15] And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. We don't live unto ourselves anymore but unto Him. What is about Him? Souls! Luke 19:10 KJV [10] For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. He came, lived, died and rose again for just ONE REASON...., Souls saved and coming into the knowledge of God. If you aren't living for that, you are not living for Christ. He didn't come to overthrow an earthly government and set up His. He didn't come to set up global business conglomerates. He came to build His church. His church, those called out from the world into the light by the gospel. He didn't come to make great men of influence, wealth and prominence. He came to make a soul winner out of you and I. Luke 5:10 KJV Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. Are you willing? Willing to change your course in life if need be. Willing to sacrifice your earthly pursuit for a heavenly one. Will you resign your job for the gospel if it so demands? Relocate if it so requires? Wake up daily at night to pray if it calls for it? Fast often if it's needed? Go out daily to preach? Drop your car behind and take public transport in order to reach out for more souls! We often cry over losing loved ones, bemoan business losses, weep over broken relationships, lament over failed governments etc. But are these eternal issues or just selfish matters? When last did you weep over a sinner going to hell, a Backslider - Christian, an area rebellious to the Word? This is where heaven is concerned.! Luke 15:7 KJV [7] I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. Even angels know this. They don't rejoice because of your wedding day, new job, house etc. But over an addition to the kingdom of Christ. Are you willing to make this your singular, number pursuit one in life and give up whatever stands in your way from this? I encourage as many as make this their life pursuits, keep at it, don’t tire out. 1 Corinthians 15:58 KJV [58] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. It's never in vain. You might not own big houses, cars and cities. But you have a reward with God. You have souls, that matters to God. 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 KJV [19] For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 20] For ye are our glory and joy. Your glory and joy. 2 Timothy 2:3-5 KJV [3] Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 4] No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. 5] And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. Keep at it. Don't yield to the world and its daily demands. It's time to shine your evangelism sandals! And stir up purpose. And to those who left this purpose to pursue other things, some even now criticize ministers, I know its borne out of guilt of un fulfillment. Receive restoration. No need fooling yourself. It's time to return to purpose. In the day of His power. I recommend the following teachings for you available On livingwordmedia ""Heralding the Lordship of the Word"" ""In the day of His power "" ""Making your life count."" If you have heard them tell me what you saw. I believe in your ministry I believe you will fulfill it I believe you are wiling Have a fulfilled week ahead I call you blessed Jesus is Lord, We Win!

facebook,"Please join the Local 100 Fightback Coalition as we talk about the topic that no one wants to talk about, but WE MUST. To be clear, the horrific and murderous Hamas' terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians can NEVER be justified. We do not support in any way any acts of terrorism against civilians, and there is no way to EVER justify anti-human violence against unarmed civilians for just existing and living their lives. But that does not change the fact that these attacks were the inevitable consequence of the brutal occupation, Apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and mass murder that Palestinians have faced for decades at the hands of Israel. To analyze where the roots of the violence we are seeing comes from is not in any way to excuse any act of terrorism. The brutal conflict between the fascistic Apartheid state of Israel and the Palestinian people is a world historic struggle that has massive implications across the world for every struggle for human, civil and democratic rights. The almost complete silence of the US Labor movement in response to the Israeli creation of the world's largest open air prison or concentration camp in Gaza, their government's carpet bombing and collective punishment of the Palestinian people is shameful and disgraceful. Their silence also exposes the labor movement's political and moral bankruptcy, and its' cowardice in understanding what should be the historic role of the labor movement. Which has always been to organize a collective self- defense of the working class internationally against any and all fascistic attempts to destroy and wipe out democratic, human and civil rights. We cannot be neutral on these issues no matter how much we would like to turn our eyes away from the horrors that imperialism has created in this region by weaponizing the justified fears and anxieties of two oppressed peoples in their struggle for self determination or their ""solution"" which is a colonial settler Apartheid relationship.",,82,"{'like_count': 2, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 2434}",Local 100 Fightback,,2023-10-21 01:10:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/305486934_443861211096175_4571322024722840626_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=cB8TfLricAgAX-vRnij&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC2mzN5rB0KaIIzEr1HRd8mo6s0-O1msSlAHVTkV4CloQ&oe=655A6A27,https://www.facebook.com/100064168984051/posts/1022823315627816,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/394036777_1791670091267397_4566129033445839468_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=7Aud4fj42dQAX9VhhEa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBFvJNESBcGsCD4hA6b1hr7CZ3Iz5D36-4hqq0F2XYpYA&oe=653895C2

facebook,"BREAKING ! BRGIE adopts charter on Biafra Declaration in Helsinki Finland. The Biafra Republic Government in Exile, BRGIE has adopted charter on Biafra Declaration in an extraordinary conference held in Helsinki Finland. Mazi Simon Ekpa, the Prime Minister Biafra Republic Government in Exile and Finland-based lawyer disclosed this in in a statement on Friday at the two-day convention. He said there is no going back on the actualization of the Biafra referendum as BRGIE voted and adopted the Biafra Charter called the Biafra Helsinki Declaration 2023. Speaking at the convention now known as the ‘Biafra Helsinki Declaration October 20-21, 2023’, Ekpa stated that the Nigerian government is yet to tackle the root of Biafra agitation. He explained that the Biafra agitation, which started due to the marginalization of Igbos in Nigeria, has degenerated into self-preservation. He accused the Nigerian government of continued injustice and unfairness against the people of Biafra. Ekpa insisted that without equity and fairness, the idea of ‘one Nigeria’ is not sustainable. Consequently, Ekpa noted that Igbos have declared Biafra De Facto Government (BDFG) and BRGIE to serve the Nation and People of the southeast under the occupation of Nigeria. He added that Biafra should be allowed to have its independence and liberation. ‘”It is as though there is an international conspiracy not to talk about the ongoing conflict in Nigeria. For over a decade now, Biafrans are again been agitating for freedom. What was initially motivated by agitation against marginalization has transformed into agitation for self-preservation. “Agitation for Biafra that reemerged again more than a decade ago to protest exclusion from governance and marginalization regarding resource sharing and infrastructure development has since turned to agitation for self-preservation. “They are yet to make any concessions regarding the fundamental causes of the agitation in the first place. “Citizens of the world have a right to express their displeasure with their governments, and most reasonable countries respond with dialogue and engagement. But in Nigeria, the story is different. “Yet people talk about “one Nigeria.” No country will be one without inclusion, equity, and justice. “Terror against Biafra continued instead of engaging in dialogue and making a sustained effort to address grievances, which has the opposite effect. You cannot claim one Nigeria while at the same time excluding segments of the country from the benefits of belonging to the same country. “When you choose marginalization as a tool, you have wittingly or unwittingly signed up to fail”, he stated.",,81,"{'like_count': 55, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 28221}",VOICE OF BIAFRA 97.5 FM☑️,,2023-10-21 11:05:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/382807118_860131762175737_1647431307542865693_n.jpg?stp=c8.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=KXedTWB9fOQAX8hwdgQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfArjzDksAWD1kauOwL73_75-c6azeH5hnZ-Z3KpUdfslw&oe=655B5460,https://www.facebook.com/groups/347117261995601/permalink/24212536218360371,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394513823_2532309230276625_495627983231710075_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=0HHMneWSXlAAX_rEBWA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA9yuFh89U38VH-p6toTGHQigFxO1j25JHXKe32t3W7gA&oe=65390D49
facebook,"Yesterday I watched Anderson Cooper’s _The Whole Story: Terror in Israel_ that focused on the Hamas attack on the music festival in Israel. It is graphic and hard to watch, but also very necessary to watch. Of course I’d heard about what happened, but to hear stories from survivors and to see images of the brutality brought a perspective that I had not had before. It reminded me of how lucky I am not to be so accustomed to seeing missiles in the air that it doesn’t scare me. It showed me what real inhumanity looks like. And worst of all, it showed me the carnage of generational hate. I don’t know the answer to the conflict in Gaza- I don’t know if there will ever be a resolution to it.

facebook,"Jonglei: Two SPLA-IO generals defect in major blow to Machar Two high-ranking generals from Dr. Riek Machar’s SPLA-IO have defected to the SSPDF and the SPLM party led by President Salva Kiir. The latest defection marks a significant shift in the everchanging political landscape of Jonglei State. The switch of allegiance by Major-General Michael Wal Nyak and Major-General Samuel Both Tap was made in a declaration issued on Friday in the town of Waat in Nyirol County. Maj. Gen. Michael Wal, who served as the acting SPLA-IO’s sector three commander in Jonglei, told Radio Tamazuj on Friday evening that his decision to abandon the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-Opposition (SPLA-IO) led by First Vice President Riek Machar and join the South Sudan People’s Defense Forces (SSPDF) was in good faith. “Major-General Both and I defected along with 300 soldiers to the SSPDF. We feel there is no reason to remain in the bush suffering under trees while Riek Machar has been in Juba for the last six years without even thinking about us,” Gen. Wal said. “Again, SSPDF is where I had left from as a brigadier-general, and it is my right to rejoin Bilpam for the sake of peace.” Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Samuel Both, another top-ranking SPLA-IO officer, said their declaration was a gesture of peace. “Why would we remain in Juba when Riek is in Juba? So we must be in Juba, where the peace deal is being implemented. We are for peace, so we left without a single shot.” Responding to the defection, Lt. Gen. Daniel Koang Chuol, the SPLA-IO’s sector three commander, admitted that the two generals abandoned his command. “Gen. Michael Wal defected from one of our headquarters in Motot to Waat with only seven of his relatives plus Gen. Both. Their sons even refused to defect with them because they had no cause. Some individuals paid them to create confusion, but the entire community is not standing with them. There was no fighting because I believe we are in the same government but only that we are waiting for the security arrangements to be implemented fully,” he said. Two years after independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan plunged into a civil war. A peace agreement was reached, but another conflict erupted in 2016 before a second peace accord—the 2018 peace agreement—was signed. The partners to the peace agreement are yet to unify and deploy armed forces. The formation of a unified army is a cornerstone of the September 2018 peace agreement. ~RT",,80,"{'like_count': 41, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 68929}",Dalwuot Media,,2023-10-21 18:47:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/308634375_499825772142447_1850138323415339134_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mC0-Yl-_MT0AX9W4AOF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB6fwtPeXiX13c5WVQCvj8pjNINvht6bzKA5tc6phkiKQ&oe=655AFEAA,https://www.facebook.com/100063450866359/posts/756082149850140,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394076498_756082116516810_5199603052998050053_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7y6KOonOBbYAX-EjM3E&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfASCXyUd7i3v7LirfsIfRXogO_QTKT0L8HaX_9RzRbOqw&oe=6539600C

Perhaps you are going through a divorce or a marital conflict, feeling pain in your heart, and you want to draw near to God.
Perhaps you see this world as too dark and evil, feeling pessimistic and disappointed, and you want to draw near to God.
Perhaps you have lost loved ones, feeling grief and loneliness, and you want to draw near to God for comfort.
No matter what environment we are in, God knows the sorrow and pain in our hearts.
God says, """"When you are weary and when you begin to feel something of the bleak desolation of this world, do not be lost, do not cry. Almighty God, the Watcher, will embrace your arrival at any time. He is keeping watch by your side, waiting for you to turn back around. He is waiting for the day you suddenly recover your memory: when you realize that you came from God, that, at some unknown time you lost your direction, at some unknown time you lost consciousness on the road, and at some unknown time acquired a ‘father’; when you realize, furthermore, that the Almighty has always been keeping watch, waiting there a very, very long time for your return. He has been watching with desperate longing, waiting for a response without an answer. His watching and waiting are beyond any price, and they are for the sake of the human heart and the human spirit. Perhaps this watching and waiting are indefinite, and perhaps they are at an end. But you should know exactly where your heart and your spirit are right now.""""

And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it Lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the money for the tax.” And they brought him a coin. And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. _*The Gospel of the Lord.*_ Reflection. Resolving Conflict The Pharisees went off and plotted how they might entrap him in speech. They sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. And you are not concerned with anyone’s opinion, for you do not regard a person’s status. Tell us, then, what is your opinion: Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?” Matthew 22:15–17 It has been said that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” In other words, two people who are enemies with each other will often join together if they see an opportunity to jointly attack an even greater enemy. This is what was happening in today’s Gospel. Jesus was considered the greatest enemy of the Pharisees and the Herodians, and both of these groups joined together in a plot to trap Jesus even though they greatly disliked each other. The Pharisees were very nationalistic and were strict observers of the Law of Moses. It was their view that the people should not have to pay taxes to the Romans, and many of the people agreed. The Herodians supported the Romans and, therefore, were supporters of Herod, the Jewish ruler appointed by the Roman Emperor. One of Herod’s responsibilities was to obtain taxes from the Jews for use by the Roman government. Those who opposed the paying of taxes to the Romans could even be put to death. This joint questioning of Jesus had one goal: to get Him in trouble. If Jesus said it was unlawful to pay taxes to Caesar, Herod’s soldiers could arrest Him. If Jesus said that the people should pay taxes to Caesar, the Pharisees could turn the people against Him. It appeared to be a lose-lose question posed to Jesus. Of course, Jesus’ answer was perfect. Without violating the Law of God, He also refrained from violating (truncated)",,79,"{'like_count': 45, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 54053}",Ugandan Catholics,,2023-10-21 17:24:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292940894_200822845610861_838188902890013917_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6XErz50EQsMAX_SZ-bV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBdIx51M0Pu6UGkW1uH2PQc-y8CxIhqaHOGk0wBxpVisA&oe=655AD25C,https://www.facebook.com/100070494398733/posts/372463085113502,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394201490_372463061780171_5885543042125151233_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=L8YF85QLNBIAX_jwjPo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA99Dkbs7Z5xygUYHRk2q0okZ-GgzPsKIVK6lHrwHiuKA&oe=65389EB1

facebook,"October 22, 2023 Twenty-Ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time (Year A) Catholic Daily GOSPEL Reflections 🔥 Resolving Conflict The Pharisees went off and plotted how they might entrap him in speech. They sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. And you are not concerned with anyone’s opinion, for you do not regard a person’s status. Tell us, then, what is your opinion: Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?” Matthew 22:15–17 It has been said that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” In other words, two people who are enemies with each other will often join together if they see an opportunity to jointly attack an even greater enemy. This is what was happening in today’s Gospel. Jesus was considered the greatest enemy of the Pharisees and the Herodians, and both of these groups joined together in a plot to trap Jesus even though they greatly disliked each other. The Pharisees were very nationalistic and were strict observers of the Law of Moses. It was their view that the people should not have to pay taxes to the Romans, and many of the people agreed. The Herodians supported the Romans and, therefore, were supporters of Herod, the Jewish ruler appointed by the Roman Emperor. One of Herod’s responsibilities was to obtain taxes from the Jews for use by the Roman government. Those who opposed the paying of taxes to the Romans could even be put to death. This joint questioning of Jesus had one goal: to get Him in trouble. If Jesus said it was unlawful to pay taxes to Caesar, Herod’s soldiers could arrest Him. If Jesus said that the people should pay taxes to Caesar, the Pharisees could turn the people against Him. It appeared to be a lose-lose question posed to Jesus. Of course, Jesus’ answer was perfect. Without violating the Law of God, He also refrained from violating the civil law. Upon hearing His answer, all who heard Him “were amazed, and leaving him they went away.” The lesson learned from this passage is an especially important lesson to apply to family life. It is very common for conflicts to arise from time to time among those who are close to each other. When that happens, we can often take the approach of trying to trap the other person and trip them up with our deceptive reasoning. When this happens between two people, the conversation often turns into a shouting match with each party seeking only to find fault with the other. The solution to such situations is simple. Every conflict must be resolved by the truth. Jesus did this perfectly. He did not attack when He was attacked. He did not defend Himself irrationally. He did not shy away from the confrontation. He did not manipulate the truth to His own advantage. Instead, He spoke openly and honestly the full truth and refused to engage his opponents in their trickery. Consider this question. What if you were in Jesus’ position and the Pharisees came to you, asking you this question? What would you be tempted to answer? Most likely, you would try to answer them in such a way that appeased them. You might whisper, “We shouldn’t pay the taxes but don’t tell that to the Herodians.” And if the Herodians were to ask you that question, you might be tempted to give a different answer that appeased them. Oftentimes, when we feel as though another person is trying to trap us, condemn us, or challenge us, we become more concerned about our defense than with the honest truth. We can become afraid to say anything that will give them reason to attack us. We will be tempted to twist our answers rather than speak forthrightly with sincerity and honesty. This will never resolve a conflict. The only way to resolve anything is with the truth. Reflect, today, upon how you work to resolve conflict when it arises. Are you more like the Pharisees and Herodians whose only goal was to trick, trap and win? Do you see the other as an enemy in those moments? Or do you strive to be like Jesus who didn’t shy away from the conversation, answering honestly and directly? Of course, the truth was easy for Jesus since He was without any fault. In our lives, the truth may require that we admit our sin and apologize when confronted. However, if the truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth is our goal, then our conversations will imitate Jesus and, most often, a peaceful resolution will ensue. My truthful Lord, Your wisdom is perfect and Your words are truth. Please give me the gifts of wisdom and all truth, especially when conflicts arise. In those moments, please keep me from reacting in an angry and defensive way so that I can always be an instrument of the unity You desire. Jesus, I trust in You.

facebook,"Our Daily Prayer The Authority of Jesus Challenged Today's Gospel is from Matthew 22:15-21 The Pharisees went off and plotted how they might entrap Jesus in speech. They sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, ""Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. And you are not concerned with anyone's opinion, for you do not regard a person's status. Tell us, then, what is your opinion: Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?"" Knowing their malice, Jesus said, ""Why are you testing me, you hypocrites? Show me the coin that pays the census tax."" Then they handed him the Roman coin. He said to them, ""Whose image is this and whose inscription?"" They replied, ""Caesar's."" At that he said to them, ""Then repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God."" In Matthew 22:15-21, the Pharisees and Herodians attempt to trap Jesus with a question about paying taxes to Caesar. They ask him, ""Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"" (Matthew 22:17) Jesus knows their intent, and he asks them to show him a coin. When they do, he asks them, ""Whose image and inscription is this?"" (Matthew 22:20) They reply, ""Caesar's."" (Matthew 22:21) Jesus then tells them, ""Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."" (Matthew 22:21) This passage is often interpreted as a statement about the separation of church and state. However, it is important to note that Jesus is not saying that we should not pay taxes. In fact, he is saying that we should pay our taxes because they are due to Caesar or the state. What Jesus is saying is that there are two different authorities in the world: the authority of the state and the authority of God. The state is responsible for maintaining order and providing for the common good. God is responsible for our spiritual well-being. We are obligated to obey both authorities. We must pay our taxes and obey the laws of the land. However, we must also obey God's laws. If there is a conflict between the laws of the state and the laws of God, we must obey God. This passage is a reminder that we are citizens of two kingdoms: the kingdom of this world and the kingdom of God. We have obligations to both kingdoms, but our ultimate allegiance is to God.

facebook,"Dear 100-Level Student ​ ​ ​ You see, the motivation to read can be very spontaneous. It could be an effect of a short moment of self-reflectionor anything at all. ​ But then, that motivation needs to be met with some other factors, so your decision could be speedy. These factors are catalysts. They help speed up your decision process. ​ ​ For me, some of these factors include: ​ ✔ A filled stomach, is very important. ​ ✔ A clear head. ​ ✔ A clean environment. ​ ​ ​ Reading actually is an exercise, and it requires a reasonable amount of energy. Food gives you that energy (if you can do away with junk, please do). Lol, let me personalise it, food gives me the energy I need to read. ​ ​ ​ Have you noticed what happens when you try to read on an empty stomach? You keep reading a particular line over and over again until whatever you're reading loses its meaning. Yes, I'm talking from experience. As of that moment, the energy you need to comprehend what you're reading is lacking. You need to refill. ​ ​ ​ A clear head gives room for more information to be received, and stored. If you're like me, the mere thought of having some dirty clothes to wash can affect my reading time or pattern. Sometimes, it goes like this; ​ ​ ​ ""Soil texture is the degree of… chai! The dress I wore yesterday with the ones in that bucket makes it six dirty clothes I have to wash. Omo! I don't have detergent again, and I don't have any cash on me. Eh! Fareedah owes me 1k, let me go and ask her before she goes to Dama"". ​ ​ ​ And then in Fareedah's room, there will be something to talk about. Goodbye soil texture. ​ ​ ​ ​ Phew! ​ ​ Notice how it all started with a simple thought? That's how a disturbed mind can alter your reading process. Yours might be different. It could be the need to cook, a troubling issue at home, an unresolved conflict, or what have you. A cluttered mind is a stressed mind, and a stressed mind is a closed mind. ​ ​ ​ Still using myself as a case study on the importance of a clean environment. A clean environment boosts my creativity. I write better when my environment is clean, I read better, I sleep better. ​ ​ Your bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and other areas are your environment. These parts of where you live are like your mind on display. Remember what happens to a cluttered mind? Yes. ​ ​ You may have noticed how sluggish you are in a dirty environment. The same way to count your steps, and block your nostrils in disgust when you walk past an area littered with filth is the same way your brain acts when it senses that your environment is dirty. Every action you take is as a result of the signals your brain sends to you. There is always a pattern. ​ ​ How do you read when you can't even breathe? ​ ​ Perhaps you can read but how do you assimilate when your brain is struggling with what to focus on? ​ ​ ⭕What You Can Do This Weekend To Help Yourself⭕ ​ ​ ​ ✔ Save yourself some weekday stress. Cook. If you can, make a stew that will last for a few days into the week. That way you're not always worried about what to eat or cook when you're back from class. That moment of thought is another level of stress on its own, you don't need it. That way, you also get time to rest after a stressful day. You need all the rest you can get. ​ ​ ​ ​ ✔ About a clear head. You need to declutter to the tiniest detail. Wash your plates, do your laundry, pick your clothes for the following week, fetch water, resolve your conflicts, dwell on the situations you have control over, and set yourself up for a great mood (music works for me). Basically, try to free your mind, and create space in your head for assimilation. ​ ​ ​ ​ ✔ A clean environment. This weekend just do what you always do, general sanitation. Wipe the walls and ceiling, make your bed, clear your reading table, rearrange your clothes, clean your shoe racks, mop your floor, and clean your kitchen and bathroom. If you have, use air freshener in moderation. Do everything to make your surroundings clean, and healthy, and enable you to read. ​ ​ ​ Don't underestimate the importance of doing these little things. They might seem little and insignificant but they make up the big issues. ​ ​ ​ It becomes easier for you to read for an impromptu test when you have no worries about what to eat, cooking, rumpled clothes on your bed or chairs to fold, meruwa to supply water e.t.c. ​ ​ ​ No, these things, however simple they sound, aren't always exciting to do. I know it's not easy, especially the financial aspect. The state of the country's economy is worrisome, however, there are times when you're financially buoyant. Take care of yourself. ​ ​ A happy stomach, a ready brain. ​ A cleared mind, a time to assimilate. ​ A clean environment is the motivation you need to start. ​ In all, a clever way to guard your state of mind, stay healthy, and be ready for success. I pray that God makes it easy for you to get the resources you need to excel. ​ Enjoy your weekend. ​ Aisha (truncated)",,74,"{'like_count': 44, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 73834}",FUTMINNA STUDENTS (PURPLE FAMILY 💜),,2023-10-21 09:01:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/342526411_600752182108402_8915873005261840468_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6ihgRXTci1QAX-MRIlv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDdAuyJJ37DF0jvfSKLnuwfYICskTOlK9TIMbgXTZNFTg&oe=655A3BAD,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1188195465253099/permalink/1543226439749998,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/394019351_3633070253579429_5907916611429504868_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=swD1o5Ys4usAX9Nuf00&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBREp1LlatPpemKQQ0JXHe1LsxHkX3t9aqWwxfpq-6kCw&oe=6537EDDC
facebook,"So we have to understand our life, the life that we lead, the life that has become meaningless, the life that is full of travail, sorrow, conflict, competition, dishonesty. And in learning about that we shall also learn what love is. And in learning what love is we shall learn also what death is, because life is all that - death, love and everyday living. And to merely concentrate on everyday living, that is, bread and butter, position, more things and so on, so on, so on, and neglect the rest of it, which is what the world is doing, therefore it is imbalance, therefore it is contradictory, and therefore it is mischievous. So we have to learn about the whole thing - death, love and daily living.

First we must see clearly for ourself what our daily living is. What is our living? What is the thing that we call living? Do we live, or do we tolerate living? Do we live according to an idea, according to a conclusion based on a belief, a dogma, a memory? Because the mind is always concerned with remembering, imagining, contriving. I do not know if... Please we are moving together. If you have observed your mind you will see imagination plays a tremendous part, remembering and calculating, contriving. On that is based our life, the daily existence, the images which we have built about each other in our relationship with each other. And these images have their relationship and so we lose direct relationship. If I have an image about you because I have lived with you for ten years, or five days, and you have your image about me because you have lived with me for ten days or five years, our relationship is essentially based on that image. The images have relationship, not you and I, there is no direct response between each other. And therefore relationship comes to an end. I don't know if you...

instagram,"Set was always stressful. Especially on a Gymkhana shoot. We set a high bar, that we kept raising. Subsequently, tensions raised, too. I wish I could say we always saw eye to eye, and never had friction, but that’s not real life. And, if I’m being honest with myself, it’s not how Ken wanted it. This photo was taken in San Fransisco, on production for Gymkhana FIVE. It had been seven years since we first met, and three years into working together full time. It was around this era that I realized that my willingness to disagree, and stand strong for my opinions, is why he trusted me. You see, Ken was that once-in-a-generation, creative genius in our space (Action Sports & Motorsports). He just saw it, and had the organization and acumen to make it reality. This meant that many didn’t dare oppose him. Blame my mom, the Queens kid in me, or that conflict is my love language, but I never hesitated to push back. And not only did he accept it, he respected it (mostly). That said, he never let me win easy. He taught me to prove my point, and own my ideas, but also to choose the best idea even if it wasn’t mine. He did this by example. And in the end, no matter the creative skirmish we’d have, he’d have a smile on his face moments later. It was just part of our relationship. My only regret is that sometimes I didn’t accept those smiles fast enough. 

Fucking miss you.

instagram,"The Foreign Ministries of Turkey, Egypt, and the World Health Organization (WHO) condemned the Israeli attack on Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital in Gaza, calling it a violation of international humanitarian law.

The UN Secretary-General and Saudi Arabia also condemned this attack, denouncing Israel's actions that killed at least 500 people, mostly civilians. The hospital was described as a shelter for people injured and displaced by previous attacks. All sides emphasized the need to protect civilians and abide by international humanitarian law in the conflict.

instagram,"A Bengaluru cop stopped the ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ chant during the Pakistan-Australia ICC World Cup match at M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Friday. Following this, a video of the incident is circulating on social media.

In the video, the cop can be heard asking the Pakistan fan not to raise the ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogan during the match. He said, “Bharat Mata ki Jai is allowed but not Pakistan Zindabad.”

However, when the Pakistan fan asked the cop to say the same on camera, he remained silent.

Reactions of netizens on ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ chant
On social media, the video has not only gone viral but also triggered reactions. Some supported the Pakistani fan, while others appreciated the cop’s action.

One of them wrote, “This is my problem. They are fans of Pakistan allowed by us with a visa. As long as they aren’t breaking any law, why should it concern who they cheer? The police officer seems worried more than concerned and isn’t sure why he had to ask the fan to stop cheering for his team. We all need to know where to draw our line when it comes to guests. If we don’t want them, let’s not give them visas. But we have to uphold the dignity of a sport.”

Another user wrote, “To avoid conflict and riots, you know how our crowd is, tomorrow they get violent and take law in their hands, to prevent that they are saying not to chant pakistan zindabad.”

instagram,"When Rathbone deBuys posts TikTok videos critiquing Israel in its conflict with Hamas, he turns to common strategies to avoid being detected and deleted by the social media giant.

In the subtitles of his videos, he uses terrier and violin emojis instead of the words “terrorist” and “violence.” At the bottom of his videos — which have collectively received millions of likes — he adds a disclaimer, saying the post is for “educational” purposes only. 

Changing the captions may make it less likely that the video will be flagged as violating TikTok’s rules against hateful rhetoric or violent content, deBuys said.

instagram,"It hasn't always been safe for you to show up and stay present.  In a moment of conflict, a young part of you might show up offering coping strategies that worked in the past - strategies that, while valid, are getting in the way of intimacy in the present.

We need to take these parts seriously.  This doesn't mean acting on them, it means listening.  Tuning in.  Offering them what was once so rare for them - attunement, responsiveness, non-judgment.

Once we have soothed those younger parts, we are better able to show up in our relationships in ways that are aligned with our values and desires.

instagram,"📸: Private Travis King, the US Army soldier who deserted his post and fled into North Korea earlier this year has now been officially charged.

King is being charged with desertion, assault on fellow soldiers, possessing a video of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, soliciting a minor on Snapchat to create pornographic content, attempting to leave base after curfew, drinking alcohol against orders and other offenses.

“The man I raised, the man I dropped off at boot camp, the man who spent the holidays with me before deploying did not drink. A mother knows her son, and I believe something happened to mine while he was deployed. The Army promised to investigate what happened at Camp Humphrey's, and I await the results.”

instagram,"@revkevindeyoung writes: 
‘Faithful friends help each other with their words. “Oil and perfume make the heart glad, and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel” (Prov. 27:9). The writer mentions two precious things in this proverb, oil and perfume, but neither are as precious as a wise friend.

We all know the proverb: “Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another” (Prov. 27:17). It’s a great word picture. Ask yourself: am I sponge that never hurts anyone, but never helps much either? Am I a sword that cuts to the quick but also destroys? Or am I a stone, the kind of friend upon which others can be sharpened, made better and more mature? Faithful friends make better stones than sponges or swords.

“Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13). That means the greatest friend is the one who laid down the most for his friends. No question who this is.

To be sure, Jesus is more than a friend, but not less. He is the Divine Friend better than any other. He is never a fake friend, but always seeks our best. Neither is he a foul friend. He is slow to anger instead of quick to criticize. He is thoughtful and tender instead of annoying. He’s always trustworthy and never lets us down. Best of all, Jesus is a faithful friend. He not only sympathizes and comforts you in trouble, he delivers you from your greatest trouble, which is sin. Not only does he speak the truth and handle conflict, he made peace through his blood when were at enmity with him.  And he doesn’t just make us better, he makes us new. What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear. What a privilege to carry everything to him in prayer.’

instagram,"Over the past month, Israel and Palestine have made international headlines for what is being recognized as a conflict between the Israeli army and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, after the October 7 bombing in Southern Israel that left 1,400 people dead. At least 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 12,000 have been injured in the wake of that night, according to the Palestinian Health Authority. The reactions across the globe have ranged widely and almost every country has expressed solidarity with either Israel or Palestine — who, as a result of the violence, have allies and enemies. Colombia, for example, officially declared its support for Palestine and likewise, pro-Palestine movements have grown throughout other countries in Latin America including Mexico and Venezuela.⁠
⁠
With the ongoing violence that’s led to the death of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians, the conflict has received global media coverage and gripped people on social media. As a result, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation rising as we are watching events unfold. It’s more important than ever that we are aware of what exactly is happening, the long history of events that led up to it, the historic ties between Palestine and Latin America, and how we as a community can show up. This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide but a starting place for education and allyship. Read on to learn more about the Free Palestine movement and how to help victims of the violence.⁠

instagram,"A report by Reuters delves into recent arrests of Arab citizens in Israel due to their social media posts expressing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. ⁠
⁠
In one case, Palestinian singer and neuroscientist Dalal Abu Amneh filed a complaint with Israeli police after receiving death threats in response to her social media post. The post featured a Palestinian flag emoji and the words ""There is no victor but God."" According to Reuters, Israeli authorities accused her of promoting hate speech and incitement to her nearly 300,000 followers. She was detained for two days, placed under house arrest, and prohibited from discussing the conflict for 45 days.⁠
⁠
In another case, a 60-year-old urban planner faced arrest for posting a sketch and analysis of potential Israeli ground invasion scenarios into Gaza. According to Reuters, ground Invasion scenarios are discussed regularly in Israeli media.⁠
⁠
Israel has established a specialized task force focused on tracking and combating online incitement to terrorism. Police spokesperson Eli Levy revealed that this special team, formed in February, had spotted nearly 180 posts since October 7th. ⁠
⁠
Levy said that out of the 96 individuals under investigation, 63 of them had already been detained, ""in some cases, within 40 minutes of the publication of a post"".⁠
⁠
""Look at this audacity and ungratefulness. Citizens with a blue, Israeli ID... have the audacity to think that we as police will allow them to take to the streets and support a murderous, Nazi terrorist organization,"" he said.⁠
⁠
Hassan Jabareen, the director of the Haifa-based centre for Arab minority rights Adalah, told Reuters it knows of ""at least 83 students who are facing disciplinary action at universities and that it received over 40 reports from employees who are at risk of being fired for social media posts expressing solidarity with Gaza.""⁠
⁠
""About 90% of the cases, legally speaking, have no basis,"" said Jabareen. ""The conduct of the police is illegal. You cannot arrest people over such things."" ⁠

instagram,"Broadcasting regulator Ofcom was quick to suspend its director of online safety supervision, after her apparently “extreme” views on Israel’s war on Gaza were exposed.

On Monday, rightwing website Guido Fawkes reported that Fadzai Madzingira had been sharing her views on the conflict on her private Instagram account. Later that day Ofcom suspended her pending further investigation.

In an Instagram story Madzingira told of her “panic” and “hopelessness” at what is going on in the Middle East. “My acoount [sic.] has been chaotic for the last week bouncing between the continued targeting of Palenstinians [sic.] and dumb shit. Mostly because I could not process that we continue to act with surprise at what happens in an apartheid state…” she wrote.

Madzingira also liked a post by BLM UK, criticising the UK’s support for Israel as a “vile colonial alliance”, saying the decision to send Royal Navy ships to the Middle East is participating in “ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians.”

Which bit of this is supposed to be shocking?

instagram,"Amplifying @savethechildren’s and the UN’s message and adding a few thoughts. It’s hard not to express the sheer helplessness and sorrow many of us are experiencing right now.  So much has been said. So much more can be said. And whatever anyone says today, is always going to upset someone or the other simply because perspective is very personal for each individual. But there are some feelings we all share. At least I believe that. We all share a love for peace. For a decent life. We share the right to safety and freedom. And we share a common bond of empathy when others in our tribe are being harmed. 

The fact is we are all collectively grieving right now. For the people of Gaza who are in an unimaginable situation and don’t seem to have any recourse to safety. Their plight gets worse by the minute. People have lost everything. This needs to stop. 
We feel for the families of citizens of Israel who were killed and the hostages that are still being held and whose fate is unknown. 
The fact is all people have one thing in common. They belong to the human race. And through no individual fault of theirs they are now suffering terribly. 

Don’t tell me this conflict cannot be stopped by Israel using more peaceful methods. I refuse to believe that. If there was a collective will to stop this, with the help of all the other nations trying so desperately to prevent further escalation - it is possible. 

A country doesn’t become weaker by ending a war or an invasion or an aggression. In fact it’s the opposite. Ditto for Hamas. Any desire to wipe out anyone else is never going to work. Humanity over politics is the only way out.

instagram,"I have some questions that I’ve been struggling to answer and I hope people can guide me in the right direction. Hope someone can relate.

Every morning when I wake up, one of the first things I think about is the conflict in Palestine and Israel. I immediately feel numb as this quiet sadness creeps in.

I ask myself how I can film myself putting on colourful makeup knowing the unimaginable suffering people are going through. Is it even appropriate? This leads me to two realisations.

The first is how powerless I am. I could want the same thing as what seems the entire world and that’s for the violence on innocents to end yet not know what you can actually do to help.

Make a social media post? Share a photo of the horrors we have all seen? Go to a protest? All of the above? What can I do as a genuine effort to help?

The second realisation is my immeasurable privilege. That’s because for the same people I lament for, all my questions are replaced by one that makes all of mine trite and empty. It’s because all they ask is “Will I live through the day?”.

That’s why I find myself quietly praying every day.  Not because I’m religious but because it feels like all I can really do.

Pray that we end this miserable cycle. Pray that we don’t lose any more innocents. Pray for a free Palestine 🇵🇸 

We are never truly free unless we all are ✌🏾

instagram,"The number of trucks that entered Gaza is 20 trucks, which is an insufficient quantity for Gaza's needs. Before the conflict, around 500 trucks used to enter Gaza daily.

After 15 days of complete closure and the full ban on water entering the strip, Gaza's current regular need is now 7,500 trucks. If we consider the conditions of destruction, it actually requires approximately 10,000 trucks. The occupation and the West allowed only 20 trucks, which is about 0.002% of what is required.

To be more precise, around 16,000 tons of various basic, food, and health materials, in addition to fuel, used to enter the strip daily.

instagram,"#War- Archbishop of Goa and Daman on Friday appealed the Christians to pray and fast for peace between Israel and Palestine on October 27

In a communication released here, Fr Ferrao said that in a world marred by conflict and suffering, the ongoing strife in Israel and Palestine stands as a stark reminder of the urgent need for peace in our world.

“We are witnessing a crisis that is claiming countless lives and causing immeasurable pain. Our Holy Father Francis is constantly voicing his concern for the humanitarian situation in Palestine and Israel, calling on all parties to lay down their weapons,” he said.

The Archbishop noted that speaking at his General Audience on the October 18, Fr Francis said “Lay down weapons and heed the cries for peace from the poor, the people, and the innocent children.

The Archbishop recalled that the Pope  called on all Christians to pray and fast for peace on Friday, October 27, 2023.

“He also encouraged people of other Christian denominations, other religions and all those who advocate for peace to participate as they see fit. The Pope

announced that the central event on Friday would be an hour of prayer at 6 pm in St. Peter’s Square, with the goal of invoking peace for the world,” Fr Ferrao said.

The Archbishop said that in response to our beloved Holy Father’s invitation, let us rise together and join him in observing coming Friday, the 27th of October, as a day of prayer, penance and fasting for peace in Israel and Palestine and between other war-torn countries and peoples.

“Prayer and penance can play a vital role in this endeavour. While we encourage individuals and families to join in this global spiritual exercise, we urge our Parish Priests, Chaplains, Heads of Institutions and of Religious Communities to organize for the people under their care at least an hour of prayer for this intention,” Fr Ferrao said.

instagram,"Meta has apologised for adding ""terrorist"" to the biographies of some Instagram users describing themselves as Palestinian. Meta said it fixed a problem ""that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations"" in some of its products. ""We sincerely apologise that this happened,"" it told the BBC.

Additionally, the platform has been accused of suppressing content that supported the Palestinians during the Israel-Gaza war.

Some users claim that because of their pro-Palestinian posts, they were ""shadow banned"" from Instagram. This is when a platform steps in to prevent posts from showing up in other users' feeds. The users claim 24-hour posts on Stories referencing the conflict have had fewer views than others and that their accounts cannot be found as easily in search.

Today, we joined partners in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol in prayer, in mourning, and in marching to demand the Biden administration call for a ceasefire. 

Israel receives billions in U.S. military aid, and is likely to receive billions more to support its war. The U.S. therefore bears responsibility for the conduct of Israel’s war.

⁠
“This money will support more than 1 million displaced in conflict affected Palestinians, including emergency needs in Gaza,” Biden said Wednesday during a speech in Tel Aviv.⁠
⁠
Biden warmed Hamas against attempting to divert the aid, saying that if the group attempts interferes, assistance will be cut off.⁠
⁠
“If Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people, and it will end as a practical matter,” Biden said. “It will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.”⁠

instagram,"From birth, we become attached to our parents, idolizing them as heroes and role models to follow and imitate. 

But as we grow older, we begin to question their ways and realize that they do not know everything. We begin to label them as controlling and abusing. 

In our teenage years, this judgement intensifies, leading to resentment in our adulthood.  We find ourselves blaming them for our traumas, relationships, and ingrained habits.

Yet, when we become parents, we repeat the patterns we once resented.  We slowly become what we judge and hate and the cycle repeats itself again. 

This is how trauma is passed on generation after generation. 

The moment you condemn a trait as undesirable, duality is created. When you judge your parents as controlling, your ego image of being non controlling is formed. 

All your controlling aspects become part of your shadow, hidden from conscious awareness. Then, without knowing you slowly become what you hate, you begin to control your diet, your schedule, your environment, your children.  It's all mechanical, there is no awareness.  Then, your children begin to judge and resent you, and unconsciously slowly begin to embody the same patterns. 

What if, instead, we paused to reflect on our childhood, viewing our parents through a lens of love and understanding rather than judgment?

It's in this shift that true healing emerges. Healing isn't about holding grudges or setting boundaries; those are merely ego responses to pain which lead to more suffering. 

To understand is to forgive. And when we forgive, we love.  That is a divine state of being which knows no separation, no pain, no conflict. You have the seed, just water it.

instagram,"A dire warning has emerged from United Nations human rights experts regarding Israel’s actions in the ongoing conflict in Gaza. In a statement by members of the UN Human Rights Council Special Procedures body, the experts warned that Israel is engaged in a systematic campaign of crimes against humanity, raising concerns of potential genocide against the Palestinian people. ‘Considering statements made by Israeli political leaders and their allies, accompanied by military action in Gaza and escalation of arrests and killing in the West Bank, there is also a risk of genocide against the Palestine people,’ they said.

The group pointed to a series of troubling events, including the deadly airstrike targeting a hospital (which Israel has repeatedly denied), and several refugee shelters. Alongside military actions in Gaza, there has been an escalation of arrests and killings in the West Bank, contributing to the growing concern. These events notwithstanding, Israel has precipitated a humanitarian crisis with a ‘total blockade’ of Gaza, blocking access to food, fuel and medical supplies. The UN group denounced these tactics as ‘domicide,’ and claimed they are in direct violation of international law. The UN experts have demanded an immediate ceasefire, full access to essential provisions such as food, water, fuel, electricity, medicine, and shelter, and comprehensive measures for ‘reparation, restitution, and reconstruction to ensure full justice for Palestinians.’",,2634,"{'like_count': 2318, 'comment_count': 316, 'num_users': 942100}",RT,,2023-10-21 05:46:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/36566815_495984907499440_1368966459903967232_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=3NOfq4jgTQsAX8jL2zY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAWhpJ8IVqNl_jDn5YLDnwDIT6dYVFjDLyOyBbflTRf7A&oe=655A5F8A,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cypk2brs7H9/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/394271280_732117652283764_8637631010254437944_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=mP_SyH3kUj8AX8j6f6t&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDg38VGupwAJRhPsv7rzSCNyoMJel1rE1Y8yNlFEdRe4Q&oe=6543A026

instagram,"When Gaza was bombed by Israel in 2014, the late architect Michael Sorkin was outraged by the devastation. He organized a project that invited designers to imagine a Gaza that was open and not devastated by war. @deensharp revisits their proposals. For Sorkin, at the heart of the conflict was a crisis of propinquity. He saw Israel’s separate and unequal provisioning of systems of water, sanitation, transportation, green space, and other infrastructure to Palestinians as an obvious and violent injustice that made it impossible for Israelis and Palestinians to understand each other and share space. His frustration was exacerbated by the fact that, as he had shown long ago in the case of Jerusalem, it was more than possible to plan an efficient and equitable shared city. Through his New York–based NGO, Terreform, a group of designers, environmentalists, planners, activists and scholars from Palestine, Israel, the U.S., UK, India and elsewhere responded to the brutality of Operation Protective Edge with ideas that look beyond Gaza as a site of bombing and deprivation. The result was a collection of projects and essays gathered together in the book, 'Open Gaza: Architectures of Hope.' In presenting its plan for a future Gaza, the contributors at Terreform, including Sorkin, admit that it comes out of a wild proposition: ""One thinks very differently about Gaza … if its political border disappears as a physical fact.""

Head to the link in our for a deeper look back at Terraform and other designers' proposals to reimagine Gaza as an open, shared territory connected to the broader world once again.

instagram,"I’ve had some confusion in the comments about my use of the term “conservative”, just want to clarify. When I use the term, it generally just means anyone who supports the status quo.
-$900+ billion military budget, used to involve the U.S. in every world conflict (almost never for good)
-A lightly regulated capitalist economy, where 90% of wealth is held by the top 10%, while the bottom 90% of earners get to fight over the remaining 10% (“fighting for scraps from the table, while slowly we rot on the floor” - Trial)
-Health care is a privilege and not a right (I’ve gone years without health insurance, and it’s almost impossible to receive any care at all) 

So yeah, when I say conservative, I mean support of those things. It’s not just a shot at the GOP (although they are all bad ppl). Joe Brandon, every Democrat senator, and 95% of democrats in the House of Representative are on board with the conservative agenda. And it’s all made possible by us buying the bullshit narratives that they’re selling. We need to spend $900+ billion on the military enemies will attack us here (not true). We need the top 10% to be filthy rich, cause if you work hard you’ll become one of them (not true). We can’t afford universal healthcare (lol not true).
The filthy pigs who rule over us have a clear agenda, both with foreign policy and domestic policy. In my opinion, if you’re willing to just shrug your shoulders and go along with it, that’s the conservative position. I understand that this definition won’t sit well with many of you, and that’s fine, I just wanted to clear up any confusion ✌️",,2334,"{'like_count': 2256, 'comment_count': 78, 'num_users': 82021}",WORST,,2023-10-21 17:23:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/13113875_951124751667998_172625598_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=b3yAI1ZBuWYAX8NE2H8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC8YadFd7WpsYmVixPV3twcCjZZ7tMDo6gtB2ipRaYJPw&oe=6559FA20,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyq0p31Ljqb/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394343102_739555531330607_485263463112362487_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nQQ9Buq2u9MAX9bC3vi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBUaKJl2KEgNAJ-RAsAjHYH9Ue7HWIJyj8mt7j_IgYSjg&oe=6559B6CE

instagram,"York University has issued a warning: if the institution’s student unions do not recant or sufficiently defend their collective statement on the Israel-Hamas conflict, they will risk losing their relationship with the university.

The university’s statement, released to the public on Friday, addressed the “serious and ongoing harms caused by [the groups’] statement,” which declares “solidarity with the Palestinian people” against “the settler-colonial apartheid state of so-called Israel.”

“Since 1948, Palestinian people have been systemically displaced from their land and homes as a result of state-sanctioned violence, siege, and genocide,” reads the student unions’ statement in part. “Our Unions remain unwavering in our support of the Palestinian people's fight for self-determination and liberation.”

In its statement, York University said the unions must retract the statement, issue an apology, acknowledge the impact of the statement on campus, and remove all union executives by 5 p.m. on Oct. 25.

Alternatively, the university said the student unions can challenge the assertion that the statement breached York’s Regulation Regarding Student Organizations by the same deadline.

instagram,"Teenagers' natural curiosity and eagerness to learn are essential for their personal growth as they challenge norms and shape their beliefs. Parents and teachers should encourage their questions and create a supportive environment. Conflict between parents can lead to emotional harm in children if their inquiries are met with aggression. A strong parent-child relationship is crucial to shield children from negative influences. Parents should explain complex topics in an age-appropriate manner when their children show curiosity.

instagram,"You might think this is a no-brainer—obviously you’d speak up in favor of Sam, the candidate you think is the most qualified! But wait. Not so fast. You would after all be going against the grain. Your colleagues are all pretty enthusiastic about Robin. Are you *sure* Sam is the right choice? And even if you are certain Sam is the way to go, it could be a bit uncomfortable to challenge the group. Is it worth it? 🤔

An interesting psychological study found that in an experiment setting with only two candidates — Sam and Robin — participants were reluctant to speak up and more likely to passively let Robin be hired. But wait, what about that third candidate, Taylor? While Taylor might not be the most skilled candidate, floating their name in the discussion can make a crucial difference. In fact, the study found that in a setting where one person on the hiring team made a case for Taylor, this significantly increased the likelihood of participants advocating for Sam, the most promising candidate!

But why does one person speaking up in favor of Taylor have such an impact? It’s because throwing a minority opinion into the mix breaks up groupthink and pushes every member of the group to assess the situation for themselves. In other words, this challenges the group’s tendency to avoid conflict at all costs — and often leads to better decision-making! 🚀

Would you like to learn more about strategies for encouraging independent thinking, and why nonconformity is a strength we should nurture? Then we think you’ll like the Blink to “Originals” by author and organizational psychologist @adamgrant. In it, you’ll learn more about this experiment, but also about how Isaac Newton and Picasso came up with their most groundbreaking ideas! 💥",,1702,"{'like_count': 1683, 'comment_count': 19, 'num_users': 439164}",Blinkist,,2023-10-21 08:00:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/194261178_834119110537698_7042370822767272167_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=eMkprUl7HS8AX-q5-ut&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDPmW65NhIogqW2ey_I6k_YKZ1o8ZGSH7brHriqotmVdA&oe=655ABCC1,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyp0Mazs26o/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/393525868_6660877457327039_4082507088007375266_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=i5Fb5PbsOSQAX9dBFQy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCDLgfR_SLkRazc63Z8D89njU-eW8W2dhUkS55FRyr5Jg&oe=65598AB9
instagram,"The Cycle of Life
-
The personality consists of the transitory vehicles through which the Thinker energizes in the Physical, Astral, and lower Mental worlds, and of all the activities connected with these. These are bound together by the links of memory caused by impressions made on the three lower bodies; and, by the self-identification of the Thinker with his vehicles, the personal ""I"" is set up. The personality, with its transient feelings, desires, passions, thus forms a quasi-independent entity, though drawing all its energies from the Thinker it enwraps, and as its qualifications, belonging to the lower worlds, are often in direct antagonism to the permanent interests of the ""Dweller in the body,"" conflict is set up in which victory inclines sometimes to the temporary pleasure, sometimes to the permanent gain.
-
The individuality consists of the Thinker himself, the immortal tree that puts out all these personalities as leaves, to last through the spring, summer, and autumn of human life. All that the leaves take in and assimilate enriches the sap that courses through their veins, and in the autumn this is withdrawn into the parent trunk, and the dry leaf falls and perishes. The Thinker alone lives forever; he is the man for whom ""the hour never strikes,"" the eternal youth who, as the Bhagavad Gita has it, puts on and casts off bodies as a man puts on new garments and throws off the old. Each personality is a new part for the immortal Actor, and he treads the stage of life over and over again, only in the life-drama each character he assumes is the child of the preceding ones and the father of those to come, so that the life-drama is a continuous history, the history of the Actor who plays the successive parts.

instagram,"In a powerful display of unity, both supporters and players observed a moment of silence ahead of Liverpool's match against Everton today, as a tribute to those impacted by the Israel-Palestine war. 

In addition to the solemn moment, players, managers, and match officials at Anfield adorned black armbands. This gesture of solidarity will be repeated at all Premier League and English Football League matches throughout the weekend.

Liverpool's forward, Mohamed Salah, who hails from Egypt, recently called for an end to the ongoing conflict. Using his significant public platform, he urged world leaders to unite and work towards preventing further loss of innocent lives.

  The recent events in Palestine have deeply saddened us, and it's crucial to stand up against any form of violence and oppression. 

 We stand with those affected by the conflict and believe in the importance of raising awareness and supporting humanitarian efforts. We encourage everyone to educate themselves about the situation, listen to the voices of those affected, and take action in any way they can. 

Let's create a world where everyone can thrive, regardless of their background or beliefs. Together, we can make a difference.

instagram,"This is a very difficult time – we can help each other

The situation is tense in the region. Our thoughts are with the people suffering and most affected. 

We are witnessing horrific suffering of innocent lives, the disappearance of humanity.

We are sad, we are stressed, we are scared - mostly we feel helpless. Each hour that goes by brings a possibility of conflict spilling over.

In four years we suffered through economic crisis, nationwide protests, shortage of food, electricity, fuel, medication, hyperinflation. Coronavirus. Terrible Beirut explosion. More protests, a full year with no government. Many went through the 2006 war and helped animals. We did not imagine we would reach this level of atrocities.

We have to be strong – not for us but for the animals that depend on us. We have over 100 cats and dogs, two young lions, six baboons, and other wildlife we are working on. Lions scheduled to leave to a sanctuary in South Africa, baboons to a sanctuary in the UK, cats and dogs to various countries. These trips are now at risk and we fear they might be stuck.

We are now receiving dozens of requests per day for help with people leaving Lebanon with their pets. We are helping make sure they have the right documents and permits, buy traveling cages, making flight reservations, or updating veterinary records so they are prepared in case they need to leave suddenly. You can check the travel guidelines in our previous post.

We are trying to build up a three-to-six-month supply for our own animals and so we can help the community.

We have to be prepared in case the situation gets worse.

instagram,"Renowned American-Pakistani singer, Momina Mustehsan tweeted about the Palestine-Israel conflict in a neutral tone. Twitteratis have since been bashing her for her stance and not blatantly speaking out against Israel and their oppression. Many think that she has kept her stance neutral due to her American nationality and fear of losing work. Some compared her with the Palestinian-American model Bella Hadid, praising Hadid for being outspoken and sticking to the truth without caring for contracts she will lose.

instagram,"The separation of the Masculine and Feminine has created a lot of manipulation, suppression, and control between the external expressions of these energies.

The key to healing the conflict is for each of us to balance out our internal energies.

This means that the Core Masculine must learn to connect to his own intuition, soul, and his emotional body, instead of looking to an external Feminine energy to do these things for him.

When the Masculine has learned to listen  to his own inner voice and honor his own emotions, he then is able to unite with his Divine Feminine.

The inner union comes first.

For years, efforts to neutralize the threat from the Safer had come up empty — because of the war, disagreements over how the oil should be secured and struggles to raise funding. A renewed effort in 2020 proposed to transfer the oil off the ship to another tanker, rather than securing it in place.

The complex initiative required the purchase of an oil tanker, the hiring of a salvage company and coordination between bitter foes on opposite sides of Yemen’s conflict.

instagram,"🔥 How to Handle the ""Condemn Hamas"" Question 🇵🇸

In the midst of the complex and heart-wrenching situation in Palestine and Gaza, you might find yourself faced with the challenging question: ""Do you condemn Hamas?"" Here's what you need to know and how to respond:

1. **Stay Informed**: Start by understanding the context and the situation on the ground. Knowledge is power, and it will help you form a well-informed opinion.

2. **Refuse to be Cornered**: Don't allow yourself to be forced into a corner where you have to make an unfair choice. It's not black and white.

3. **No Rush to Judgment**: Avoid hasty condemnations. Without the full story and all the facts, it's unwise to pass judgment on complex issues.

4. **Principled Stand**: You can be critical of actions and policies without endorsing terrorism. Make it clear that you stand for peace, human rights, and justice.

5. **Question the Question**: Challenge the framing of the question. It's often a trap, designed to oversimplify a multifaceted conflict.

6. **Educate and Advocate**: Use this as an opportunity to raise awareness about the larger issues at hand - the rights and lives of those affected by the conflict.

7. **Engage in Dialogue**: Encourage open, respectful dialogue to foster understanding, even with those who may have different perspectives.

Remember, it's vital to address the situation in Gaza with compassion, empathy, and a commitment to peace.

instagram,"🎉 New Affiliate Project: The Papua New Guinea Manta Project 🇵🇬

We are thrilled to introduce our latest affiliate project, The Papua New Guinea Manta Project (PNGMP)! 🇵🇬

🌊 Their aim is to better understand the population dynamics of manta and devil rays throughout the Milne Bay Province and across Papua New Guinea region, in order to support local capacity building by working hand-in-hand with local NGOs throughout the region. 

🏆 Their current achievements include: conducting ongoing training and field trips with the Sea Women of Melanesia and collaborated with the Coral Sea Foundation to incorporate valuable manta research into their programme. They also conducted a feasibility study in partnership with the Manta Trust and the Conflict Islands Conservation Initiative to increase the knowledge of the manta rays in this remote biodiversity hotspot. 

🤿 This project was established by project leader, Dr. Annie Murray. She aims to learn more about this understudied population of manta rays, building on previous research conducted in the region to answer the many questions regarding their population dynamics and population movements, whilst maintaining a strong focus on supporting local researchers and communities.

💙 Thank you to all those who have supported and donated to the project, with a special thanks to @sandrinapostorino !

instagram,"Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Leo starts with an acknowledgment that it’s inspired by A History of Violence (2005), the David Cronenberg action thriller based on John Wagner’s graphic novel of the same title. The story of a seemingly peaceful man with a secret, violent history is common enough. The contrast between the characters allows for a cinematic explosion of heroism, a high you experience even if you were expecting it all along. What makes these stories about ‘bad boys turned good’ fascinating is their internal conflict and how they confront the shadows of the past that catch up with them eventually.

Leo’s Parthiban, an animal rescuer, leads a perfect life – a loving wife (Trisha), a son with whom he shares a friendly rapport (Matthew Thomas), and a daughter who adores him (Iyal). When an incident at his restaurant brings back ghosts from his past, he goes all out to protect his family. Lokesh says he is a man who is capable of much love and tenderness. Can he really be a killer?

Psychological state and  mental health during the war  are extremely important. 
Many people suffer from  devastation, feelings of hopelessness,  anxiety and panic . Rise in ED
Behaviours. Many people feel anxious while watching the news when horrible and inhumane events occur. 

We request Eating Disorder and Mental Health Organizations to offer crisis trauma, emotional and practical support to individuals, families and anyone affected by war.

instagram,"What Happened:  An Egyptian woman questions the Western media's hypocrisy on Palestine. She asked them why they were not reporting what was happening in Palestine.

Opinion: The question of why Western media sometimes fails to provide comprehensive and balanced reporting on the Palestinian issue is something to consider. Why do they keep protecting what Israel is doing, and why are they justifying it?

The ongoing situation in Gaza has raised concerns about the humanitarian crisis and its impact on civilians in the region. The disruption of the Rafah crossing, along with the broader conflict, has prompted international calls for the protection of civilians and adherence to humanitarian law. It underscores the urgency of addressing the long-standing issues in the region and the need for a peaceful resolution for Palestinians.

instagram,"Addressing a Cairo summit as the conflict raged into its third week, Guterres said the Palestinian enclave of 2.4 million people was living through “a humanitarian catastrophe” with thousands dead and more than a million displaced.

“We meet in the heart of a region that is reeling in pain and one step from the precipice,” he told the meeting that included the leaders of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates as well as of Italy and Spain and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.

The bloodshed began on October 7 when Hamas militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, launching an attack that has killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, in the deadliest attack on Israeli soil since the state was founded in 1948.

Israel has hit back with a relentless bombing campaign, killing more than 4,300 Palestinians, mainly civilians according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.

Guterres said “the grievances of the Palestinian people are legitimate and long” after “56 years of occupation with no end in sight” but stressed that “nothing can justify the reprehensible assault by Hamas that terrorised Israeli civilians”.

Hukum ini melindungi mereka yang tidak atau tidak lagi terlibat dalam pertikaian, dan membatasi cara-cara dan metode berperang. Hukum Humaniter Internasional adalah istilah lain dari hukum perang (laws of war) dan hukum konflik bersenjata (laws of armed conflict).

Hukum humaniter ini diciptakan tidak dimaksudkan untuk melarang perang, atau untuk mengadakan undang-undang yang menentukan permainan ""perang"", tetapi karena alasan-alasan perikemanusiaan untuk mengurangi atau membatasi penderitaan individu-individu dan untuk membatasi wilayah dimana kebuasan konflik bersenjata diperbolehkan.

instagram,"Roman-era mosaic is uncovered during the excavation of an old building in Syria .

RASTAN, Syria —in 2022 Syria uncovered a large intact mosaic that dates back to the Roman era, describing it Wednesday as the most important archaeological discovery since the country's conflict began 11 years ago.

Journalists were shown the mosaic in the central town of Rastan near Homs, Syria's third largest city.

The mosaic, at 120 square meters (around 1,300 square feet), was found in an old building that Syria's General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums had been excavating.

Lebanese and Syrian businessmen from the neighboring country's Nabu Museum bought the property that dates back to the 4th century and donated it to the Syrian state.

Each panel was filled with square-shaped, small colorful stones measuring about half an inch on each side.

Dr. Humam Saad, the associate director of excavation and archaeological research at the directorate, said among the scenes the mosaic shows is a rare portrayal of Ancient Amazon warriors in Roman mythology.

""What is in front of us is a discovery that is rare on a global scale,"" Saad told The Associated Press, adding that the images are ""rich in details,"" and includes scenes from the Trojan War between the Greeks and Trojans.

In Ancient Greek and Roman mythology, demigod hero Hercules slayed Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, in one of his 12 labors.

instagram,"As 20 aid trucks arrived at a UN storage facility in central Gaza on Saturday, October 21, uncertainty loomed for the 2.3 million people still blockaded there.

It’s been two weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing close to 1,400 people in coordinated attacks that prompted devastating Israeli retaliation and increased tensions around the world. 

Israel said it would its increase strikes on Gaza, starting Saturday.

Hamas is holding as many as 200 hostages it kidnapped during the attacks, and says 50 more captives are being held by other armed groups inside Gaza.

Hamas previously said 20 hostages were killed by Israeli air strikes, without providing details.

Two American hostages were released by Hamas Friday and handed over to Israeli authorities after Qatar helped mediate their release. 

In addition to Israeli hostages, Hamas is also holding citizens of Thailand, Argentina, Britain, Germany, France and Portugal.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed ‘mighty vengeance’ for the Oct. 7 massacre. A ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces could come at any time. 

More than 4300 Palestinian people, including women and children, have been killed in the retaliatory attacks.

Demonstrations around the world show deep divisions in communities supporting Palestinian and Israeli civilians.

The U.S. has affirmed support for Israel’s right to defend itself, but officials have expressed doubt that Israel has crafted an endgame to the conflict that threatens to draw in other countries and divide the world.

Arab leaders at a Cairo summit on Saturday condemned the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. With Israel and the U.S. absent from the summit, no agreement was made toward how to contain the violence.

Gulf Cooperation Council and ASEAN countries called for a durable ceasefire, the immediate release of civilian hostages and detainees, and a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

China’s special envoy on Middle East affairs has also called for efforts to implement a two-state solution and promote an early, comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question.

instagram,"22 journalists killed since H~mas-Israel conflict erupted

New York, Oct 21: The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based nonprofit, has said that at least 22 journalists have been killed since the H~mas launched its massive assault on !srael on October 7.

In a report released on Friday, the CPJ said that it is investigating all reports of journalists killed, injured, detained, or missing in the raging conflict, including those hurt as hostilities spread to neighboring Leban0n.

“As of October 20, at least 22 journalists were among the more than 4,000 dead on both sides since the war began on October 7, with hundreds killed in Tuesday’s hospital blast in Ga~a,” it said.

“Journalists in Ga~a face particularly high risks as they try to cover the conflict in the face of a ground assault by Israel! troops, devastating Israel! airstrikes, disrupted communications, and extensive power outages.”

Of the 22 slain journalists, 18 were Palest!n!an, three Israel!s and one Lebanese.

While eight reporters were injured, three others have been reportedly missing or detained.

The CPJ said that it was probing “numerous unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt or threatened, and of damage to media offices and journalists’ homes”.

“CPJ emphasizes that journalists are civilians doing important work during times of crisis and must not be targeted by warring parties,” said Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator.

“Journalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heartbreaking conflict. All parties must take steps to ensure their safety.”

The nonprofit stressed that it remained unclear whether all of the slain journalists were covering the conflict at the time of their deaths.–(IANS)",,815,"{'like_count': 809, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 85503}",KASHMIR NEWS 24X7®,,2023-10-21 11:19:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/268125407_662939014865838_3191813339446247991_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=lz-uHEDDuY0AX9LCna9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDg91lsArMlVGhHQPC1-UEQuLkQb4ViqcUSsgRD9Gu7hg&oe=6559BE86,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyqLCj_ye1l/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393736635_321090050545262_3199492232175943557_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=hMpaiDovHQgAX8-WLBj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBRK1xyygOUlbL-lVRuavphQKxrRt1vu944dKA3p6pXVQ&oe=653C482C

These pro-Palestinian protests. Something I would like to say about that is, whatever side you're on in regards to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, all the power to you. But this is not about Israel-Palestine. This is about Hamas, a terrorist organization who is just as complicit in the deaths of these innocent Palestinians as they are in the deaths of innocent Israelis.""

Natalie said this is not about Israel vs. Palestine. This is about a terrorist organization attacking the Jews and killing innocent people, killing innocent people at a music festival, killing innocent grandmas who survived the Holocaust, just to be killed by Hamas, burning babies alive.

“The amount of antisemitism I've seen in videos since coming back to New York, antisemitism all over Europe and the United States, that scares me more than anything. For so long, as a Jew growing up in America, you're always taught about the Holocaust, and you're taught about the way our people were treated and the way so many people just stood by and watched as the Holocaust happened. And you're taught to never forget. And my whole life, I tried to understand how could — how could the world stand by? How could the world stand by and let that happen? And it's sad to say that I'm now starting to realize how. And I don't feel safe."" 

The security at the festival was very tight, something her three friends who were there with her were accustomed to. But they woke up to the sounds of rockets. They ran as far as they could away from the festival.

A group of people encouraged her friends to join them in hiding in a ditch, but they declined, fearing that if terrorists were to arrive, they'd have no way out. She later learned that those who stayed there had all been killed.

They were eventually picked up by a local man from the town Patish, who left the security of his town and drove toward the terrorists. 

“He risked his own life to try to save our lives."" He went back to get more people.

As many as ""12,000 displaced people, including 70% children and women, are in imminent danger after Israeli forces threatened to bomb Al-Quds Hospital and demanded evacuation,"" the humanitarian organization said on X.

""This place could turn to ashes if those threats are carried out.""

""Is there a world power capable of stopping the threats of the Israeli occupation army to bomb hospitals with innocent civilians inside?"" the PRCS said.

It called on the international community to ""act urgently"" to avert ""another catastrophe like Al-Ahli Hospital.""

At least 471 people were killed and many others injured in the Israeli airstrike on Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital earlier this week, according to health officials in Gaza. Israel, however, denied responsibility for the air raid.

The ongoing deadly conflict began Oct. 7 when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood -- a multi-pronged surprise attack that included a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel by land, sea and air.

Hamas said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers.

The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.

In addition to launching a sweeping bombardment campaign ahead of an expected ground invasion, Israel ordered a ""full siege"" on Gaza that has led to electricity supplies being severed as water, food, fuel and medical supplies run out.

Hamas said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers.

The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.

In addition to launching a sweeping bombardment campaign ahead of an expected ground invasion, Israel ordered a ""full siege"" on Gaza that has led to electricity supplies being severed as water, food, fuel and medical supplies run out.

instagram,"“Approach plugged culvert as a water problem, not a beaver problem.” -Former MDIFW Wildlife Technician, Jim Dorso

When humans see a road with a culvert in a wetland, they see a path across, but a beaver sees a dam with a leak. Plugged culverts are the most common conflict with beavers.

Simply removing a beaver would only be a temporary fix until another beaver comes along to use the same habitat and fix the same leak. Removal of beaver would also eliminate an integral component of healthy aquatic ecosystems. Beavers are ecosystem engineers whose behavior modifies habitat, creating space and resources for countless other species.

Site modification is an alternative approach which produces long-term and cost-effective solutions for chronic problems by simultaneously addressing current conflict and minimizing future conflict, all while preserving quality wetland habitat produced by beavers.

Seen here, MDIFW and USDA biologists train @university.of.maine students in the implementation of a site modification device known as a beaver deceiver. This device denies access to culverts which maintains normal water flow and eliminates the need for constant maintenance. It also encourages dam placement upstream from the culvert and maintains a water level that is acceptable for both humans and beavers. Everybody wins!

I haven’t been very vocal or active on social media recently, but while I did my best to avoid conflict, it found me.

𝗟𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗜 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝗗𝗠 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗮𝗶𝗱: “𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙖 𝙕𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙞𝙨𝙩? 𝙄’𝙢 𝙢𝙖𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖 𝙡𝙞𝙨𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙖𝙪𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙥𝙧𝙤 𝙜𝙚𝙣𝙤𝙘𝙞𝙙𝙚”

I did not engage with this person and immediately blocked/reported them. But after letting their message sync in I can’t be silent anymore.

Being a Zionist means believing that Israel should 𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡. 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗶𝘁. It doesn’t mean you agree with their government just like being an American doesn’t mean you agree with our government. I’m sick of people being villainized for using this word bc if you don’t think Israel should exist then you might as well say Jews shouldn’t exist. 

But I’m not even here to address their question bc it’s offensive and ridiculous. What concerns me the most is that someone I don’t know reached out to me solely because I’m Jewish and basically threatened to put me on a list. 

A list for what? Is my name now floating around as a precaution to readers? Are my books being banned bc they mention latkes and matzah ball soup? Will this post get me on more lists? Probably 🤷🏻‍♀️

If it really needs to be stated, I’m horrified by what’s happening in Israel and Gaza. Loss of life from any nation, religion or ethnic group is devastating. But why have we turned their conflict into our own? Why are so many people using this as a way to spread more hate and more violence? 

If you have felt the need to send a DM like the one I got last night, or to “make a statement” about a war happening across the world, I implore you to ask yourself why. And to think about the repercussions of your actions.

instagram,"'I was greatly tempted by Sam Leith’s suggestion in a column on The Spectator’s website this week that we should all shut up about Israel and Palestine because we don’t know what we’re talking about. Certainly the crisis there has made London dinner parties almost unendurable – and it is true that as soon as anyone brings up Sykes-Picot, which they always do, I begin to choke on my baba ganoush and start demanding that the host open another bottle of Fairtrade Palestinian pinot noir. But then I thought that if in future I wrote about only those things of which I have a perfect understanding, pace Wittgenstein, I’d be well and truly buggered as a columnist. 

'Old Ludwig didn’t think about that, did he? A lack of expertise has never stopped me weighing in with a jiffy bag of bile on every subject under the sun and I don’t see why Jews and Arabs should be exempt. Further, while I daresay my understanding of Middle Eastern politics is woefully incomplete, I have always tended to be on the side of civilisation when it is opposed by medieval barbarity. In making this choice, I consider myself progressive as well as – Ludwig, take note – both logical and positive. 

'This article is not about Israel and Palestine, as it happens, but about the way in which the narrative regarding that conflict is being carefully marshalled by our institutions. The BBC, with its – on the face of it – hilarious decision not to call Hamas ‘terrorists’, you will be well aware of; much as you will of the entirely justified protest outside New Broadcasting House. But the hi-tech social media giants are another issue entirely. I know you know this, but we have to keep an eye on these bastards, remembering their gleeful distortion of the narrative during the last US presidential election: the deliberate suppression of stories that might be damaging to the Biden campaign and finally the removal of the then president from all social media outlets so that he no longer had a voice. If they do that to presidents, what might they do to the rest of us?'

instagram,"It’s been a very somber last week in parliament. It’s not just the suffering and dying in war zones that sickens and terrifies me, it’s what is born there. Seeds are sown for more conflict, more cruelty, more suffering, for generations to come. That’s why war and violence is never the answer. I felt this strongly when I visited the battlefields of World War 1. A lingering sense of evil - the only time in my life I’d use this word as a best description. Seems we never learn the lessons of history. If you are a 16 year old in #gaza you have now seen 6 wars in your short life. That’s desperately sad, and a warning to us all about how intractable this conflict has become. A conflict that could not only draw in other middle eastern powers (as has been the case 5 times over the past 75 years) but risks becoming global. The Greens are a party of peace and non violence, that’s one big reason I joined them. We condemn all violence, war crimes, especially against civilians in wars. By anyone- we don’t take sides on this principle. There has to be a better way forward to end the seemingly endless impasse of violence, occupation, suffering, war crimes - rather than the expected wholesale destruction of a city that has millions of occupants, 40% of them children. Binary ‘with us or against us’ political messaging is offensive and should be rejected, and makes more bloodshed inevitable, today and into the future. ‘Peace through superior firepower’ as a paradigm has obviously not secured a lasting peace for Israel. Where does it end? I’ll continue to share important updates to my story from the @unitednations and other trusted information sources on this unfolding human catastrophe in and around Gaza, and what you can do. As much as it’s understandable- human nature to turn away when it all becomes too much for us to see, bear, we simply can’t. There is way too much at stake, we need to call for a ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and peace talks that offer hope for long term resolutions. #palestine #israel",,701,"{'like_count': 646, 'comment_count': 55, 'num_users': 17483}",Senator Pete Whish-Wilson,,2023-10-21 00:02:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/274156466_993773918243958_3124177652609104908_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=rIVpjEJ6JgQAX80S6uV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCR8Gq2vN6xI9t9bw2mogTmshYYAp6oJvuMgzjh4H6kKQ&oe=655AAA18,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyo9em-vnsg/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393457817_1669202593567062_5908991032137344338_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=DH_1aWSmk90AX-HAriK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBzZZIZRujrMA4E7zwD6Qgfq20JNvf_QVCsJH9BJ7vNow&oe=6559D307

instagram,"New york [First US gigs]

#repost #aurora.puppet

Another post from the very beginning of AURORA's career, her first gigs in the US. On October 21 2014 she performed at the CMJ Music Marathon at the Rockwood Music Hall in New York. Later that night she performed at the Conflict of Interest Party at the Brooklyn Bowl. I love how expressive these photos are!

Bob Boilen from NPR had this to say about his first impression of Aurora:

""I'm Aurora, I'm from Norway, I'm eighteen years old, so really I'm not allowed here."" That's how Aurora Aksnes introduced herself to a packed Rockwood Music Hall. The petite singer with a lilting voice and a melodic pop sensibility is certainly someone I look forward to hearing more of in the coming year.  

The set list is not known in detail, but we know she (at least) performed the following songs.

Awakening
Running With the Wolves
We Were Going To Do That
Under Stars 
Life On Mars

Did any of my followers see her at these gigs? Let me know in the comments!

instagram,"The first humanitarian aid convoy to be sent to the besieged Gaza Strip since war broke out there began moving through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt on Saturday after days of diplomatic wrangling over conditions for delivering the relief.

The United Nations said the 20-truck convoy included life-saving supplies that would be received by the Palestinian Red Crescent. Palestinian group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said the delivery included medicine and limited amounts of food.

Rafah is the main route in and out of the Gaza Strip that is not controlled by Israel, and the focus of efforts to deliver aid to Gaza's 2.3 million residents.

U.N. officials say at least 100 trucks a day are needed in Gaza to cover urgent needs, and that any delivery of aid needs to be sustained and at scale. Before the outbreak of conflict, an average of about 450 aid trucks were arriving there daily.

instagram,"Kaala Paani gets one thing so well - any story set in the middle of a crisis outbreak, becomes a map built of many human stories. The general conflict is between human survival or loss, and that rests on the smaller stories of individual characters we care for. Every larger human debate plays out in the intimacy of a few individuals.

Set in the middle of a rare illness outbreak in the Andaman islands, Kaala Paani does something similar by intricately threading many such stories - there are the individuals representing the medical side grappling with the crisis, which has its own conflicts of who stands up for the fight, who is more caught up with selfish concerns (Mona Singh stands out with a role that is brief but throws huge shadows of her presence through every episode). 

There's the side of civilians, which always makes for the most heartbreaking stories - made up of separations, searches, loss, they are the heart of the story. I was incredibly moved by the story of Santosh and Gargi's family - the third episode made me tear up, even the name of the third episode has such a powerful reveal later when you realise it. 

Like the best such stories, Kaala Paani doesn't sensationalize these stories but humanizes them through various perspectives. Strongly recommended it!

instagram,"Disclaimer, this is about relationships with normal, day to day issues and misunderstandings. This is not about accepting abusive behavior. That’s a different story.

When you’re married or in a committed relationship, there’s always going to be disagreements, differing opinions, and conflict. It’s natural because we all have our own set of beliefs, and problems. 

When these conflicts and issues occur, don’t start looking at other women, or ladies, don’t start looking at other men and think “he would be so much better for me, my man is a jerk. Or for the men, “she would treat me better than my girl, my girl is just a bitch”. Remember, they also have their own issues, character flaws, and difficulties.

Stop looking at “someone else” through rose colored glasses because you’re going through a rough patch in your marriage or relationship. And start looking at your partner with rose colored glasses. Find the beauty in them, and the reasons you chose them. 

Because to be married, or in a relationship is really just choosing one persons flaws over everyone else’s. You may be exchanging someone with issues you can live, for someone whose issues may destroy you mentally and emotionally.

Don’t do something stupid now that you may very well regret later.

Therefore, If you’re going to look at anyone through rose colored glasses, make it your partner. 

We all have issues, we all have problems, and we all have insecurities, none of us are perfect. Don’t expect your partner to be.

instagram,"Parts Unknown - Season 2, Episode 1: “Jerusalem”

The central subjects of Anthony Bourdain’s programs increasingly shifted from highlighting world cuisines to the people and cultural conflicts across our globe — stories that he felt a profound responsibility to tell, but also took an enormous toll on his personal struggles in a way that is now soberingly obvious. But these programs were also an enormous contribution to humanity, providing a way for many of us to attempt to understand other parts of our world and empathize with humanity's struggles. And that feels a particular imperative today. 

As Bourdain put it: ""One can be forgiven for thinking, when you see how similar they are, the two peoples, both of them cook with pride, eat with passion, love their kids, love the land in which they live or the land they dream of returning to, who live so close, who are locked in such an intimate, if deadly embrace, might somehow, some day, figure out how to live with each other. But that would be very mushy thinking indeed. Those things in the end probably don't count for much at all.""

Goodness, do these words sting ever more acutely with the reality of this conflict just 10 years later.

In no way will we attempt to explain or make sense of this terrible conflict that we are witnessing in the middle east. But we do recommend taking 43 minutes to watch this short episode as we did this morning.

instagram,"What happened: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip on October 20, 2023, in an effort to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinian enclave.

Details: During his visit, Guterres engaged with various parties, including Egypt, Israel, and the United States, to expedite the movement of aid trucks into Gaza. The exact timeline for the delivery of relief materials stockpiled in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula remained uncertain at the time of his visit. Guterres emphasized the importance of swift and sustained aid delivery, characterizing these trucks as a lifeline and a matter of life and death for the people in Gaza. The international community is actively working to make this happen despite the challenges posed by the conflict and the need for secure and effective aid distribution, he added.

What you need to know: The situation in Gaza is dire, with most of its 2.3 million inhabitants heavily reliant on humanitarian aid due to a longstanding blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since 2007. Before the recent conflict, around 450 aid trucks were entering Gaza daily, but the situation deteriorated following the hostilities between Israel and Hamas. Efforts are ongoing to ensure a substantial and sustainable aid operation to address the urgent needs of Gaza's people.

instagram,"(VF ci-dessous) #PALESTINEISRAELWAR: “I evacuated my home in Gaza City last night” said RSF’s correspondent a week into the conflict. “I'm having trouble talking to you. We barely have any Internet here and we can't charge our phones. I am doing my best to gather information. We live in fear, it's unbearable. This is not the first war I’ve covered in Gaza, but I have never seen anything like this.”

During the “bloody week” following the massacre of Israeli civilians by Hamas, 10 journalists were killed in connection with their work – 8 of them in Gaza and most if not all of them as a result of Israeli bombardments. The latest victim is Mohammad Baalouche, the director of @paltodaytv.

The Israeli armed forces have been doing everything possible to prevent the dissemination of images. We condemn the media blackout that Israel is trying to impose. Journalism is the antidote to the disinformation that is spreading with particular strength with regard to this region.

#GUERREPALESTINEISRAEL : “J’ai évacué ma maison à Gaza City hier soir. J’ai du mal à vous parler. Nous n'avons pratiquement pas d'Internet ici et nous ne pouvons pas recharger nos téléphones. Je fais de mon mieux pour recueillir des informations."" déclare la correspondante de RSF une semaine après le début du conflit. ""Nous vivons dans la peur, c'est insupportable. Ce n'est pas la première guerre que je couvre à Gaza, mais je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel.”

Lors de la semaine “sanglante” suivant le massacre de civils israéliens par le Hamas, 10 journalistes ont été tués dans l’exercice de leur métier, dont 8 à Gaza, la plupart, sinon tous, sous les bombardements israéliens. Le dernier en date est le journaliste Mohammad Baalouche, directeur de @paltodaytv.

Les forces armées israéliennes font tout pour empêcher la diffusion d’images. Nous dénonçons ce blackout médiatique qu’Israël tente d'imposer. Le journalisme est l’antidote à la désinformation, qui se propage de manière particulièrement forte à propos de la région.

Follow LeRon, go to his Linktree to read his entire piece 🙏🏽

“Black American and Palestinian solidarity is not only rooted in struggle but hope, fighting, resilience, laughter, endless battling, sadness, and doing it all over again the next day. This is what I see for my Palestinian brothers and sisters trying to hold on to a land that does everything it can to make them let go.

This is why I cry for the deaths of Palestinian and Israeli people. This is why I do not refer to it as ""The Conflict,"" but as ""The Occupation."" This why I have hope for and will continue to support Palestine as they fight to be recognized as people, human beings that deserve freedom and equal treatment as their Israeli neighbors, just as I, a Black man, will continue to fight for the freedom of my people in America. Our struggle is intertwined.

instagram,"“In a lot of ways, it was your use of the kishōtenketsu early on in your own work that served as a model for what a narrative can look like if conflict isn’t the crux of the narrative. What if the tension that exists in the narrative is simply the passage of time, or the proximity of characters to one another? Which is a little bit antagonistic to the way so many of us have been taught in white contemporary American literary fiction. But I think that in writing narratives featuring queer folks who are coming from marginalized communities, who among us is certain? Who among us feels as if we are the voice, or have the solution at any given moment? For these characters, for my own life, so much comes from the collective. On the level of prose, that meant trying to give as much credence to each speaker in the text as possible. If the motion is to try to paint a simulacrum of lived experience as possible on the page, trying to allow the community of voices and a communal arc felt as if it were more fitting not only for this particular narrative but for the characters I was circling around.” - Bryan Washington to Ocean Vuong on the structure of the narrative in his novel, Family Meal",,479,"{'like_count': 476, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 26957}",The Center for Fiction,,2023-10-21 19:40:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/375849969_593607502738990_1414522434943970716_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=X4fzGW3qlEgAX-ufaWs&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAjJJH02hBZOEdzswn14mSOX0AEm1dRDj5UmlFKQW7IDQ&oe=655B55A8,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyrETgxCp2o/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/394516862_638057565179009_4745227448311853429_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nAVQpMfMTewAX9TS_13&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAEJHl2JCm4t7fpgzWdtwObYZGDOzEuLQOXcLFhckUf9Q&oe=65522BF7
instagram,"Whitney Pocket Model Second Model Second Type in .31 Caliber with a 4” barrel 

The Whitney Pocket Model classification includes a variety of small caliber revolvers with the earliest one came on the scene around 1850, followed by a series of improved revolvers . As indicated by the name, these “pocket” revolvers were designed to be easily carried by civilians.  They are primarily .31 caliber revolvers, with a few models made in .28 caliber and they came with barrel lengths between 3”-6”. The Pocket models would also differ with their loading levers either being a ball type latch (like the one shown) or a Colt wedge style latch.

Whitney, and other firearms manufacturers struggled to produce reliable “revolvers” during the early 1850s with Sam Colt’s patent on his revolving mechanism did not expire until 1857.  Prior to that time, Whitney and others had to offer alternative methods of turning the cylinder.  After the patent expired, Whitney was ready with his .36 Navy Model revolver and a Pocket Model that closely resembled the Navy Model. Revolvers like the Pocket Model would’ve been bought privately during the American Civil War by troops on both sides of the conflict due to handguns not being fully standard issue for all troops.

instagram,"15 Palestinians, in new Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.

At least 15 Palestinians, including four children, were killed in renewed Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, the Gaza Interior Ministry said Saturday.

A statement said 10 were killed when Israeli fighter jets struck two houses in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.

And four children and a woman were killed in a separate strike on a house east of Rafah in southern Gaza, it said

The conflict in Gaza, under Israeli bombardment and blockade since Oct. 7, began when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood -- a multi-pronged surprise attack that included a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel by land, sea and air.

Hamas said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers.

The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, putting the territory's 2.3 million residents under total siege and a blockade of food, fuel and medical supplies

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged an ""immediate humanitarian cease-fire"" to ease the ""epic human suffering.""

At least 4,137 Palestinians, including 1,524 children and 1,000 women have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza.

instagram,"李显龙总理指出，以色列不能只为宣泄情绪而展开报复攻击，因为这反而会让自己陷入更糟糕的境地。

他也重申，通过谈判达成让巴勒斯坦人和以色列人和平共处、安全生活的两国方案，是打破暴力循环，实现持久和平的唯一可行途径。“如果以巴不朝这个方向努力，恐怕注定会经历世世代代的流血和悲剧。我认为双方都不希望发生这种情况。”

李总理应沙特阿拉伯王储穆罕默德邀请，从10月17日至20日进行访问。期间，他在利雅得出席首次召开的亚细安—海湾合作委员会（Gulf Cooperation Council，简称海合会）峰会，与两个地区的领导人讨论全球和区域局势，包括不断升级的以哈冲突。海合会成员为沙特、科威特、阿联酋、卡塔尔、巴林和阿曼。

李总理在结束四天行程前，接受随行媒体访问。他说，每当发生人道主义危机，总会引起国际社会关注，尤其当遭受苦难的是无辜平民、婴儿、儿童和年长者。以最近的以哈冲突为例，哈马斯10月7日对以色列发动恐怖袭击，杀害至少1300人，无论什么原因都无法为这种行为辩解，而新加坡也在第一时间谴责这样的可怕攻击。李总理说，面对突袭的以色列有权自卫以消除对自己的危险，而从人性的角度来看，以色列遭受如此严重和可怕的攻击后，不可能不采取行动。但他指出，以色列行使自卫权时，必须遵守国际法，包括战争法和国际人道主义法，减少平民伤亡，解决人道主义问题。📸：海峡时报

instagram,"A protest held by Moviment Graffitti is currently under way near Malta's Parliament, with the activists condemning the conflict in Gaza as they held a banner stating 'Palestine: A Homeland Denied'.

In a recent Facebook post, Moviment Graffitti wrote ""Palestinians in Gaza are being massacred by Israel while Europe complies. Non-stop bombardments have led to the brutal deaths of thousands of children, women and men. And Gaza is also dying of thirst, hunger and desparation after Isreal blocked the water, food and fuel supplies'.

The organisation stated that they planted themselves near Parliament in solidarity of the people in Gaza, ""victims of unimaginable atrocities.""

""Gaza is a strip of land as big as Malta, conerted into a prison by Israel in 2007. Around 2.5 million Palestinians inhabit it, a lot of them immigrants banished from their lands by force in 1948, when the Israel state was created,"" the post read.

Earlier today, first aid tracks began to enter Gaza through Rafah crossing, a crossing between Egypt and Gaza which was opened earlier today. Around 20 trucks carrying necessary resources include medicine, equipment and limited amounts of food have entered, with Hamas also reportedly releasing their first two hostages, a mother and a daughter.

instagram,"Roman-era mosaic is uncovered during the excavation of an old building in Syria .

RASTAN, Syria —in 2022 Syria uncovered a large intact mosaic that dates back to the Roman era, describing it Wednesday as the most important archaeological discovery since the country's conflict began 11 years ago.

Journalists were shown the mosaic in the central town of Rastan near Homs, Syria's third largest city.

The mosaic, at 120 square meters (around 1,300 square feet), was found in an old building that Syria's General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums had been excavating.

Lebanese and Syrian businessmen from the neighboring country's Nabu Museum bought the property that dates back to the 4th century and donated it to the Syrian state.

Each panel was filled with square-shaped, small colorful stones measuring about half an inch on each side.

Dr. Humam Saad, the associate director of excavation and archaeological research at the directorate, said among the scenes the mosaic shows is a rare portrayal of Ancient Amazon warriors in Roman mythology.

""What is in front of us is a discovery that is rare on a global scale,"" Saad told The Associated Press, adding that the images are ""rich in details,"" and includes scenes from the Trojan War between the Greeks and Trojans.

In Ancient Greek and Roman mythology, demigod hero Hercules slayed Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, in one of his 12 labors.

34 岁的泰国男子威塔瓦（Wittawat ""Jack"" Kunlawong）对媒体诉说生还过程。他说，他在距离加沙边境2公里处的一个养鸡场工作。当他正在工作时，哈马斯组织突袭并搜捕人员。他设法逃了出来，但不幸的是，他在逃离工作场所时遇到了一名哈马斯成员。他说：“他手中拿着一把刀，我试图去抢，而那人也试图反击；我被刺了数刀，最后我的喉咙被割破。他们还抢走了我身上所有的财物。”

威塔瓦说当时他失去了知觉，醒来时脖子上有一道严重的伤口。“我醒来后没看到任何袭击者，我想他们应该以为我死了，就把我扔在那里。”带着血淋淋的伤口，威塔瓦跑出现场求助。最后，他的朋友将他送往医院。在医院住了三天后，他才搭乘飞机返回泰国。威塔瓦的喉咙被严重割伤，登机后必须接受多项健康检查。

泰国皇家空军（RTAF）从以色列撤离了 136 名泰国人。威塔瓦 27 岁的妻子瓦萨娜（ Wassana Pimsuwan）和5岁的女儿在机场等他。他们紧紧拥抱在一起，喜极而泣。这是杰克四年前前往以色列后他们第一次见与家人团聚。瓦萨娜坚持不让丈夫再回以色列工作，他们计划一起在泰国从事农业工作。威塔瓦一直拥抱着女儿，不停地说他很高兴能回家。📸：泰国媒体Channel 3

🌻🌻🌻🌻

• REPOST from @sirianajanine “But why is a preschool teacher posting about Palestine? That’s so political.”

Kindly see yourself out, because you’re most likely a “progressive” person who doesn’t say this when I speak out against every other injustice that affects marginalized and oppressed peoples. 

The story of Palestine is the first injustice and struggle for liberation that I ever learned about. 🇵🇸 It’s what brought me to my work. 

In the past, Palestinians and their allies have been silenced and threatened for speaking out about the colonization of their land. 

In fact, until recently, people and governments would falsely call you antisemitic if you even said the name “Palestine”, and not “Palestinian territories.” This was intentionally meant to suppress solidarity and the truth about Palestine, while it also meant that antisemitism (a very present and dangerous form of bigotry against Jewish people) was misrepresented as criticizing Israel’s violent establishment and ethnic cleansing. 

And with so much false information and deflection that continues to frame Palestine as a “two-sided, complicated, religious conflict”, I had to speak out and share my lifetime of knowledge and research on the Palestinian struggle for justice. 

Please amplify Palestinian voices. Please listen to Jewish voices when they stand in solidarity and tell Israel to stop colonizing Palestine in the name of their religion. Israeli genocide does not represent Judaism. Justice for one is justice for all. 

I invite you to continue reading Palestinian stories and speaking with your children about Palestine, the way you do with all forms of racism and oppression. 

You are welcome to ask me questions to help you unlearn the anti-Palestinian and orientalist rhetoric we’ve all been taught. You are NOT welcome to attack me by falsely claiming my solidarity with Palestinians is antisemitic. 

There is hope. There is light. Freedom begins with knowledge.

While attraction plays a large role in the initial stages of falling in love, so do many other elements that are meaningful for long term connection. 

Make sure to look past the outer beauty to make sure the person is right for you.

Do they share similar values? How is their communication style? Do they run from conflict? Do they make you a better person?

instagram,"Hey everyone,
We're just over half way through the Ballinadee pumpkin patch and haunted bus and honestly we are so blown away by the response and the positive feedback from you all. To hear the sound of children running around laughing and playing, parents and adults mingling and enjoying themselves has made us want to make next year is even bigger and better.
With all that said the realisation of how lucky we are really hit. Seeing the recent flooding in East Cork and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the middle east. Seeing so many homes and businesses destroyed around Cork and watching innocent families and children killed or affected by the conflict in Palenstine & Isreal has made us reflect on what if anything we can do.
The goal of this year's pumpkin patch was to raise funds towards feeding and sheltering our rescues over the winter. However, after taking it over amongst ourselves we have decided the majority of any profit we make this year we will share amoung charities aiding in the response to the floods in East Cork and toward humanitarian aid in the middle east. While this is only a very small thing we can do we would ask anyone who is able to donate anything they can afford to the links we will continue to share on our page and stories. We'd also askto try and support businesses in east Cork over the coming Christmas season to help rebuild.

instagram,"I wasn't gonna post this. And then someone on threads said ""I have always respected you and your work. But the way you have responded to this humanitarian crisis, your bravery fills my heart with hope. Thank you for showing up with so much objectivity and compassion.""

First I burst into tears. And then I realised there are probably lots of ppl who like me, have always had a heart for 🇵🇸, but are only know begining to understand exactly what has been going on there for the last hundred years. 

I keep telling myself to stop posting about this stuff. Focus on weight stigma. They're gonna cancel your account again. Etc etc. But I just don't have it in me. So the slides are in alt text as well and if you're thinking tl;dr...

To sum up: 🇮🇱 is a settler-colonial state that has employed illegal tactics including ëthnic çlèånsing, apãrthëid and crimes against humanity to rid the land that it has occupied since 1948 (and extended in 1967) of its non Jewish population. The settler-colonial state is not to be confused with Israeli citizens, many of which were born there after 1967 and have not been complicit in these illegal acts (although one could argue that silence in the face of atrocities is complicity).

H@m@s have commited, and continue to commit crimes against humanity. They also believe in ridding the world (or at least the ""middle east"") of all Jews which is genercidal intent. However they currently lack the power or ability to enforce these intentions and whilst their attack on the 7th October was an act of terrorism and involved multiple crimes against humanity (one of which is ongoing with the ongoing hostage situation) it was not an act of genercide.

And finally, the 🇵🇸 people are innocent. Of this there is no question. We have a moral obligation to defend their rights to exist otherwise we are complicit in their deaths. This is not a conflict with two equal sides. There are innocent civilians and there are criminals. It is not a complex problem with no obvious solutions. In fact the solutions are written into international law. They won't be easy, nor suit a lot of people with vested interests in the region.

Pro-Palestinian advocates regard PEP as a type of political hypocrisy and an example of anti-Palestinianism, while critics of the phrase regard it as anti-Israel and a smear against the pro-Israel left.",,298,"{'like_count': 291, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 12017}",¡Viva Oxnard!,,2023-10-21 15:49:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/27880515_166485700662696_354826262142779392_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=xBIUg4ap5zQAX8TuJQh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfACxmPjkVdn_YLJNG9MYHOtm2cPWVthHPSHDx9On-lhzQ&oe=655A977E,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyqp4VMxyna/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394665766_891888539150472_4607780330597493619_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NRrg6zun-IgAX9qKWO3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCkWS4ZvOjfZYUXQ5wJ56Fag8qkHGBVTT2KDc1iYx1_1g&oe=65598028

instagram,"London's Metropolitan Police are reporting a significant surge in antisemitic and anti-Islamic hate crimes in the city since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict. ⁠
⁠
In a statement Friday, they said that from October 1 to 18 the department saw 218 antisemitic offenses compared to 15 in the same period last year, while Islamophobic offenses jumped from 42 to 101, representing increases of 1,353 percent and 140 percent respectively. ⁠
⁠
The department said the crimes include abuse directed at individuals or groups in person or online, racially or religiously motivated criminal damage and other offenses. ⁠
⁠
They said the sharp rise has come despite an increased police presence near parochial schools, places of worship and communities where the ""levels of concern"" are known to be the highest. Police said officers have visited 445 schools and 1,930 places of worship, and plan to make more such visits. ⁠
⁠
The department reported 21 arrests for hate crimes during the period and encouraged people to report the offenses to the police. ⁠
⁠
Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner Ade Adelekan discussed the statistics with reporters Friday ahead of a pro-Palestinian march planned for Saturday in London. ⁠

instagram,"Trucks carrying humanitarian aid from Egypt into war-torn and besieged Gaza started passing through the Rafah border crossing Saturday, a security source and an Egyptian Red Crescent official told AFP.

Egyptian state television showed several trucks entering the gate on the 15th day of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Gaza's Health Ministry says Israel's brutal retaliatory air and missile strikes have killed at least 4,137 Palestinians, including hundreds of children, while over a million of the besieged territory's 2.3 million people have been displaced.

Israel, however, kept up heavy bombardment of 'targets' throughout Gaza overnight on Saturday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to ""fight until victory"" following the release of the first two hostages by the enclave's ruling Hamas group.

instagram,"Meta has apologized for adding ""terr*rist"" to the biographies of some Instagram users describing themselves as Palestinian.

Meta said it fixed a problem ""that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations"" in some of its products.

""We sincerely apologise that this happened,"" said Meta.

The platform has also faced accusations of suppressing content voicing support for Palestinians during the Israel-Gaza conflict.

Shocking new figures revealed a surge in hate crimes in the capital following Hamas’ terror attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli military response.

From 1 to 18 October, police recorded 218 antisemitic offences compared to 15 recorded in the same period last year – an increase of 1,353 per cent.

Islamophobic hate crime has also leapt up by 140 per cent, with 101 Islamophobia offences recorded versus 42 in the same period last year.”

instagram,"“You can’t be friends with someone who wants your life.” – @oprah said it best. 👏🏽

when people want someone else’s life, it makes them irrational, strategic, subservient, and sometimes envious. In other words: not a healthy friendship or business collaboration at all. And I know that when friends, family, lovers or colleagues want what you have, you will always deal with conflict and destruction. #findyourtribe 

Collaboration over competition is the best way to achieve, believe in yourself and your goals. 🥊

instagram,"As the Israel Palestine conflict intensifies, UFC have now re-instated their ban on flags & political gestures. 2 weeks ago, UFC dropped the ‘flag ban’ & allowed fighters to wear/bring international/political flags into the octagon. Dana White publicly stated that he felt fighters should be able to bring flags into the octagon, a couple of weeks ago. “Everybody’s too soft, everybody’s too sensitive about everything. When the decision was made to do this, I was just like… Eh, what’s the big deal if they don’t have flags?”

Although, following growing geopolitical tension & the U.S. State Department issuing a “Worldwide Caution” alert for stateside travelers visiting Abu Dhabi or anywhere in the Middle East, this has impacted the WWE & UFC’s company decision-making. Several high-profile fighters/icons such as Khabib Nurmagomedov, Khamzat Chimaev, Belal Muhammad etc have made their feelings vocal recently, regarding the Israel Palestine conflict. Given that Khabib & Khamzat will be present on the fight night itself, there has been a mounting expectation that fighters may wear flags that represent a nation involved in this conflict. Given the tense geopolitical climate, UFC felt that the decision to allow fighters to endorse either side would not be feasible.

What is your opinion on the UFC’s decision to reinstate banning flags, ahead of UFC294? Do you feel this is justified or unjustified, in your view?

And I am centering the most widely held belief amongst Muslims, that of standing with the oppressed and against evil or injustice. As a Hadith from the Prophet Muhammad said ‘Whoever among you sees evil, let him change it with his hand. And if he cannot do so, then let him change it with his tongue.’”

I couldn’t agree more.

Our great city is home to Muslims, Jews, and so many other beautiful communities. My heart is with all of you who are hurting and heartbroken.

Our goal this morning, and every single day, is to make this city as safe and welcoming to all people as we possibly can. To stand up and speak out against hate.

instagram,"Walking around the Florentine district of Tel Aviv on the morning of Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, it would be very easy to forget that the country is at war. The coffee shops are filled with locals reading newspapers and meeting friends, as a steady stream of dog walkers pass by in the morning sunshine. It’s only when you stop to look that you see the posters showing faces of the people believed to currently be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Then, you notice the expressions of quiet sadness, two weeks to the day since the shock attack on Southern Israel. Is the mood due to what has been, or what now seems inevitable? While images of the horrific conditions inside Gaza fill the news feeds, the people of Israel know that any incursion will come at a high human cost for their own country too. With so many having friends and family in active service, the fallout will be personal.

Back at the Gaza border, the low hum of a distant drone circling above is regularly interrupted by the rush of a fighter, circling once, twice, before a plume of smoke appears in the distance. Seconds later, the boom of impact reaches the assembled media overlooking the scene. Time and again, the strikes hit all across the horizon, some falling into the no-man’s land in between our vantage point and the Gaza fence.

An unexpected crack and rush of rocket fire sends everyone to the ground, looking around, trying to work out the confusing order to the sounds they heard. An outgoing Israeli position has fired for the first time from very close nearby, leaving everyone a little more alert.

The sun sets over the horizon and the strikes continue. As the day fades and it becomes harder to focus, it dawns on me that there are no lights coming from Gaza. The skeletal shapes of the ruins which were so sad to see in the day have somehow taken on an even darker form.

Cosgrave drew criticism after a post on social media questioned war crimes committed by Israel, noting that ""War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are,"" the post read.

instagram,"A primary principle on the path of justice is to discern power dynamics.

In nearly every large conflict, there is a side that holds more power—money, allies, weapons, etc.—and another party that has relatively less.

In each instance, the side that holds more of this kind of power must act with discretion and reserve knowing that its power comes with responsibilities.

Those concerned about justice are always concerned about power. Who has it? Who doesn’t have it? Who must be protected and who must be restrained?

instagram,"World leaders gathered in Cairo on Saturday and called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and a massive increase in aid to Gaza.

They also called for a definitive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That echoed a proposal for renewed talks on a two-state solution, put forward by the summit’s host, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

With Israel preparing for a ground invasion, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the summit, “We must act now to end the nightmare.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said humanitarian corridors need to be opened to get aid to Gazans.

More than a dozen countries sent top-level representatives, including Zhai Jun, China’s special envoy for Middle East issues. He went to the region to help ease tensions and promote peace talks. 

Israel did not attend. The United States did not send any senior officials.

instagram,"Hamas terrorists who carried out a surprise attack on October 7 were found to be under the influence of Captagon, a synthetic amphetamine-type stimulant that has been clandestinely produced in southern Europe and trafficked through Turkey to the consumer markets on the Arabian Peninsula, as reported by Nir Dvori of Channel 12.

The pills were recovered from the pockets of many terrorists who lost their lives on Israeli soil.This stimulant drug, also known as the ""cocaine for the poor,"" allowed the terrorists to commit heinous acts with a sense of calmness and indifference. Simultaneously, it kept them highly alert for extended periods and suppressed their appetite.

Captagon: Used by ISIS
Captagon gained notoriety in 2015 when it was discovered to be used by ISIS fighters to suppress fear prior to carrying out terrorist operations. As the influence of terrorist organizations like ISIS diminished, Lebanon and Syria took the reins and began producing and distributing the drug on a large scale.Gaza, in particular, became a popular market for the drug, especially among addicted young individuals.

Captagon belongs to the amphetamine family and was initially developed to address attention disorders, narcolepsy, and depression. Despite its highly addictive nature and potential for inducing psychotic reactions, it continues to enjoy popularity in the Middle East due to its affordability and ease of manufacturing. In poorer countries, the drug can be purchased for a dollar or two, while in wealthier nations, it may cost up to 20 dollars per pill. Its primary effects include arousing feelings of euphoria, reducing the need for sleep, suppressing appetite, and providing sustained energy. 
According to medical professionals in Lebanon and Syria, Captagon is not only prevalent among fighters but is also frequently used by desperate civilians residing in conflict zones.Once a source of revenue for ISIS members through drug smuggling, Captagon has now become a major source of income for Syria and is actively supported by Hezbollah.

Around two years ago, an investigation conducted by The New York Times revealed that individuals associated with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, in",,194,"{'like_count': 189, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 7670}",glbl_jhd_dly_mntr,,2023-10-21 18:24:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/13129393_1007939159293798_949321728_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NYXzYkJMI4YAX9oxTN8&_nc_oc=AQn8i4PaJvQCN0TL8sCI1Y0uUtKcbxdjJ3tLzph32VdqyrdlC3C7kpp12n6Dn2-4afo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB5dZugPZ_ERWZl1dr1NnL59qS0ML_xLs9w00gGrcjEiQ&oe=655B4E29,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyq7mNvP8g3/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393704738_309232985149069_5886522692159847075_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=rMvUxHH-a4sAX_Tp7t3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA-XaYVouDn-1FRAe08_1wSysN2mRAzvGYD5rDddv-N_Q&oe=653D775C

instagram,"Thoughts on this?🏫📚🪧🇵🇸🇮🇱🇨🇦⬇️
-READ BELOW-

York University has issued a warning: if the institution’s student unions do not recant or sufficiently defend their collective statement on the Israel-Palestine conflict, they will risk losing their relationship with the university.

The university’s statement, released to the public on Friday, addressed the “serious and ongoing harms caused by [the groups’] statement,” which declares “solidarity with the Palestinian people” against “the settler-colonial apartheid state of Israel.”

“Since 1948, Palestinian people have been systemically displaced from their land and homes as a result of state-sanctioned violence, siege, and genocide,” reads the student unions’ statement in part. “Our Unions remain unwavering in our support of the Palestinian people's fight for self-determination and liberation.”

In its statement, York University said the unions must retract the statement, issue an apology, acknowledge the impact of the statement on campus, and remove all union executives by 5 p.m. on Oct. 25.

Alternatively, the university said the student unions can challenge the assertion that the statement breached York’s Regulation Regarding Student Organizations by the same deadline.

If it’s determined the statement did break the school’s anti-harassment policy, York said it could impose sanctions, the most severe of which would be cutting ties with the offending union.

“The University is deeply disappointed that this step is now required, but we are compelled to uphold University policies and to act in the best interests of the York community, including those of the student unions and their memberships,” said administrators for York in the statement.

The Jewish Campus Coalition previously condemned the statement from the student unions, calling the remarks “blatantly prejudiced” and demonstrating “an extreme and deliberate disregard for not only Jewish but all students affected by the horrible tragedies that have been and continue to occur.”

Neither the York Federation of Students, York University Graduate Student Association nor Glendon College Student Union have recanted the statement.",,175,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 175, 'num_users': 276665}",Straight Outta The 6ix 🇨🇦,,2023-10-21 19:00:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/89383766_523978791826069_4386749213812195328_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=8Rdu9w9eUTUAX8Pxxm-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBnOSc7TnsskWt2NieNIePFCyHBEgMDMsTedL-rwOyhTQ&oe=655A2500,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyq_xFuJm2e/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394036474_1057027475292788_6402003184025612049_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NIxCSVk6Y8QAX-1JpF5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAmF4GsrBS7CKaoBtdp11r7g5jm2OzApw8zwlwH1zwUIA&oe=653C3599

But fear not, for each of us has a purpose on this world. Don't let their fear infiltrate your soul. Look at the grander scheme of things. Everything unfolds for a reason, even the darkest moments. The universe's essence is change, reshaping societies and our own lives. Change and conflict have their conclusions, and this is how the cosmos teaches right from wrong. Armed with this awareness, we can stand for what's just, mend the world's flaws, and empower the good. Don't let the media or bad news dim your inner light. Guard your energy, and the universe will safeguard and lead you toward the new. No matter the power of those who seek to corrupt, an atomic bomb cannot obliterate our free individual consciousness.

instagram,"Chaos erupted in Berlin, leaving dozens of police officers injured, as pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of the German capital in defiance of the local ban on such demonstrations over concerns of antisemitism.

On Wednesday evening, protests were held throughout Germany following the explosion at a hospital in Gaza, which international media initially blamed on Israel without evidence. In the Berlin borough of Neukölln, hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists gathered despite the city’s ban on anti-Israel protests. The demonstration devolved into violence and rioting, with local police reporting that the demonstrators attacked officers with stones, bottles, and makeshift pyrotechnic missiles.The police also reported that several cars, a truck, and a tree were set on fire during the chaos. The police, in turn, used pepper spray on some of the violent rioters and used water cannons to put out garbage cans and tires that were set on fire in the streets.According to the Berlin Police, 174 people were arrested at the banned protest and 65 police officers were injured during the rioting that lasted until the early hours of Thursday morning. The protest was organised by the “Youth against Racism” activist group, German broadcaster NTV reports.According to the German tabloid newspaper Bild, protesters in Berlin chanted slogans such as “Free Palestine,” “Allahu Akbar,” and “Israel – child murderer”.

Pro-Palestinian protests were also held in other German cities, including in Frankfurt where police deployed water cannons against the banned demonstration, as well as in Hamburg and in Nuremberg.The protests came just hours after a Jewish synagogue was firebombed with Molotov cocktails in the early hours of Wednesday in Berlin.Jewish leaders in Germany have warned their communities to be cautious of potential antisemitic attacks amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas after the terror group launched a series of deadly terror attacks, leaving at least 1,400 Israelis and tourists dead, in addition to approximately 200 people taken hostage by the radical Islamist organisation.In response, Jewish communities in Germany have advised against speaking Hebrew",,165,"{'like_count': 147, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 7670}",glbl_jhd_dly_mntr,,2023-10-21 18:09:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/13129393_1007939159293798_949321728_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NYXzYkJMI4YAX9oxTN8&_nc_oc=AQn8i4PaJvQCN0TL8sCI1Y0uUtKcbxdjJ3tLzph32VdqyrdlC3C7kpp12n6Dn2-4afo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB5dZugPZ_ERWZl1dr1NnL59qS0ML_xLs9w00gGrcjEiQ&oe=655B4E29,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyq54Lav_yS/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394900773_1408216379793469_5860408425428266590_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=2yeCPjhwxhYAX_G3or3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDvroexx0qZYY-d5CePV0YELF3jFhWtLK6QSdlfbATp4A&oe=653D9521
instagram,"As 20 aid trucks arrived at a UN storage facility in central Gaza on Saturday, October 21, uncertainty loomed for the 2.3 million people still blockaded there.

It’s been two weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing close to 1,400 people in coordinated attacks that prompted devastating Israeli retaliation and increased tensions around the world. 

Israel said it would its increase strikes on Gaza, starting Saturday.

Hamas is holding as many as 200 hostages it kidnapped during the attacks, and says 50 more captives are being held by other armed groups inside Gaza.

Hamas previously said 20 hostages were killed by Israeli air strikes, without providing details.

Two American hostages were released by Hamas Friday and handed over to Israeli authorities after Qatar helped mediate their release. 

In addition to Israeli hostages, Hamas is also holding citizens of Thailand, Argentina, Britain, Germany, France and Portugal.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed ‘mighty vengeance’ for the Oct. 7 massacre. 

A ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces could come at any time.  More than 4300 Palestinian people, including women and children, have been killed in the retaliatory attacks.

Demonstrations around the world show deep divisions in communities supporting Palestinian and Israeli civilians.

The U.S. has affirmed support for Israel’s right to defend itself, but officials have expressed doubt that Israel has crafted an endgame to the conflict that threatens to draw in other countries and divide the world.

Arab leaders at a Cairo summit on Saturday condemned the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. With Israel and the U.S. absent from the summit, no agreement was made toward how to contain the violence.

Gulf Cooperation Council and ASEAN countries called for a durable ceasefire, the immediate release of civilian hostages and detainees, and a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

China’s special envoy on Middle East affairs has also called for efforts to implement a two-state solution and promote an early, comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question.",,164,"{'like_count': 153, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 306643}",CGTN America News,,2023-10-21 21:12:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/31203730_2064475097157556_1782867652151083008_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=_-udnCSRWUcAX-H093l&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfABQV1Y4uyyjMKzXmIO57mjM7wVUwTxsvoqsjlR6Ut7Hw&oe=655AFBD1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyrO665Mgcn/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/394508334_715506673941250_2415827360253177578_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=uMSG1Uf3u-AAX9RrTWV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAhRGb0-JaS8FLKY3GlrkKvxfMDkvBh8tFauB1Ntjhg6Q&oe=653EB5F3

社运人士吴家和（Gilbert Goh）10月19日在Instagram上传一张他在芳林公园演说角落外展示标语牌的照片，上面写着：“要和平不要战争。以色列停止在加沙杀戮！哈马斯释放所有人质！”

新加坡警察部队10月21日说，警方注意到在一则社交媒体贴文中，一名男子在演说角落外手持与以哈冲突有关的标语，警方正对这起事件进行调查。警方提醒公众，新加坡的公共集会须遵守公共秩序法令。在新加坡，公众在没有获得警方批准下，擅自组织或参与集会都是违法的。

警方和国家公园局10月18日已发出联合文告说，新加坡的种族与宗教和谐不是理所当然的，因此不能让外部事件影响到国内局势。“鉴于这个课题的敏感性，以及海外局势变幻不定，这类事件有可能扰乱本地公共秩序，因此相关活动的申请将被拒绝。”　📸: 联合早报

instagram,"Over 200 people rallied on the University of Utah campus Friday evening in support of Palestine in the latest war between Israel and Hamas, an armed Palestinian militant group.

“What has happened has been a result of 75 years of imprisonment, physical and emotional torture, humiliation, displacement, ethnic cleansing and genocide,” said Yafi, a U graduate student. “This was not unprovoked.” 

Hamas’ recent attack on Israel and Israel’s offensive in Gaza in response is an escalation in a long conflict that has already left thousands dead on both sides.

Some students who attended the rally have personal connections to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Jack Bellows, a U student who’s the chair of the Democratic Socialists of America, has a grandfather who was born in the Palestinian city Ramallah, and his neighborhood was bombed in 1948. This was part of what Palestinians refer to as the “Nakba,” Arabic for “catastrophe” – when militia attacks that preceded the Arab-Israeli war led to the killing of approximately 15,000 Palestinians. 

In a press conference on Thursday, Gov. Spencer Cox said his heart was broken for Palestinians as well, but that he had zero empathy for Hamas. 

He added that any efforts to harm or threaten Jewish citizens or Israelis in Utah would be met with, “swift justice to the fullest extent of the law.” 

“I would say the exact same thing towards our Palestinians,” he said. “Our Palestinians, they are our neighbors. They are Utahns and we love them and we’re grateful they’re here. And we extend those same protections to you as well.”

instagram,"One of the impacts of trauma is a feeling of self sabotage and not being able to move forward in life - feeling stuck, things grinding to a halt, constantly coming up against brick walls.
It’s incredibly frustrating. 😫

For all our best intentions, we simply can’t move past the blocks, can’t seem to achieve our goals.
Shame can arise as we compare our progress to others.
We can feel inadequate and really disappointed in ourselves.

We experience this inner conflict and turmoil. One part of us wants to achieve a goal which is polarised with another part of us who won’t allow this happen.

WHY?!! WHY wouldn’t we want to progress with our goals?

It’s a trauma response.
We identify this part of us who is causing the bottleneck. The first step is to know it’s there. We can assume this part is in a lot of FEAR.

All parts have positive intent for the system.

There’s usually a fear of losing something, or something bad happening.
For example, if we achieve our goal, perhaps people will be jealous and try to harm us. It can be traced back to childhood. When good things happened to us, there were negative consequences and severe punishment.

Perhaps as the scapegoat child it wasn’t safe to outshine the golden child. We learnt it was safer to squash our intelligence and not bring attention to ourselves. We HAD to take on this strategy to get our basic needs met as a minor.

Acknowledge the fears and let this part of you know - things are different now. We can handle jealousy, we can handle people not liking us, we can handle other people’s discomfort at us achieving our goals. We have WAY more resources, information and knowledge than we did all those years ago.

instagram,"How did you learn to lace your shoes? 

In Subotica, our team covers several informal accommodations in order to provide people with basic necessities, such as food, water, and showers. In spending time with people during distributions, we get the chance to witness the living realities of people on the move: we share stories, we play games and we have different conversations.

During one of our distributions in a squat hosting around 200 people, we met A. A is a 12 years old boy from Syria who is currently on his way to Holland to meet with his uncle. Soon after we arrived at the squat, A. caught our attention. He was walking around with only one shoe and he had scratches all over his face and hands. He had just arrived in Serbia from Bulgaria with three other people- two of them also minors. The scratches, they explain, were caused by the bushes in which they were hiding in order not to be seen by the police and cross the border.

We accompanied him to the car where we gave him a pair of shoes. If in his behavior A. was acting as an adult, when we gave him the shoes, we realised he could not lace them. No one knew where his parents were and no one was there to take care of him or teach him how to tie a pair of shoes. 

As an accompanied minor, the story of A. holds many questions that we will not be able to answer. According to UNICEF, children represent one quarter of all refugees and migrants who came to Europe. There is a tendency in migration studies to rank migrants as victims of socio-political strucutres that force them to move. According to the stories we hear as NNK, the reasons why children migrate are complex and diverse. Like their adult counterparts, also minors should be considered as active agents of their lives. In war countries, families can seek the possibility to send their children abroad to give them a better future. They may flee due to war, conflict or other situations involving serious human rights violations. Compared to other groups, however, unaccompanied minors face higher risks of violence, exploitation, and abuse, including gender-based violence.

instagram,"ما يحصل في غزة ليس نزاعاً، ليس صراعاً، ليس أزمة. علينا استخدام المصطلحات الصحيحة. 
ما يحصل هو #انتزاع_الأراضي، وهو الاستيلاء على الأراضي على نطاق واسع من خلال شراء مساحات كبيرة أو استئجارها من قبل الشركات المحلية وعبر الوطنية والحكومات والأفراد النافذين. تشمل الطرق الأخرى للاستيلاء على الأراضي الاستعمار والاحتلال والإلحاق والحرب، وكل منها يعتمد على ترتيبات مختلفة ولكنها متكاملة، حيث يمكن لأحدها أن يضع الأساس ويخلق الظروف لتطبيق الآخر.

What is happening in Gaza is neither a conflict, nor a clash, nor a crisis. We should use the right terminology. 
What is happening #LandGrabbing, which is a large-scale acquisition of land through the purchase or lease of significant tracts by domestic and transnational companies, governments, and powerful individuals. Other methods of appropriating someone else’s space and territory include colonization, occupation, annexation, and war, each based on distinct yet complementary arrangements, where one can lay the groundwork and create conditions for the application of another.

⁠
𝙃𝙞𝙩𝙡𝙚𝙧, 𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙣, 𝙑𝙖𝙙𝙚𝙧 𝙚𝙣 𝙢𝙤𝙚𝙙𝙚𝙧 van Daniel Finkelstein: In 𝙃𝙞𝙩𝙡𝙚𝙧, 𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙣, 𝙑𝙖𝙙𝙚𝙧 𝙚𝙣 𝙢𝙤𝙚𝙙𝙚𝙧 vertelt Finkelstein het ontroerende en soms huiveringwekkende verhaal van zijn ouders. Het is een verhaal over vervolging en overleven en over de bijna onvoorstelbare moed van twee gewone families.⁠
⁠
𝘿𝙚 𝘽𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙜𝙤𝙣𝙙𝙞ë𝙧𝙨 van Bart van Loo: Meesterverteller Bart van Loo neemt de lezer op sleeptouw langs duizend jaar Europese geschiedenis. Zijn zoektocht voert hem naar het ontstaan van de Nederlanden in de vijftiende eeuw. En wat blijkt? De Lage Landen zijn een Bourgondische uitvinding.⁠
⁠
𝘿𝙚 𝙝𝙤𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙧𝙙𝙟𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙜𝙚 𝙤𝙤𝙧𝙡𝙤𝙜 𝙩𝙚𝙜𝙚𝙣 𝙋𝙖𝙡𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙖 van Rashid Khalidi is geen verhaal van slachtofferschap, noch probeert het de fouten van Palestijnse leiders of de opkomst van nationalistische bewegingen aan beide kanten te ontkennen. Maar door de geschiedenis op een heldere manier in kaart te brengen vanuit Palestijns perspectief, geeft dit boek een nieuwe kijk op een conflict dat tot op heden voortduurt.⁠
⁠
𝙉𝙖 𝙙𝙚 𝙗𝙚𝙫𝙧𝙞𝙟𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜 van Barbara Skarga is een urgent boek, nu een beter begrip van de complexe realiteit en verhouding van Rusland met zijn buurlanden meer dan ooit noodzakelijk is.⁠
⁠
𝙂𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙞𝙟𝙙 𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙯𝙚𝙣 van Jolande Withuis: In 𝙂𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙞𝙟𝙙 𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙯𝙚𝙣 schetst Withuis met een schat aan materiaal het leven, de liefdes (m/v), de vriendschappen en de lange, veelzijdige loopbaan van een van Nederlands meest gerenommeerde beeldend kunstenaressen. Het resultaat is een springlevend en aangrijpend portret van een begaafde, fascinerende en moedige vrouw.⁠

instagram,"What’s happening in the Middle East, the Israel-Hamas War, weighs heavy in the hearts of many. It is a vulnerable and tumultuous time. We want to acknowledge the tremendous suffering and introspection of our student body and the world. 

On Oct. 7, Hamas, a militant group governing Gaza, shockingly attacked southern Israel. BBC News reported more than 1,400 people were killed and upwards of 200 hostages were taken. In retaliation, close to 2,700 people in Gaza have died from Israeli air strikes. 

Conflict and cynicism continue to escalate both overseas and domestically, as a humanitarian crisis unfolds internationally and hate crimes become a looming threat at home.

As I did my rounds on two levels, it suddenly hit me why I recognized him. He was MARTIN  FLETCHER, the longtime NBC Middle East correspondent, who retired  just last year.

instagram,"But (maybe) it ain’t that easy for your average OG.
The (in)famous original ""American gangster”, Ellsworth Raymond “Bumpy” Johnson, who, according to his widow ""had a hand in almost every illegal enterprise operating in Harlem"" including the drug game which ravaged Harlem in the days before Hip Hop, was quoted in a 1967 interview as saying ""what I really am, when the chips are down, is a Black nationalist"". In between his notorious underworld dealings he is known to have offered ""protection"" to the legendary actor Paul Robeson who was then under siege from the ant-communist white forces of amerika. Johnson also offered protection to a New York Chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) when they were threatened by ""local gangsters of the Mafia"" while CORE was protesting brutality against blacks in front of a police station. Bumpy sent a message to the Mafia stating ""If any of those CORE kids are harmed, I will not guarantee the safety of any Mafia member in Harlem."" And in 1964, Johnson is also known to have offered to ""take care of"" Malcolm Xs ""problems"" after he came into conflict with the Nation of Islam (NOI). Malcolm X, who reportedly knew Johnson from back in the 1940s when X was a small time Harlem street hustler known as ""Detroit Red"" was quoted as saying to one of his trusted aids after walking away from Bumpy 
I don't want Black folks killing Black people
Even still, after Malcolm X was assassinated, it was Bumpy who, according to Karen E. Miller, the author of Harlem Godfather, 
Went around to all the businesses in Harlem and said 'open up your cash registers 'cause you have to make a donation,' and he took a little bit of something from everybody in order to pay for the funeral of Malcolm X

The Black Nationalist poet Amiri Baraka is quoted as saying that “Bumpy johnson was one of the first to insist that Black dudes run their own rackets and stop paying off the white boys,” but in 1968, Bumpy is quoted as having said to then Student Non-Violence Coordinating Committee (SNCC) leader H. Rap Brown after Brown gave a fiery speech in Harlem I agree with a lot of what you said.",,119,"{'like_count': 117, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 115244}",Jermaine,,2023-10-21 12:59:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/398670429_996671714742300_8602586841025134453_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=W6FPFU_F3kMAX_GjquY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDvdUd_gjEjQMAsTwqiwItl-t2OyIUk9sIyA-IJmcvygw&oe=655B9333,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyqWaOsrQnZ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393668566_711089630878050_5723626090026312977_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=K6rAiaEHPMEAX_4g6VE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBltH8nRCdob4FmDmHXFmma0ZB3n7wQrDxou7VfCiIuGQ&oe=65500B07

The videos, however, generated mixed reactions among residents of the state, who called on the governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, to caution his appointees.
However, in his reaction, following the public outcry, the accused, Mr Onuko, said the situation was misinterpreted.
He stated this in a statement made available to journalists on Saturday, in which he said he was surprised with the rate at which the story was misinterpreted and fed half-baked to the public by the social media users who did not care to get his side.
Explaining what transpired, he said, “I have been inundated with calls and messages from well-meaning friends, colleagues and Ndi Anambra over a video clip that has gone viral on social media regarding an altercation between a GUO driver and myself, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Awka Capital Territory Development Authority.

⁠
In this column, he describes the importance of carrying bear spray, understanding bear behavior, and taking any measure possible to avoid shooting a bear. The fall hunting season coincides with hyperphagia—a period when bears eat as many calories as possible to fatten up for winter hibernation—and human-bear conflict is more likely. ⁠
⁠
Many of these conflicts will not end well for the bear, according to the current issue of “Dispatches from the Wild.” But knowledge and awareness can help improve those outcomes. ⁠

The US has warned Israel to be cautious in its military responses to the Hezbollah fire, stating that an IDF mistake in Lebanon could spark a much larger war.

According to officials close to Biden, if Hezbollah launches a war against Israel, the US military will join the IDF in fighting the terror organization.

instagram,"“If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” ― Malcolm X

Malcolm X's famous quote highlights the profound influence and potential bias of media outlets on public perception. It cautions that, without discernment, one can be subtly manipulated by skewed narratives or selective information. Essentially, instead of empowering the marginalized, the media might inadvertently paint them as adversaries, while portraying the oppressors in a sympathetic or favorable light.

Can you relate it to the Western media's bias regarding the recent Palestine-Israel conflict?

It's a call to be vigilant, question, and seek out diverse sources of information to gain a comprehensive understanding of issues. 📰 📺 🇵🇸

Imagine being unable to protect your child and if you try, you are reprimanded and punished. Imagine being labeled as “high conflict” when you are simply desperate to protect your child. 
Imagine the system that you thought would protect you, failing you.
 
Imagine getting messages like this every day, the attacks are pervasive and unrelenting, affecting every part of your life: your job, your mental health, your cognitive functioning, your emotional state, and your ability to parent.
 
We don’t have to imagine; this is our life.

instagram,"A bit of controversy but a whole lot of flavor with this Natural Processed Ethiopia grown by Ageze Balcha Begna. He has been growing coffee for 42 years and you can taste that experience in the cup ☕️ 🧠 

This coffee was handpicked for Cup Of Excellence (COE) and dried on the raised beds in the Yirgacheffe region of Ethiopia. Known to produce explosive flavored natural coffees, it’s a bummer that internal conflict in Ethiopia this year didn’t allow this coffee to get its official recognition as the best in the world 🌎 🏅 🇪🇹 

This coffee is a flavor explosion of red and purple fruits with a wine like body that makes you savor every sip 🍇 🍓 

Our Recommended Brewing method: Pourover

1. Ratio 1:17
2. Water between 200°-205°C
3. Grind a little finer than medium coarse to really extract all flavors 
4. Also very delicious as a flash brew or immersion method on aeropress! 

There aren’t many coffees like this — we’re lucky to be carrying it ♥️

instagram,"Album of the Day: Muslimgauze - Islamic Songs (Staalplaat)

LISTEN: https://muslimgauze.bandcamp.com/album/islamic-songs

Long before the rise of social media, British producer Bryn Jones dedicated his entire work as Muslimgauze to conflicts and history in the Muslim world, often with an emphasis on the Israeli–Palestinian case. Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon inspired Jones to research the conflict's origins; his research further grew to encompass other conflict-ridden, predominantly Muslim countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Chechnya, Iran and Iraq. 

He concluded that Western interests for natural resources and strategic-political gain were root causes for many of these conflicts and should Western meddling halt, said regions would stabilise.

Jones frequently netted criticism for never having visited the Middle East. He said in a 1994 interview, ""I don't think you can visit an occupied land. It's the principle. Not until it's free again.”

""We see patients arriving in worse and worse conditions,"" says Gina, Medical Coordinator in Khartoum. Due to the conflict, travel is difficult and dangerous, and people postpone moving until the last minute to avoid the roads. 

Even at the Salam Centre for Cardiac Surgery, patients are arriving in fatal conditions: among them, a little girl from Geneina, on the border with Chad.

""She survived only a few hours after her arrival because when she got here, her condition was already too compromised…Sometimes it’s really frustrating.”

instagram,"I don’t know why my “dream man” doesn’t show up in my life… 😢

That’s something a friend of mine recently mentioned during one of our catch-ups. Super interesting… I was very curious into which direction her stories and way of perceiving the world would go. It went down a totally different path than expected, which then made me assume this topic isn’t a priority at the moment.

Two hours later, after having an incredible breakfast and philosophizing about authenticity and the best way to explore when traveling across Asia, we ended up at the topic of freedom, and what it means. And then she casually dropped the sentence “yeah, I love my current freedom and flexibility SO much. I don’t want anybody to limit it. I’m not sure if I’m ready for somebody by my side.”

There it was! I asked my friend if I’m allowed to reflect something back that I saw, and she agreed. So, I asked her: 

“Do I understand correctly: you think that being in a relationship would limit your freedom? While at the same time a part of you wants your dream man to show up in your life?”

“Ha!” she answered & started thinking…. and we went into a deeper conversation about this topic. To cut a long story short: 

We realized one of her worries was that with a man by her side, she wouldn’t be able to act as spontaneously and be as adventurous as she is right now.

I asked her if that assumption was really true, in the sense of an ultimate truth. Nope, it was a fear. My friend then allowed me to offer a more empowering perspective:

 “What if the king by your side wants to explore life WITH YOU? And in cases he doesn’t want to, he is more than happy for you to explore on your own, or with other friends? OR: Maybe he has adventure plans in mind you cannot even imagine in your wildest dreams… How does that sound to you?”

The smile on my friend’s face was priceless. She smiled like a five year old on the birthday party, who was just gifted with a strawberry cake and was told that her party would end with a “kids disco”.

Over to you: Is a subconscious conflict in your life keeping you away from experiencing abundance?

instagram,"Laila, a teacher by profession, pushing for peace in Mali – read and get inspired 👇🏿 
Laila is President of the Women's Leaders Association of Macina and her commitment to speaking up for women in her community started with the marginalisation of little girls from their right to education. Laila and her colleagues work in partnership with the municipality and the administrative authorities to organise community dialogues for the peaceful settlement of disputes. 
In this work, women are the key to peace: 
“In any case, I think that women have a major role to play in peacebuilding. Because peace begins in the family, then in the village and then in the whole community. Women remain the pillars of our families (…) I think every woman should be aware of the role she can play in strengthening social cohesion and peaceful coexistence in our country.” 
 Residing in Mali, a country badly affected by conflict for years, the dream is peace: “Yes, I dream of lasting peace for my country. I dream of seeing a frank dialogue for peace in our commune and further between the sons and daughters lost to armed groups and decision-makers at all levels in Mali. 
I dream of seeing an in-depth analysis of the conflicts for a lasting resolution of the grievances that pit us against each other. I dream that our country, Mali, will once again become a haven of peace and peaceful coexistence.” 
 For the annual UN Security Council Open Debate on Women, Peace and Security, together with many other organisations, Oxfam is calling for the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation and leadership of women in all crises and conflicts and urge the Security Council, the UN, and Member States to uphold them.

instagram,"Apologizing is no easy task and I absolutely love how THE TIME MACHINE skillfully follows one girl’s journey to courageously take responsibility for her mistake and set things right with her friend.
 
After offending her best friend Nia, Bailey wants to apologize, but finds it difficult to express her remorse. She sets upon building a time machine to go back and undo her mistake. When she struggles to finish the project, Nia unexpectantly aids in the completion of the time machine.  Together, they both venture into the contraption, enabling Bailey to deliver a heartfelt apology. This pivotal moment allows the two friends to mend their relationship and move forward.
 
I especially appreciate the “Apologizing Do’s and Don’ts” included in the back to help guide readers when making their own amends.

instagram,"Peace begins within. 

We are so quick to look outside of ourselves, our own thoughts, feelings, actions and inherited beliefs. 

We are so quick to look for solutions, for “what to do and say” — this is a distraction from the real, hard work of addressing the war, violence, hatred and rage that live within our minds and bodies. 

Start with yourself. If the goal is peace — how can you make peace with yourself, first? How can you make peace with your friends, loved ones and community? 

Peace is a verb. 

Are you engaging in conflict in the name of peace? This in itself is a contradiction — this is the problem’s very root. 

Until we can embody what we wish to see in the world, we will not be able to actualize it.

Healing begins within. Dismantling begins within. 

Ask Yourself:
• What messages of hate have I inherited? 
• What wars have I inherited? 
• What rage lives within me? 
• Towards who? 
• How am I violent in my own life and who am I violent towards in words, thoughts or deeds? 
• Do I wish death on anyone?
• Where does that feeling come from?
• What would need to happen for me to make peace with all my relations and community?

The person whose advice I will follow is someone in true integrity - who can own and identify the roots of their own violence, who do not bypass themselves, and instead, integrate this awareness into an active practice of becoming love. 

Can you love your enemy?

It begins with loving the rejected parts of yourself. 

Once you recognize that all judgment is self-judgement, you can see where your work begins.

This is the hardest thing to do because we want to be “right” and we want to fight a perceived enemy —  these are the human qualities preyed on most by those invested in separation, war and division as a tool for making profit. 

Resistance — true resistance — begins within. It begins with knowing your own mind and your own values, first. 

Resist the urge to allow hate into your heart. Resist the violent thoughts about others — your siblings in one global family. Resist becoming what you criticize. Free yourself, and you will see — love is the most effective solution. 

PS. I love you.

When examining the conflict in a text with students, I go beyond just identifying the type of conflict and describing the forces opposing each other to push students to see the impact of the conflict on all of the other events.

In this blog post, find ideas and resources for teaching conflict, including:
💡 reinforcing conflict types with movie trailers
💡 making it visual with color coding
💡 analyzing with graphic organizers
💡 making self to text connections
💡 emphasizing the central conflict

instagram,"In an interview with the Kaimin, University of Montana President Seth Bodnar said his goal for UM is for it to serve as “an engine for social mobility” and to create an “educated citizenry.” But if the University hopes to encourage civic engagement, it needs to fight against the Legislature’s hostility towards student voting rights, not submit to its whims in the name of avoiding conflict.

This year, the University decided not to even forward the renewal of MontPIRG’s optional fee to the Board of Regents, the governing body for the Montana University System, because the administration thought it wouldn’t get approved and would take attention away from UM’s other funding needs, according to Kaimin reporting. Students approved of the effort to renew the fee with 82% ‘yes’ votes in last semester’s student government election. 

The University’s decision betrayed the student body’s wishes and undermined MontPIRG’s get-out-the-vote and ballot-collection efforts on campus that have proven to be effective in getting more students involved in elections.

At the beginning of the semester, the Kaimin called on Bodnar and the University administration to back up its encouragement of civil discourse at UM with action. Yet UM robbed the student advocates at MontPIRG’s opportunity to lobby for the group’s fee and deprived the group of funding for promoting one of the main ways students participate: voting
The Kaimin asks that you remember all the laws the Legislature has moved forward from the past three years when election season comes around. Do your research to find out who made it harder for you to participate in the political process with their bills and votes. Stay up to date with when and how you can register to vote, because as we saw in 2022, the rules can change just weeks before election day.

Advocate for your own vote, students, since the University has shown it won’t stick up for you.

instagram,"Climate change has become a threat multiplier for millions of people around the world, destroying crops and livelihoods and increasing hunger, conflict and displacement—impacting those who have contributed the least to climate change. 

The issue of climate change can often feel far and distant when we talk about how it affects communities experiencing poverty around the world. You may ask, “What can I do sitting here in the U.S.?,” “Does this affect me?” 

Here are 10 things in your home that have a climate change connection—they cause climate change or are impacted by it—and ways you can make a difference.

instagram,"As a person of Indigenous North American and African descent born and residing in the u.s., with ancestral ties to this land AND ancestors who were stolen from our Indigenous land and brought here to be enslaved, I feel in my place to speak to this. 

I've been seeing this argument elevated by ""wellness"" influencers to confuse and disarm ⚪ u.s.ians as being too ignorant to ""take a side"" in this historical moment. This argument is being piled onto claims of antis3mitism for speaking against genocide against Pal3stinians, who are themselves Semitic people.

Be clear that this is a bad faith argument designed to obscure the truth,  evoke historical shame and leverage that to promote ambivalence towards colonialism, all while erasing Indigenous Americans. 

Indigenous people still live in and throughout our occupied territories here in the u.s.

Solidarity in the u.s. is not driven by ⚪ liberals (who tend to be the more ambivalent folks generally)  but actually by the Indigenous,  Black,  oppressed, Anti- z1on1st Jews, and Pal3stinian Diaspora communities here. 

AND be clear that as an  wh1te supremac1st state funded by u.s dollars and supported by global imperialists, Indigenous people recognize that fighting colonialism in Pal3stine absolutely resists it here. This is the actual meaning of solidarity- understanding our collective struggle that we only win together. 

This is what divide and conquer looks like in real time. 

Stay steady in your support of Pal3stinian freedom, and that of oppressed people everywhere. 

Whenever you get confused,  look for the traces of power.  Why would it be a bad thing for ⚪ liberals to oppose the occupation?? Because it's their tax dollars. WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THIS. 

There's no conflict, and no ambivalence when one side has the worlds strongest militaries behind it and one side has no food, water or shelter. 

That's it, and that's all. Simple, not complex.

STOP THE GENOCIDE. 
END THE OCCUPATION.",,77,"{'like_count': 77, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 2422}",Candice Rose Valenzuela,,2023-10-21 19:59:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/398820750_1139678640248823_81420420837937211_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=h_H4OygL75wAX-HvyEs&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBu6RT9hbhHUr_I4JGP9Raom80Jj4v_Oba-yLoNdhFzdA&oe=655A050B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyrGjE5OXNA/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394039217_667465445366303_7353106411870709711_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=aULEQYVYK4EAX8-AQhq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDTkpYVGnlMbgwji1rNq5ibG7eA51MzupJkR0NhK8Wmmg&oe=654B4C45

instagram,"Grateful to @lavc.rainbowpride Center & student health at Los Angeles Valley College for their investment in student safety. 

It’s Domestic Violence Awareness Month and students had an honest, difficult, and brave conversation about the relationship conflict cycle that is present in many DV patterns. 

Healthy relationships have conflict. But they don’t tend to cycle over and over again through explosive bad behaviors that lead to the need for dramatic apologies. In the “calm” moments of DV relationships, more bonding is taking place, so that the next time tension starts to build we are even less likely to leave. 

It’s complicated, it’s personal, and, it’s predictable and widespread. All at the same time. Anyone can find themself in a relationship with an emotionally controlling person, anyone can get caught up. At the same time, some people are more at risk than others. 

It’s one of the most important conversations we can have in our communities. I remember what it took to set new standards for my own life—a LOT of support. We have to take care of each other. This is not separate from anything else happening today—DV numbers go up in conflict zones and when communities are under stress. 

Do you see this cycle in relationships around you? It’s not always clear that there’s one abusive partner and one victim, but the effects of unhealthy patterns are hard to hide. Please don’t ignore them if you see them.",,61,"{'like_count': 55, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 4320}","Vanessa Carlisle PhD, MFA",,2023-10-21 00:30:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/391130227_343042258302449_4768533781182236936_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=f3aJmUhZB_AAX-I3s7Q&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbUEtIFLwZ8kGf8kveFyhojNQOruUQ3xWyG6M4O1FbQA&oe=655AB111,https://www.instagram.com/p/CypAuHJpz38/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393571289_1006878783753896_7735211228022882038_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NC07c_zunFUAX-VRAOJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCo3fpTp8sB62YUMRdSh26Xl8eLlUVcsDMsyMHjv8ZACQ&oe=655137D0

Once they're all back home, we should also find those cruel beings who harmed them and go full mid-evil on them . This way, we'll instill fear in the hearts of our enemies.

Contribution to Peace
 
* I contribute to Peace when I strive to express the best of myself in my contacts with others. 
* I contribute to Peace when I use my intelligence and my abilities to serve the Good. 
* I contribute to Peace when I feel compassion toward all those who suffer. 
* I contribute to Peace when I look upon all men and women as my brothers and sisters, regardless of race, culture, or religion. 
* I contribute to Peace when I rejoice over the happiness of others and pray for their well-being. 
* I contribute to Peace when I listen with tolerance to opinions that differ from mine or even oppose them. 
* I contribute to Peace when I resort to dialogue rather than to force to settle any conflict. 
* I contribute to Peace when I respect Nature and preserve it for generations to come. 
* I contribute to Peace when I do not seek to impose my conception of God upon others. 
* I contribute to Peace when I make Peace the foundation of my ideals and philosophy.

instagram,"Apeirogon: A Novel
By Colum McCann

Based on the real-life experiences of Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian, and Rami Elhanan, an Israeli, two men bound by the violent deaths of their daughters, the novel is unlike anything the Irish-born writer has ever attempted.

From the National Book Award–winning and bestselling author of Let the Great World Spin comes an epic novel rooted in the unlikely real-life friendship between two fathers.
 
Bassam Aramin is Palestinian. Rami Elhanan is Israeli. They inhabit a world of conflict that colors every aspect of their lives, from the roads they are allowed to drive on to the schools their children attend to the checkpoints, both physical and emotional, they must negotiate.
 
But their lives, however circumscribed, are upended one after the other: first, Rami’s thirteen-year-old daughter, Smadar, becomes the victim of suicide bombers; a decade later, Bassam’s ten-year-old daughter, Abir, is killed by a rubber bullet. Rami and Bassam had been raised to hate one another. And yet, when they learn of each other’s stories, they recognize the loss that connects them. Together they attempt to use their grief as a weapon for peace—and with their one small act, start to permeate what has for generations seemed an impermeable conflict.
 
This extraordinary novel is the fruit of a seed planted when the novelist Colum McCann met the real Bassam and Rami on a trip with the non-profit organization Narrative 4. McCann was moved by their willingness to share their stories with the world, by their hope that if they could see themselves in one another, perhaps others could too.
 
With their blessing, and unprecedented access to their families, lives, and personal recollections, McCann began to craft Apeirogon, which uses their real-life stories to begin another—one that crosses centuries and continents, stitching together time, art, history, nature, and politics in a tale both heartbreaking and hopeful. The result is an ambitious novel, crafted out of a universe of fictional and nonfictional material, with these fathers’ moving story at its heart.

Our digital cover star, Karishma Tanna Bangera (@karishmaktanna) tied the knot with Mumbai-based businessman, Varun Bangera on February 5, 2022. But marriage is a lot more than having a magnificent wedding. It requires love, understanding, wisdom, and a lot more.

In conversation with Brides Today, Tanna talks about her love language, her conflict style, and the journey she embarked on to find her dream lehenga.

Read excerpts from the cover interview:

“My definition of love has evolved over the years. Earlier, it used to be about passion and excitement. Now, it’s more about understanding, support, and a deep emotional connection,” she adds, “I do believe in soulmates, but I’m not sure about love at first sight. I think it’s possible to have a strong connection with someone right away, but true love often develops and deepens over time.”

instagram,"In a tragic incident, an Israeli air attack targeted a church compound in Gaza, resulting in numerous casualties. The strike damaged the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church, which had provided refuge for people of various faiths during the ongoing conflict. Regrettably, at least 16 Christian Palestinians lost their lives in the attack. The Israeli military stated that their objective was to hit a command and control center responsible for launching rockets towards Israel. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem strongly condemned this act, asserting that targeting churches and shelters for innocent civilians is a war crime. The conflict in Gaza has caused a significant loss of life, with most of the casualties being civilians, intensifying the urgency for Palestinian solidarity and the right to exist.

instagram,"Writer: Sam Leslie @samleslie_2024 Media: Sofia Gevorgian @sofia_gevorgian In 1688, the French challenged Dutch dominance at Little Komenda by constructing a trading post. The Eguafo Kingdom gladly received French interest as it capitalized off of competing trade partners. In pursuit of complete dominance, the Dutch malevolently turned their hostilities against the Eguafo Kingdom. The Dutch partnered with the neighboring African Adom state to attack the Eguafo; however, in early 1688, the Eguafo used French gold to bribe the Adom towards a neutral position. This tactic displayed the power of mutually beneficial international exchanges, the power of cooperation. Still, the Dutch refused to accept the plausibility of international communion; they allied instead with the Twifos, powerful local traders who were being “hindered to trade.” The ingrained power of the Dutch and Twifo usurped Eguafo control, and this led to Dutch victory and a beheaded king. Thereafter, the Dutch and the Twifo held influence over Little Komenda while French and English companies abandoned their factories. Clearly, there was a conflict between which pathways should pave the future of international relations: a pathway of exploitation or one of cooperation. In this battle the Dutch’s decision to choose exploitation over cooperation set a grim precedent.

The event drew the participation of leaders from various Arab nations and other countries, along with their governmental representatives, and the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres.

His Highness' participation in the summit aligns with the UAE’s continued efforts to collaborate with international partners in supporting all diplomatic endeavours and initiatives aimed at establishing a just, comprehensive, secure, and sustainable peace that ends violence in the region and enhances regional security and stability.

The summit, convened at the invitation of the Egyptian President, seeks to address de-escalation in the Gaza Strip and the Palestinian territories, emphasising the utmost priority of an immediate ceasefire and ending hostilities to prevent further expansion of the conflict and the exacerbation of humanitarian crises in the Middle East. Additionally, the summit will discuss developments related to the Palestinian cause, its future, and work towards defining a clear horizon to achieve a just, comprehensive, secure, and sustainable peace in the region.

MOSUL, NINEVEH, IRAQ - 2023/10/20: A protester holds a placard during a protest. Hundreds of supporters of the Iraqi Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Forces gathered to protest against the United States for its support of Israel and to express solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The conflict started on October 7 when the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack in Israel, prompting Israeli retaliation. This conflict has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives in both Gaza and Israel. (Photo by Ismael Adnan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

 Biden's recent venture to Israel, marked by a blend of strong alliance affirmation and humanitarian gestures, amidst a turbulent Israel-Hamas conflict, reveals a diplomatically awkward dance that, despite intentions, might have aggravated the precarious Middle East dynamics, showcasing a delicate, perhaps misstepped, balance between allegiance, humanitarian concerns, and regional peace pursuits. #Israel

instagram,"But the billionaire seems to have a grand plan for X, which involves taking the free out of free speech. It couldn't have come at a more difficult moment.

This week, Musk's social-media company started to test a new $1 annual subscription feature called Not A Bot for new users creating an account in New Zealand and the Philippines. It's part of an effort to reduce spam and manipulation, the company said.

This week also happens to have been one of the worst for X's reputation since Musk's takeover of the company formerly known as Twitter, as the raging Israel-Gaza conflict has triggered the spread of alarming amounts of disinformation, lies, and inaccuracies.

Musk has flirted with the idea of putting the entirety of X behind a paywall for some time. His rationale for doing so has typically revolved around the idea that a paywall could go a long way towards removing the spam bots that clog up the platform with falsehoods.

There may be some merit to that. A paywall, for instance, may have stopped a fake account posing as an Al Jazeera journalist from cropping up and spreading unfounded claims about the Israel-Gaza conflict.

But by starting to charge users for access to X, Musk enters dangerous territory: a platform vital for documenting and sharing current affairs through free speech in real-time risks turning into a pay-to-play game.

If it isn't clear why that's bad, take a moment to reflect on the severity — and sources — of the information war that has gripped Musk's platform since the onset of Hamas' terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7.

Blame does not fall solely on bots for the spread of disinformation, faked images, and malicious misrepresentation of events about the Israel-Gaza conflict. Users exercising their version of free speech have been found culpable, too.

A post that recently circulated on X included a video described as footage of Hamas firing rockets from the Gaza Strip towards Israel.Reuters reported, however, that matching footage circulated in 2020 with Syria tagged as the location. The news agency added that the video did not depict the October 2023 conflict between Israel and Hamas.",,40,"{'like_count': 40, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-21 12:43:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyqUkWpIYcs/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393536806_716978580296636_2938763156781839626_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=8NCbVEw5oPsAX9t9Dga&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBwYV9e0vyz_Itf7X_OgBp9zhxbuafotOMSXQy5wQ0JFg&oe=653AD6CF

The Crown of Gilded Bones-
[#3 in Blood and Ash Series]
By Jennifer L Armentrout
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I’m fully hooked, there’s no turning back. I had every intention of breaking the books up and continuing with my October TBR, but I just don’t have the desire to pick anything else up until I know what happens in this series.  I’ve heard from a few that this book feels like “filler”, but I disagree, I think it was important to finally see a relationship officially develop between Poppy and Cas as well as set the stage for the impending conflict between Atlantia and the Blood Crown. There was plenty of revelations, twists, and romance to keep me intrigued ( if you read this book, you know this word appears frequently 🙄). I really wish that the “I have a question” dialogue would decrease in the next book, but I feel that is how we discover some of the world building, so I try to not let it annoy me too much. 

Did anyone move to “A Shadow in the Ember” after reading this or go straight to book four, The War of Two Queens?

instagram,"Good morning all at the start of a weekend of posting work that we will soon be showing off in London town ⁠at the @magan_gallery_london , 16 Trinity Road, London SW17 7RE (Tooting Bec Tube).⁠

Kicking off today's sharing is the work of Hao Wei @my.planet.wei ... below are her words explaining the thoughts behind her work;
⁠
As a surrealist, Hao is interested in the space between the dream and reality world. Jewellery could be a dream container as a boundary between daytime and nighttime, inner desire and the outside world.

Andre Breton believed that Surrealism could resolve the conflict that has always existed between dreams and reality and achieve an absolute reality, a transcendent reality. 

The structure of Hao’s theme is based on the narrative of personal dreams. It uses fictive metaphors to express subject-dimensional relationships. 

Metaphors are the graphic language of dream-making. The expression of metaphor enables the creative language of dreams to penetrate the creation of the material world, which enables our dream world and our real world to become a continuous space. 

When the subjective connection between the dream and real space is constructed, subjective mental cognition can be combined with the transcending of conventional knowledge to create a transcendent world.

Post-truth is a term coined in the Oxford dictionary in which people “respond more to feelings and beliefs than to facts.” This 21st-century phenomenon is present in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, where misinformation and disinformation are shaping the narratives over social media. 

It's a clear reminder of the vitality of verifying information and seeking the truth amidst the chaos of the digital age. Learn more about this post-truth era and the historical context behind the conflict by reading more using the stories link in our bio.

Egyptian state television showed several trucks entering the gate on the 15th day of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Gaza's Health Ministry says Israel's brutal retaliatory air and missile strikes have killed at least 4,137 Palestinians, including hundreds of children, while over a million of the besieged territory's 2.3 million people have been displaced.

It’s essential that climate advocates hear them out.

Between high-profile cases of extractive industries seizing and polluting Indigenous land and the fact that climate change exacerbates the many environmental and economic challenges facing Indigenous communities, the climate movement routinely finds common ground with Indigenous people. But recently, the two groups have found themselves at odds. The Yurok tribe recently succeeded in an effort to have four hydroelectric dams removed from the Klamath River in Northern California, where renewable energy production was disrupting salmon runs. A majority of Alaska Native communities supported the now-approved Willow drilling project in Alaska despite the project’s significant carbon emissions, harm to wildlife, and a viral TikTok movement that spurred a #StopWillow petition with 5.1 million signatures. This conflict over Chaco Canyon drilling could drive yet another wedge between climate zealots and Indigenous people.

Collaboration with these tribes is vital to the climate movement — Indigenous communities have centuries of knowledge regarding environmental stewardship, and often view nature as sacred. Their leadership can help ensure the most sensible and effective climate solutions get implemented.

When the Gaza hospital parking tragedy took place a few days ago, a group of us immediately thought about how the truth might be soon discovered through the work of the Forensic Architecture and/or my dear friend Lawrence Abu Hamdan. Then came the biased and opinionated letter of the art world against Israel, unfortunately, signed by both Eyal Wiseman the dir ctor of AF and Lawrence. Today came the news that Forensic Architecture has done a preliminary investigation, casting significant doubt on Israel’s version of what happened at the Chrisitan hospital. Unfortunately, by signing that letter, both AF and Lawrence have damaged their objective credibity in shedding light on the truth about the incident. Of course, people who have already made up their mind about Israel, and what happened at the hospital would cheer this report, but for those who don’t, this report does little to change their mind. would’ve been better if Eyalmand Lawrence had stayed out of making a Partisan decision about the war via the letter to actually be able to have a more productive intervention in matters much more crucial than the right and wrong of the conflict on a moral and political level?

instagram,"Read our editor-in-chief’s response to personal attacks made by an officer of @mesaiupui during a meeting of the @iupuiusg in regards to a recent article covering protests in downtown Indianapolis.

“We would like reconciliation with the officers and members of MESA, but not at the expense of truth, especially not in response to attempts to embarrass and malign us in public settings. That goes for any group that tries to sway our coverage, whether that be through financial incentive or popular pressure campaigns against our staff. 

We are all just students, trying to get our degrees and better ourselves. We can afford to be respectful of each other.

Lastly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is something I have studied for a long time. The longer I study it, the more I am convinced that my opinion is like carrying water to the sea. There is nothing I could say that has not already been said by people with far more education and knowledge than me. 

That is why the only public stances I have taken on the matter have not explicitly supported either side. I support peace, I want innocent people to be protected, and I want conflict de-escalated. 

I do not think praising, justifying, or “providing nuance” to the actions of t*rrorists does any of those things, and I hope that my fellow students, MESA officers, USG senators, and members of the Indianapolis community can understand and respect this perspective and the continued independence of The Collegiate Commons.”

instagram,"Those of you who know me or have followed me for a while know that social justice is integral to the work that I put out into the world and also who I am as a person. What’s happening in the world at the moment is absolutely devastating and the loss of life is also devastating. I feel like often there is a tendency to look like you HAVE to have an opinion on social media however equally I can’t show up in this space being my authentic self, as someone who is abhorrently against injustice without speaking out. 

In Feb 2022 amnesty international released a report detailing the system of apartheid being enacted against the Palestinian people by the Israeli government, something which has largely been ignored by western media and a lot of us in the west have been ignorant to. I only found out about the report a few months ago because I decided to take a short course on human rights. Palestinian people have slowly had their rights to movement, basic needs like water and citizenship stripped away. Something that has been happening way before a few weeks ago. 

I can’t come on this platform and be authentic without acknowledging this injustice yet also acknowledging that there are Jewish victims of this conflict and that the reality of war is that those who have the least power are the ones most affected. This post isn’t to demean or undermine or pick sides. But it’s to stand up against the language that our own government is using and I see being repeated across social platforms. Standing up for the rights of Palestinian people doesn’t equate to being anti-Semitic or pro-Hamas. You can acknowledge the actions of an individual group doesn’t equate to the actions of the entire Palestinian population and similarly the actions of the Israeli state doesn’t equate to the actions of the Jewish population . 

The people need to be protected and the rights of every individual needs to be taken into account and it requires us as individuals disavowing the actions of both the Israeli state and the actions of Hamas whilst acknowledging that there has been ongoing violations of injustice being thwart on the Palestinian people for some time and this can’t be ignored anymore.",,29,"{'like_count': 29, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 865}",Yvonne Hercules,,2023-10-21 11:54:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/270063534_1049940315787496_8333108651062747527_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=djmCVe-n0IwAX8bYuYe&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfByukPhFtC_5X_cmTMZeXk3mKfim5ZfgZA3yp3CVPxq6w&oe=655B538A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyqO9tYN2v9/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393470538_692065942585878_4492171384899311614_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ZF76b74ePvoAX_rqGSf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCb_WnXfuURjreLI_h357V8Godd5VRU2pmOwmHD5yJOVQ&oe=655A9104
instagram,"Our second early morning peek at who will be exhibiting with us when the @magan_gallery_london opens its doors on the 2nd of November is Jason Stein @jasonsteinmetals...

Jason is an American living in North Carolina, USA and is 1 of our 34 selected members chosen to exhibit their response to the theme 'The Space Between'.

Below is his thinking behind his wonderful work ...

My work explores the idea of control: both in the physical world and within our own consciousness. I am fascinated by the means of control we encounter and the unseen structures and systems that modify our experiential reality.

This tension between what is seen and unseen fascinates me, and my work occupies a space between what we show the world and what we choose to keep hidden within.

I employ chance and failure in my studio practice through the selective implementation and modification of the casting and brazing processes. Through this, I push materials and processes to their breaking point to

create new forms, and also utilize the subtle and subversive manipulation of found objects. This leads to juxtapositions and states of conflict and interplay between disparate elements such as order and chaos, the industrial and organic, beauty and destruction, adornment and protection.

The Space Between is at the @magan_gallery_london ⁠

They provided a Pinterest link of lifestyle photos for inspiration, some of the shots are on the moodboard slide on this post. Photos on slides 6 and 7 color edited. Originals from @pexels . Color palette for the pitch was pulled from the lifestyle photos on Pinterest provided by agency. Also said they liked NastyGal and Revolve Clothing and to check out those brands' aesthetics.

instagram,"The heavy security atmosphere on Ocotber 20 can be related to a wave of crackdown against the Sunni community, particularly dissident Sunni clerics and their close circles, including arrests and travel bans, especially since the Israel-Hamas conflict began earlier in the month.

HaalVsh, a website dedicated to human rights and events in Sistan-Baluchestan, reported violent arrests and mass detention of people around the Makki Mosque. “Security and military forces have surrounded the mosque and are attempting to enter,” it said.

Citing local sources, HaalVsh said security forces are transferring detained people with military as well as personal vehicles, while some of these people have been injured during the clashes with the forces.

In the footage from the protests, gunshots are heard, and security forces use teargas to control the crowd. In one of the videos, a group of regime forces, military vehicles and motorbikes are seen moving in a street as protesters surround them from both ends of the street.Iranian security forces attacked people in the Sunni-majority city of Zahedan in the southeast, and arrested many who wanted to hold rallies after Friday prayers.

Since Friday morning, security was tense around the Makki Jameh Mosque of Zahedan, where outspoken Sunni leader Mowlavi Abdolhamid weekly delivers fiery sermons criticizing the Islamic Republic and its policies. The people of the Sistan-Baluchestan, with Zahedan as provincial capital, have been holding weekly protests after security forces opened fire at peaceful protesters, killing nearly 100 on September 30, 2022, a day known as the Bloody Friday of Zahedan.

Abdolhamid has repeatedly called for an end to repression in the past one year and respect for civic and human rights in Iran.In another video, people are heard chanting “Not Gaza, Not Lebanon, I will die for Iran,” a common slogan in rallies against the Islamic Republic, which is the main sponsor of regional Islamist militias such as Hamas, which instigated the bloody war in the Middle East earlier in October.

During the Friday prayer sermons, Mowlavi Abdolhamid, who rejected the regime’s goal of destroying Israel the previous Friday, reiterat",,27,"{'like_count': 26, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 7670}",glbl_jhd_dly_mntr,,2023-10-21 01:12:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/13129393_1007939159293798_949321728_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NYXzYkJMI4YAX9oxTN8&_nc_oc=AQn8i4PaJvQCN0TL8sCI1Y0uUtKcbxdjJ3tLzph32VdqyrdlC3C7kpp12n6Dn2-4afo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB5dZugPZ_ERWZl1dr1NnL59qS0ML_xLs9w00gGrcjEiQ&oe=655B4E29,https://www.instagram.com/p/CypFj44xQLM/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394670272_1075283216815314_3748156282126732864_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=8UGw5GLswvEAX8dtNRb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDAX5KC7PoLG-uwvGck05lQHndXmk4dHpyq6vPWl120Fw&oe=653B4FEE
instagram,"Where the sky is painted with some dark clouds, a radiant rainbow shines through. We find ourselves contemplating the heart-wrenching events unfolding in Israel and Gaza. It’s a stark reminder of the fragility of peace and the resilience of humanity.

As we witness the turmoil and pain suffered by those directly affected, it’s essential to take a moment and reflect. We hold close the ones who bear the weight of this conflict in their hearts, for they are our friends, our family, and our fellow human beings.

In these troubling times, we are reminded of the privileges we often take for granted – the privilege to go to work, to attend school, to share meals with loved ones, to socialize with friends, to enjoy movies and concerts. It is a stark contrast to the lives disrupted by conflict.

Let us not forget the power of empathy and the strength of unity. While we may not have all the answers, we can stand together in support, offering our thoughts, prayers, and efforts toward a more peaceful world.

May this moment be a catalyst for gratitude and action, as we extend our hearts to those in need and work towards a world where everyone can enjoy these simple privileges without fear. 🕊️🇮🇱

instagram,"As I go on and live my normal life, which indicates how privileged one is to have a normal life in the first place, my heart keeps going back to Palestine and Israel. The agony of war is deeply painful.  We belong to the same world, and as a global citizen living a thousand miles away, I’m swamped with feelings of hopelessness and despair. Homes are wrecked, lives have been lost and children become orphans. 💔

As we go with our routine, faced with the stark realization that children and families affected by this conflict may never see their loved ones again, it is pertinent that we end this carnage and raise our voices for peace. ☮️

When will we realize the futility of killing and the brutality of it all? 

😥💔 ☮️

instagram,"Calls for peace are growing louder amid intensifying demands for further action from the White House. Inside the U.S. Capitol building this week, rabbis were among those arrested as a group took over the rotunda, demanding the U.S. broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. In New York, there was a massive gathering calling for Hamas’ release of all hostages. ""They dragged 200 innocent Israelis into the hell of Hamas captivity, so that their crime against humanity could continue every day,"" said Elan Carr, CEO of the Israel American Council. 
Meanwhile in Illinois, Palestinian Americans grew angry at a vigil for a Palestinian American boy killed in what police say was a hate crime. As protesters demand more aggressive action from the White House, administration officials are urging calm. A recent explosion at a Gaza hospital was initially blamed on Israel, which later blamed the group Palestine Islamic Jihad — illustrating the need, they say, for calm in the fog of war. ""I think this is a cautionary note for governments in the region, frankly, for press in responding to each and every twist and turn in this conflict. And there'll be more of these to come. It is important that people do not react immediately, or overreact immediately to first reports in a time of war,"" said Jon Finer, the principal deputy national security adviser.Still, competing narratives of the conflict are even causing legal sparring. Starbucks and a union representing its workers are suing each other over the union’s social media posts in support of Palestinians. Union leaders say it was put up without authorization and are suing Starbucks for defamation – for suggesting they support terrorism, they say.

Starbucks and the union representing its workers, Workers United, entered into a legal dispute on Wednesday. This disagreement arose following a social media post related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. In response, Starbucks filed a lawsuit against Workers United in a federal court in Iowa. 

The company alleges that a pro-Palestinian message posted from a union account during the early stages of the Israel-Hamas conflict caused frustration among hundreds of customers and negatively impacted Starbucks' reputation.

“Starbucks unequivocally condemns acts of hate, terrorism and violence,” said Starbucks Executive Vice President Sara Kelly. This is not helping the rumors that led Starbucks to claim in 2014 that ""Rumors that Starbucks or Howard provides financial support to the Israeli government and/or the Israeli Army are unequivocally false.""",,23,"{'like_count': 23, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 1228}",The Revolution Report,,2023-10-21 18:26:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/387265891_1544631692741904_6262299668615517148_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=b2ySh-Uyh6QAX8RbrPz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDi2K0nVgI77osfpM_SAMfSOcBL5hQErnA3bwrYod-nhg&oe=655B08A2,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyq73c2u467/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/394086654_321409477364308_1210776768594830174_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SDAj0Mwvbd0AX8q73Nj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCr_fjDjbT12MS9CbyEvueK5MVVxpwL9bKlP0MEWBXvew&oe=65487311

instagram,"CHRISTMAS IN COCONUT CREEK by @karissakinwordwrites: a spoiler-free review!🌴
RATING: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Another brief detour from fall recs BECAUSE!

KARISSA KINWORD. YOU’VE DONE IT AGAIN.

I loved, LOVED, Forget Me Not so very much. I knew everything Karissa wrote would be an auto-buy for me, and this STILL blew me out of the water!

This cozy little Christmas rom-com hits every sweet spot we’re looking for in its genre, and it also does so much more. Imagine a hallmark Christmas movie, but make it more heartfelt, with unending witty and hilarious banter, some incredibly heartwarming friendships, beautiful character backstories, and a walloping dollop of SPICE🌶️💋

This book starts off running. The initial meet cute is completely hilarious, and Ophelia & Frankie’s chemistry is both filled to the brim with tension & also somehow feels so natural. Everything from here had me squirming & squealing, laughing & swooning. I love Ophelia and Frankie even separate from each other. Ophelia is charming & kind but also fiesty & unwilling to take any shit. Her friendship with Natalia is so sweet, fun and unconditionally supportive. Frankie & Mateo also have the most heartwarming relationship, and gives us the perfect scene to get to know our quiet and reserved MMC who becomes absolutely feral behind closed doors 👀

All of this wraps up with the sweetest and most hard-won HEA. We have no silly miscommunication, no unnecessary conflict, just two people who love each other overcoming natural obstacles in order to be together. I loved every hilarious, steamy, holiday bedecked & charming minute. Christmas in Coconut Creek releases on 10/24 and will be available on KU!

Thank you endlessly to @karissakinwordwrites for this early copy 🥹

QOTD: what are your favorite book character friendships? 🌴

If my posts or opinions have hurt any of my jewish and non-jewish friends. I with great sincerety apologize for causing you discomfort. I have love for all human life. Without question I view children as the most vulnerable and precious life that needs to be protected at all costs. Regardless of what side you support in any conflict. With that said, I wont go into a lengthy message other than to say. The images I posted were very disturbing. It was reckless for me to do so as it paints a very negative picture of an entire people whom I know are not all that way. We need to love each other enough to never want to kill each other. There is to much violence in the world already. I hope that we as a world can respect each other and look at our objectives honestly and ask ourselves. Is the prize worth the taking of an innocent life? Love is the answer, if you have that, then you have all that you need. We are inching closer to armageddon.

instagram,"In the quiet hours of the night, as I work far from home, my heart aches for the ones caught in the crossfire of conflict, their lives shattered by the harsh realities of war. 

✨ Early mornings, Late nights, and endless work sessions are a familiar sight for many expats like me, trying to find solace amidst the chaos of the world. 

🏠  Living far from home, the fear of the unknown looms large, especially for our families, friends, and souls enduring unimaginable pain and loss. 

Yet, it's in these moments of uncertainty that we channel our inner strength and foster our resilience, dedicating ourselves to our meaningful professions:
💻  Our laptops glow in the darkness, not just with the light of screens, but with the hope that our efforts, no matter how small, can make a difference.

Through the persistent day-night-grind, I am confronting the job market challenges head-on, assisting job seekers to find hope in career paths while my heart aches for those shattered by war. Each resume renovated, every interview coached, carries a silent wish for peace, safety, and justice.

🤝 Let's work together for a brighter, compassionate world.

instagram,"The Value of Each Other

As much as the world around us tries to lure us into self-dependency, God created us for each other. For community. For a life that’s not alone.

The author of Proverbs said it like this:

“A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity.”
Proverbs‬ ‭17:17‬ ‭NIV

We’ll all face hard times—sometimes when we least expect it. But a friend’s genuine care can mean the world, a sibling’s unconditional love can’t be replaced, and a neighbor’s practical help is priceless. 

We need each other more than we realize: emotionally, practically, and spiritually.

If you’ve found yourself in a busy season where you’ve unintentionally neglected your true friends or been too busy for your real family, now is the time to reprioritize.

If there’s unresolved conflict with a friend or family member, and it’s slowly deteriorating the relationship, now is the time to set aside your pride and choose to make things right.

If you’re silently struggling alone, now is the moment to let someone in. Give them a call, send them a text, or show up on their doorstep. If you can’t be honest and vulnerable, it will be difficult to get help.

Not only do you need people, but those same people need you.

You have strengths, gifts, talents, and a personality that’s unique to you and beneficial to them—and vice versa. Why bury them in the ground, in the name of autonomy, when they can benefit others?

Sometimes we need to ask for help, and sometimes we need to be the help. Do you need help, or can you offer it? Could you use a hand, or do you have some time, money, advice, or expertise? 

If you’re tempted to self-isolate, don’t forget: we were meant to live life together.

instagram,"One of the things that gives me the hick the most is seeing people who claim to be healers not share their gifts with the world when it needs them the most. 

This silence is worrisome yet sheds a light on who is really in for the healing and upgrade of Earth and who is simply not there yet.

I understand that most of us are empats and it might indeed be very hard to show up in moments of global distress. I get it. I am one too.

Said this, it is our duty to do the work in our self to then be able to hold who and what needs our assistance.

This also relates very much to people who don’t do this as a profession. Yes, you can help too.

Our energy is contagious: if our frequency is low we cannot possibly support the one of others who might need support. It really comes down to quantum physics.

So how do you raise your frequency so to support yourself and your community?

You mediate, you move your body, you do breath work, mantras and use all the somatic tools that can support you calm your nervous system down and literally move stuck energy in your body. 

(These are just examples and it will be up to you to try different tools to see what resonates more to you. The healing path is not the same for everyone, this is why I constantly stress the benefits of working 1:1 with a practitioner).

But you can bring it a step forward and you can teach your communities the same somatic techniques you used on yourself and tell them to pass them along…this has the power to heal maybe just one person, maybe “just” a community, maybe the whole world.

Regardless of your stand in this conflict, but especially if it is one that is divisive, I encourage you to work on your shadows through somatic work so to help you support yourself and your community.

Once you do the work, you will clearly see that what we are experiencing in the world, which do not limit themselves to what we are seeing in P@lestine and !srael, are merely political and being divisive only supports their aggravation. I beg you to look at the bigger picture.

God rich in mercy and love,
We pray for the people of Israel and Gaza.
For the innocents, broken, scared, frightened, confused.
God who weeps with the weeping, have mercy.

We think of those who have lost their lives and those who grieve.
God who meets us in the darkness of the valley and in the stillness of the night,
Oh God, meet with the bereaved.

For families shattered and children torn,
Oh God, have mercy.
To the injured, bring healing.
To the bereaved, bring comfort.
To the frightened, bring love.
To the weary, bring hope.

God of grace, we pray for an end to bloodshed.
May peace come quickly.
We pray that peacemakers may find a voice and offer a way forward.
Father, have mercy.
Lord Christ, have mercy.
Holy Spirit, bring hope.
Amen

Op deze avond toont Salman 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘥, een surrealistische-poëtische film waarin twee jonge mannen een auto-ongeluk veroorzaken die ze niet konden voorzien. Ze worden hierdoor geconfronteerd met een ethisch conflict: helpen we het slachtoffer of gaan we door? Daarnaast laat hij het dansstuk 𝘏𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘯 zien.

We work in hospitality, it’s our job to be people pleasers, right?

Wrong.

It’s our job to ensure customers have a fabulous experience, but it’s also our personal responsibility to ensure we set healthy boundaries.

If you find yourself doing the following, you might just be a people pleaser:
✔️ Wanting to be liked by everybody
✔️ Being Agreeable
✔️ Apologising frequently
✔️ Putting others’ needs before your own
✔️ Avoiding conflict
✔️ Not sharing your opinion

We have the ability to shift out of people pleasing, and it often starts with the way we communicate. Little changes here and there with our mindset, can make all the difference.

Do you have any phrase suggestions to add to our list?

instagram,"Early in 2003, @leymahgbowee met with six other women in a makeshift office/conference room to discuss the Liberian civil war and the fast-approaching war on the capital Monrovia. Armed with nothing but their conviction and 10 United States dollars, the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace campaign was born. ⁠
⁠
""We worked daily confronting warlords, meeting with dictators, and refusing to be silenced in the face of AK-47s and RPGs. We walked when we had no transportation, we fasted when water was unaffordable, we held hands in the face of danger, we spoke truth to power when everyone else was being diplomatic, we stood under the rain and the sun with our children to tell the world the stories of the other side of the conflict. Our educational backgrounds, travel experiences, faiths, and social classes did not matter. We had a common agenda: Peace for Liberia Now."" ⁠
⁠
In 2011 Leymah Gbowee was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work leading the campaign. In her acceptance speech, she reflected on leading the nonviolent women's movement that was pivotal in ending Liberia's 14-year civil war in 2003: ""We succeeded when no one thought we would; we were the conscience of the ones who had lost their consciences in their quest for power and political positions. We represented the soul of the nation. No one would have prepared my sisters and me for today — that our struggle would go down in the history of this world. Rather, when confronting warlords, we did so because we felt it was our moral duty to stand as mothers and gird our waist, to fight the demons of war in order to protect the lives of our children, their land, and their future.""⁠
⁠
In her speech and through her actions, Gbowee reminds us of the role that individuals can play in achieving peace.⁠

instagram,"According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), since violence erupted between Israel and Hamas on October 7th, at least 22 journalists have been killed.

The CPJ reported that, as of October 20, 18 Palestinian, three Israeli, and one Lebanese journalist had died since Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, followed by the ongoing bombardments of Gaza by Israel.

The 22 journalists were among the more than 4,000 dead on both sides since the war began on October 7, with hundreds killed in Tuesday’s hospital blast in Gaza.

The CPJ attributed two of these fatalities to Hamas attacks in southern Israel and 15 of these deaths to Israeli airstrikes. According to reports, eight journalists have been hurt, and three more are either missing or in custody.

“CPJ emphasizes that journalists are civilians doing important work during times of crisis and must not be targeted by warring parties,” said Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. “Journalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heartbreaking conflict. All parties must take steps to ensure their safety.”

The CPJ said that it was probing ""numerous unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt or threatened, and of damage to media offices and journalists’ homes"".

𝙍𝙚𝙛𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩, today, upon how you work to resolve conflict when it arises. Are you more like the Pharisees and Herodians whose only goal was to trick, trap and win? Do you see the other as an enemy in those moments? Or do you strive to be like Jesus who didn’t shy away from the conversation, answering honestly and directly? Of course, the truth was easy for Jesus since He was without any fault. In our lives, the truth may require that we admit our sin and apologize when confronted. However, if the truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth is our goal, then our conversations will imitate Jesus and, most often, a peaceful resolution will ensue.

My truthful Lord, Your wisdom is perfect and Your words are truth. Please give me the gifts of wisdom and all truth, especially when conflicts arise. In those moments, please keep me from reacting in an angry and defensive way so that I can always be an instrument of the unity You desire. Jesus, I trust in You.

instagram,"Follow the #VirtualBookTour for In Truth, Madness by Imran Khan @imranism  @breakthrough_book_collective 

The perfect read for Neil Gaiman fans. 

Meet Malek Khalil, a brilliant reporter with decades of experience in the field, and a man on the edge. Where there is war, natural disaster or political crisis, Malek is in the midst of it, but years of conflict reporting have taken their toll and he is slowly unravelling. 
His colleagues, Neeka and Justin, have noticed a change in him, beyond even his usual vivid imagination. Neeka is especially sensitive, having been his friend and producer for many years, and perhaps knowing him better than he knows himself. Justin, a skilled and brave cameraman, has worked with them for just as long and the three make a formidable team - but they are only as strong as each other - and Malek is fast going down the rabbit hole.

Born a Muslim but an atheist to his core, Malek's voyage takes him around the world and back in time to ancient Babylon, as he finds himself arguing with a God in whom he does not believe. A keen reader, his 'madness' is heightened by a strange book that keeps appearing on his Kindle, telling the stories of people he has briefly encountered during his career.

In Truth, Madness takes place in the Middle East, South Asia and London against a backdrop of war, religion, political skullduggery and emerging love, taking the reader on a tumultuous journey through the most dangerous arenas of modern culture and the ancient world. 

Is Malek losing his mind, or is he experiencing an astonishing kind of truth? 

Our hosts on Monday will be @afelton6212  and @littlethaosbookshelf

And also not when you’re living in Jerusalem where such sirens are unusual even during terror attacks. What’s usual, in fact, are random alarms going off in downtown neighbourhoods like mine, shattering the quietness of Shabbat weekend mornings. All one is left to do is mutter a curse and try to go back to sleep, or simply grow immune towards the intrusion.

Link in Bio☝

Everyone knows Dave Mustaine as one of the best metal guitarists of all time. With a career spanning several decades, he has already made his mark in the world of metal, both as the guitarist and frontman of one of the big four metal bands: the iconic Megadeth. 

While Dave's contributions to the genre are unquestionable, many moments of feud, turmoil, and conflict shaped the narrative of his musical journey. Like many other legendary figures in the music industry, Dave wasn't exempt from criticism and scrutiny from musicians from other bands – especially because of his attitude and persona behind (and even in front) the scenes. 

In this video, we'll uncover more about the legendary guitarist through his feud and conflicts with members of other bands.

instagram,"Children kidnapped by Palestinians (Hamas, PIJ, random citizens)  on October 7th held as ""captives"" in Gasa. I believe no childe should be taken hostage or killed in a conflict. Others were murdered and molested by Palestinians residing in Gasa on that date.  First free these innocent civilians. I believe some countries in the area have enough leverage and influence to free the uninvolved citizens: women, children, elders, and others.

instagram,"This is a common misconception that most people have when they hear the word “transformation”

Especially for women.

But the truth is, a transformation is more than that.

It’s both a physical change and a mental one.

And for Ashley, this was just as much about proving something to herself and creating a positive mindset…

As it was about losing body fat or gaining lean muscle.

When Ashley started her journey with us, she was already very active being a triathlete.

She ran 3x a week...

Cycled 3x a week...

And swam once a week.

But Ashley always felt like she was falling short of achieving her best.

There was a constant conflict of challenging herself and then feeling disappointed by the result.

On top of that, she felt those around her didn’t ‘get’ why she lead this lifestyle.

Which left her feeling isolated from her friends and family, always questioning her reason for wanting more from herself.

But under the guidance of Head Female Coach Jade…

Ashely’s mindset started to change along with her physique.

She suddenly had the support of a coach who understood her drive for perfection…

And this pushed her to not only an amazing physical transformation where she cut fat AND gained muscle at the same time…

But also took her to a place of feeling accomplished.

Like she was no longer slamming her head against an invisible wall.

With a new fire burning inside, Ashley finally feels like all the hard work she puts in is paying off.

She now has a body she can love, but more importantly, FEELS like the athlete she’s always strived to be.

One that isn’t ridiculed or questioned, but instead can be an inspiring mother to her kids.

Great work Ashley and Coach Jade.

We don’t just do weight loss…

We change lives.

October 20, 2023, was the 3rd anniversary of EndSars. What has changed? Whatever happened to the camera that Babatunde Fashola found at the Lekki tollgate? On that day in 2020, did anybody know that Bola Tinubu would be in Aso Rock three years later?

The Supreme Court will begin its sitting to look at the appeals brought by Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi. One central question for the apex court is whether it will accept new evidence against Tinubu and INEC in this case. While the court tries the case, Nigerians will place the court on trial. What are the possible outcomes and the risks associated with each?

In a last-minute effort, Pres. Bola Tinubu sues to stop the FBI, IRS, Justice Department, and others from releasing the over 2,500 documents on him in their possession as part of a Freedom of Information request.

What is the problem with Sheik Gumi? Why is a one-time medical student very simplistic in his pronouncements on Nigeria?

He is a Boston-based award-winning Nigerian filmmaker. He just completed a movie called ""Theory of Conflict."" It is about a group of students at a Boston college who set aside their differences to face a spillover of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict tearing their campus apart. Rahman Oladigbolu will join us on HaveYourSay247 on Saturday, October 21, 2023, at 6:00 PM Nigerian Time and 1:00 PM New York Time to discuss world ethnic and religious conflicts within the backdrop of today's Israeli-Hamas war.

The situation is tense in the region. Our thoughts are with the people suffering and most affected. 

We are sad, we are stressed, we are scared - mostly we feel helpless. Each hour that goes by brings a possibility of conflict spilling over.

We have to be strong – not for us but for the animals that depend on us. We have over 100 cats and dogs, two young lions, six baboons, and other wildlife we are working on. Lions scheduled to leave to a sanctuary in South Africa, baboons to a sanctuary in the UK, cats and dogs to various countries. These trips are now at risk and we fear they might be stuck.

We are now receiving dozens of requests per day for help with people leaving Lebanon with their pets. We are helping make sure they have the right documents and permits, buy traveling cages, making flight reservations, or updating veterinary records so they are prepared in case they need to leave suddenly. 

We are trying to build up a three-to-six-month supply for our own animals and so we can help the community.

We have to be prepared in case the situation gets worse.

instagram,"We've been pretty quiet about what's happening in the world, trying to keep this a place of positivity and light. At the same time, we can't ignore the devastation that is occurring in Israel and Palestine. I'll be frank and say that, while I am no pacificist, the reaction of violence to meet violence is abhorrent, and the full breadth of a greater force's power to meet the attack of a smaller force is extreme, unnecessary, and against God.

As LGBTQIA2S+ people, we know what it is like to be considered less than human. We know what it is like to experience the violence of others for their own sport. We know what it is like to have others tell us to just be calm, to not be angry, and to work for peace in a conflict we did not start. Even more, we know what it is like to have ""spokespeople"" misconstrue our wishes, our voices, and our very selves in their efforts to gain recognition. This conflict, at its core, is not strange to us. 

And so, we pray for peace. Not cheap peace. Not the sort of peace that comes at the expense of marginalized people and to the benefit of those already filled with power. Not a peace that pleases the leaders of nations but leaves their people captive to the desires of a very slim few. We pray for true peace, the kind of peace that comes with justice, the kind of peace that is hard work to achieve, the kind that requires sacrifice and vulnerability, and the kind that leads to true and deep reconciliation. We pray for the kind of peace that comes with the quiet flaps of the wings of the Spirit, landing with God's gentleness among the cacophony of war, bringing all to a standstill. And, as we discuss this issue from positions of great privilege and safety, God, make us gentle - slow to judge, and quick to care.",,9,"{'like_count': 7, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 486}",Technicolor Ministries,,2023-10-21 13:34:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/274961325_744352073193390_3305898047119128716_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=MtnyPORPRJ4AX--K5ef&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDeGr45ZGmwIUrxyfvJNR6yfJtPhLPKcOR2CGp7C2yf4A&oe=6559C13E,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyqadGxs2Hy/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/394539216_332251116150767_6651691335532647361_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qGFfcdNSjC8AX9eIDvh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDG5fnrCfa7DefFYmlrnALPSylN7x3QrgfnTObGj283Mg&oe=654B53EE

It’s rubbish 🗑️

Why?

👉 Because your coparent’s agenda is to mess with you, not to cooperate. 

The traditional way of doing things doesn’t account for people who thrive on chaos.

instagram,"Making art has always been a way for me to make sense of my emotions and to better understand others. I am grateful that I have the opportunities to continue doing so, and to simply exist without fear for my life.
-
I said this in a story, but I think it’s important to repeat: Though I won’t pretend to understand the deep history and nuance of this conflict, I do know that war crimes & the desecration of life are always grave tragedies.
-
I believe that all people are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:26), meaning that each person is a reflection of the Father, Son, & Spirit, and have inherent dignity, beauty, and worth. 
Yet, we see examples of the ways in which humankind has fallen far, constantly displaying our brokenness against each other; horrendous events like these are a crushing reminder of that.
-
I do not intend to make political statements, just to express my grief over the senseless violence against innocent victims on both sides being faced with the aftermath of decisions that were and are completely out of their control. Condemning evil can be done without dehumanizing entire people groups.
-
Jesus of Nazareth was and is the Prince of Peace and the God of Justice, and what I cling to in dark days (even with fingers that feel like they are slipping at times) is that He is the “man of sorrows and acquainted with grief” —Isaiah 53:3. He weeps with us even while there is eternal hope (Lazarus in John 11); His return means that wickedness and death itself will be buried in the end.",,9,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 19632}",Natalie Fong Malis,,2023-10-21 17:37:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/393243544_840616364321063_6167856676581113865_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Gpbj-K3RxxMAX_1N1zN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBsx_peO991xXa2uUGVI3yZ_EW_Iyhq5iez8rKh64Bgqg&oe=655BA85C,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyq2NyRpFWB/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393629643_1332849624013985_3932350327268146833_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=2raMB2_xF5AAX8U4mjS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDBT-r5yQWSghdHcYqZyGecoLkmi5ivw3UkASbmw7eanQ&oe=655A95E0
instagram,"#OutlookMagazine | During my 2022 fellowship in Jerusalem, a city entrenched in contemporary conflict, I frequently crossed the tall borders that separated the Israel and Palestinian communities. In just two weeks, the city’s complex tapestry of human behaviour based on religious and racial differences became evident. Our introduction to the city was unapologetically immersive, with our abode located near the old city, a place where people of all Abrahamic religions coexist, sharing food, spices, crafts, and a history of religious supremacy.

Jen was kind enough to share my friends Fundraiser. As she's said this conflict we need to remember the collective humanity of all who are suffering under Governments or Organisations they may not agree with. 

Too many lives have been lost. We need collective human responsibility not collective punishments. 

The wise seek solution, the ignorant only cast blame.

Anastasia Samoylovas first solo exhibition in France opened at PHAKT - Cultural Center in Rennes today.

From 13 October to 22 December & you can visit the artist’s show ""FloodZone"".

—

FloodZone, the first solo exhibition in France by American artist Anastasia Samoylova, is a photographic narrative exploring the problem of rising sea levels in an area south of Florida.

FloodZone was initiated when the artist moved to Miami in 2016. Through daily walks, Anastasia Samoylova began to reflect on the growing conflict between the booming tourist and property market and the regular intrusion of the ocean on its coastline, as in 2017 when the city was particularly devastated by Hurricane Irma.

While the economic forces at work contribute to a feeling of denial and disavowal, Anastasia Samoylova's photographs convey what it feels like to live in a paradise teetering on the brink of disaster.

As part of the @glaz.festival photography festival
With the support of the Guernsey Photography Festival and Guernsey Museum

Special thanks to @jchristophe_godet

instagram,"Meta has apologised after for adding ""Terrorist"" into the profile bios of some Instagram users describing themselves as Palestinian. In a blog post, Meta said it fixed a ""problem"" faced by some Instagram users, with the word ""Palestinian"" written in English on their profile, the Palestinian flag emoji, and the word ""Alhumdullillah"" written in Arabic. When auto- translated to English, the phrase read: ""Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom."" A tiktok user posted about the issue, nothing that different combinations still translated to ""Terrorist. ""
@khanman1996 said in his posts that he was not Palestinian himself but tested the error out after being told about it by an unnamed Palestinian friend. The platform also gives accusations of suppressing content voicing support for Palestinian during the Israel-Gaza conflict.

instagram,"Middle East Airlines Moves Most of its Planes from Lebanon

Lebanese carrier Middle East Airlines (MEA) decided to move a number of its airplanes to neighboring countries as a precaution in case of conflict, thus reducing the number of its daily flights from and to Beirut.

The decision came after changes to the company’s insurance coverage policy following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

MEA said it was informed by the insurance companies about a decision to reduce their war risk coverage.

Mohammed Al-Hout, chairman of MEA, said only eight of the company’s 22 planes would operate as of next week, with the rest relocated to other airports.

Only one-third of the company’s flights scheduled before the crisis will remain operational.

instagram,"Two-state solution supported by HM King only guarantor for regional stability: Speaker

Manama, Oct. 21 (BNA): Ahmed bin Salman Al Musallam, Speaker of the Council of Representatives, has affirmed that the supportive stance of the Kingdom of Bahrain, under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and the support of His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister, towards the Palestinians is unequivocal.

He indicated that Bahrain firmly supports the Palestinian people’s legitimate rights to establish their independent state, and believes that there would be no stability in the Middle East without securing those rights to the Palestinians.

He pointed out that HM King Hamad always affirmed that the two-state solution is the only guarantor for promoting coexistence and ending the conflict, and that diplomacy is the only way to settle all disputes, adding that the kingdom backs all Arab, regional and international efforts to contain the dangerous crisis and halt the ongoing military operations across the Palestinian territories.

Speaker Al Musallam underlined parliamentary support for HM the King’s call for providing protection for innocent civilians from both sides, releasing all detainees and hostages, facilitating entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, as per the International Humanitarian Law, and categorical rejection of the displacement of Gazans from their lands. He said this was the only feasible track to spare the region a humanitarian catastrophe of endless repercussions.

ABOUT THE BOOK

Ballet is Aisha’s life. But when discrimination at her elite academy pushes her to her breaking point, she decides to pivot. At her new public arts school, Aisha scores more dance opportunities than she’s ever had before. And it doesn’t hurt that she gets to take classes with her bestie . . . and with Ollie, an adorably shy musician who keeps throwing off her usually impeccable balance.

Yet even as Aisha navigates friendships, family conflict, and first love, questions about her dance career open up new and old wounds. Aisha must find strength in herself and place her trust in others to make her next move.

instagram,"Following The Cairo Peace Summit that took place today at The New Capital, the Spokesperson for the Egyptian Presidency published an official statement confirming the following: 

The Arab Republic of Egypt, which took the initiative to call for the Peace Summit, expresses its deep appreciation to the countries and organizations that responded to the invitation despite time constraints.
 
On this occasion, it confirms that it will spare no effort in continuing to work with all partners in order to achieve the goals that called for holding this summit, regardless of the difficulties or the duration of the conflict. Egypt will always maintain its firm position in support of Palestinian rights, believing in peace as a strategic and irreversible option until the vision of a two-state solution, Palestinian and Israeli, living side by side is realized.
 
Within the framework of Egypt’s efforts to achieve these noble goals, it will never accept calls to liquidate the Palestinian cause at the expense of any country in the region. It will not relent for a moment in safeguarding its sovereignty and national security under increasingly dangerous and threatening circumstances and situations, relying on the help of Allah Almighty and the will and determination of its people.

instagram,"Posted @withregram • @middleeasteye London’s Metropolitan Police on Friday said they will not be arresting anyone chanting a popular slogan used by Palestinian activists during demonstrations.

The slogan in question, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, is commonly heard at solidarity marches and refers to the area of historic Palestine between the River Tiberias and the Mediterranean Sea.

Pro-Israel groups claim it is antisemitic because it is an implicit call for the destruction of Israel, a charge rejected by Palestinian activists.

The police force’s guidance comes ahead of what are expected to be large demonstrations in support of Palestinians on Saturday.

Passions have been running high in the UK as the conflict in Gaza rages on. Palestinian activists have previously expressed concerns about the criminalisation of political expression and free speech when it comes to criticising Israel.

Earlier in October, British Home Secretary Suella Braverman advised police forces across the country to look into the possibility of whether the waving of Palestinian flags amounted to a criminal offence.

“Behaviours that are legitimate in some circumstances, for example, the waving of a Palestinian flag, may not be legitimate such as when intended to glorify acts of terrorism,” she wrote in a letter to police chiefs.

As things stand, under British law, expressions of support for proscribed groups, such as Hamas or Hezbollah, can lead to arrest with the possibility of fines and prison sentences for those convicted of an offence.

The civil rights group Liberty has condemned what it calls the government’s attack on “the ability to stand up for what we believe in is our fundamental right”.

“Recent government responses to protests relating to Israel and Palestine are an attack on that right, and an attempt to erode the way we can make our voices heard,” the group said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter.",,3,"{'like_count': 2, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 312}",ClaudiaNelmsRJ,,2023-10-21 02:13:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/339541219_241175734975995_277266168015279906_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=BuWV9uHTSKgAX9FtMEC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAOvpl71G1ayI0ucffnerorSHsst9JKzgsNY4_YRDqlyA&oe=6559DE05,https://www.instagram.com/p/CypMjGdoywv/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393651684_287886127501506_5240311566342780013_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9oEXaEPhJssAX-gOseG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBOl183R3Ng3biBbN-aMfQto4-34gcAx5bnLiyda63K1g&oe=65406824

instagram,"English footballing legend Sir Bobby Charlton has sadly passed away, aged 86. Our thoughts are with Sir Bobby’s family, friends and everyone connected with Manchester United at this time. Words cannot do justice to the impact Sir Bobby Charlton had on the trajectory of both Manchester United and the English game as a whole, but we feel it’s only right to pay homage to one of the greatest ever. World Cup winner. Ballon d’Or winner. European Cup winner. The long-time record goalscorer for both Manchester United and England. Just 20-years-old when he survived the tragic Munich air disaster, drawing strength from those around him and championing an era which acted as a catalyst for Manchester United’s future success. And, whilst his legacy was crafted on the pitch, it was only further cemented by his achievements outside the game. Founded the ‘Find a Better Way’ charity in 2011, having seen first-hand the humanitarian damage caused by landmines on visits to Cambodia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Created the Sir Bobby Charlton Foundation, also, to help those whose lives have been affected by conflict and war. Awarded an OBE in 1969 and CBE in 1974, before receiving his knighthood in 1994. The English game was gifted a figure much bigger than football and a legend in every sense of the word.

 H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Chairperson of the Dubai Culture and Arts Authority and Member of the Dubai Council, today visited the ‘Tarahum for Gaza’ campaign centre in Dubai where she met with volunteers and participated in packing relief packages.
A total of 2,600 volunteers helped prepare more than 7,500 relief packages for the relief campaign. These packages were intended to provide support and demonstrate solidarity with Palestinians who have been affected by the ongoing conflict in Gaza.
Organised at Qalaat Alremaal Events in Dubai, the community event, overseen by Dubai Cares, part of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives, saw volunteers, including citizens and residents of all ages and nationalities volunteer their time to prepare food and relief kits for babies and women. Her Excellency Hessa bint Essa Buhumaid, Director General of Dubai’s Community Development Authority also accompanied HH Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed during the visit.
The 'Tarahum for Gaza' campaign, initiated just last week aims to express solidarity with Palestinians suffering from the current conflict and alleviate the harsh humanitarian conditions and suffering faced by the most vulnerable groups. Among these vulnerable groups, children represent a significant portion, with over 1 million children constituting more than half of the Gaza Strip’s population.
The campaign is supervised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in cooperation with the Emirates Red Crescent Authority and the World Food Programme, and in coordination with the Ministry of Community Development. The initiative is supported by 20 relief and humanitarian organisations.
The campaign continues tomorrow with two events taking place at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) under the supervision of the UAE Red Crescent; and the Sharjah Expo Centre under the supervision of Sharjah Charity

instagram,"In these testing times, where the world stands witness to the heart-wrenching events of the Israel-Palestine conflict, our souls ache for the innocent lives lost, and families devastated. This global catastrophe underscores the pressing necessity for compassion, empathy, and unity.

Let's be clear: nothing holds greater importance than the lives hanging in the balance in this global crisis. The terror reflected in the eyes of children, the sheer devastation of families, and the rapid toll on human lives should serve as a wake-up call. And as we stand amidst Navratri, a time of reverence and devotion, let such behavior not diminish the sanctity of the festival.

Today, on the 7th day of Navratri, as we honor Kalratri, may she cleanse us of the ego and prejudice clouding our perspectives. May she guide us to act with integrity and sincerity. Engage with the divine, pour your soul into prayers, and may her wisdom pave the way for true resolutions.

While the enthusiasm around our new release, ""Jai Ambe Jagadambe,"" is heartening, it is paramount to remember that no song or celebration should overshadow the profound suffering of those caught in the grip of this conflict. As the world grapples with this turmoil, it is our duty, both as artists and compassionate beings, to amplify the voices of the voiceless, advocating for peace and unity.

🎵 Dive into ""Jai Ambe Jagadambe,"" a song celebrating Kalratri's indomitable spirit, urging introspection and resilience. It's more than just a song; it's a testament to the transformative power of the Divine Feminine.

To be the truth when their are lies.

To know the way when there is uncertainty.

To make a path so it is easier for others.

To bring the peace when there is war.

To show the solutions when there is conflict. 

To give the words that awaken wisdom. 

It is these codings that make us brighter coaches, healers, teachers and facilitators.

It is these codes that make you strong to the core.

And these codes need to keep waking up so you can do more of your great work. 

And let me tell you they will continue to awaken until you fully arrive in the centre of your dharmic destiny.

instagram,"rp• @blackandjewishunity The dark truth about Neo Palestinian nationalism 

Let’s talk about the birth of the 
Neo Palestinians and their Nazi past 🎤 

Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a key figure in Palestinian Arab nationalism during the 20th century, sparked controversy with his association with Adolf Hitler during World War II. 🌟

🕌 Serving as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, he held influential positions in the local Arab community. Before the RE establishment of israel, he turned to Nazi Germany for support in furthering his nationalist objectives.

🤝 His friendship with Hitler is a topic of historical debate. He visited Nazi Germany, meeting high-ranking officials, including Hitler himself. His aim was to gain German assistance in opposing British and Jewish interests in the Middle East. While not formally a known as a Nazi, he sympathized with their anti-Semitic views and shared their opposition to Jewish immigration to the British mandate of Palestine.

🗣️ This association has drawn widespread criticism and continues to be a contentious subject in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Some view Al-Husseini as a collaborator with Nazi ideology, while others stress his pursuit of Palestinian nationalist goals. Nevertheless, his connection with Hitler remains a significant aspect of their dark past

instagram,"🎲1+1=? 🧩Israel’s War Is Not Just Against Hamas

October 20, 2023

Israel has been isolating the Palestinian struggle from its regional context, writes Ramzy Baroud. Palestine must, once more, become an issue that concerns all Arabs.

By Ramzy Baroud
MintPress News

At one time, the “Arab-Israeli Conflict” was Arab and Israeli. Over many years, however, it was rebranded. The media is now telling us it is a “Hamas-Israeli conflict.”

But what went wrong? Israel simply became too powerful.

The supposedly astounding Israeli victories over the years against Arab armies have emboldened Israel to the extent that it came to view itself not as a regional superpower but as a global power. Israel, per its own definition, became invincible.”

Such terminology was not a mere scare tactic aimed at breaking the spirit of Palestinians and Arabs alike. Israel believed this.

The “Israeli miracle victory” against Arab armies in 1967 was a watershed moment. Then, Israel’s Foreign Minister Abba Eban, declared in a speech at the United Nations that “from the podium of the U.N., I proclaimed the glorious triumph of the IDF and the redemption of Jerusalem.”

In his thinking, this could only mean one thing: “Never before has Israel stood more honored and revered by the nations of the world.”

The sentiment in Eban’s words echoed throughout Israel. Even those who doubted their government’s ability to prevail over the Arabs completely joined the chorus: Israel is unvanquishable.

Little rational discussion took place back then about the actual reasons why Israel had won and if that victory would have been possible without Washington’s complete backing and the West’s willingness to support Israel at any cost.

The narrator then tells the story of Joe, a young man who rebels against the rigid social norms imposed upon him by the Central Scrutinizer.

This is the Central Scrutinizer...
It is my responsibility to enforce all the laws
That haven't been passed yet
It is also my responsibility to alert each
And every one of you to the potential consequences
Of various ordinary everyday activities
You might be performing which could eventually lead to
The Death Penalty (or affect your parents' credit rating)
Our criminal institutions are full of little creeps
Like you who do wrong things...
And many of them were driven to these crimes
By a horrible force called music!
Our studies have shown that this horrible force
Is so dangerous to society at large that laws
Are being drawn up at this very moment to stop it forever!
Cruel and inhuman punishments are being carefully described
In tiny paragraphs so they won't conflict with the Constitution
(Which, itself, is being modified in order to accommodate the future)
I bring you now a special presentation
To show what can happen to you if you choose a career in music...
The white zone is for loading and unloading only...
If you have to load or unload, go to the white zone...
You'll love it... it's a way of life... Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
Hi, it's me, I'm back
This is the Central Scrutinizer...
The white zone is for loading and unloading only...
If yah gotta load, or if yah gotta unload, go to the white zone
You'll love it... it's a way of life
That's right, you'll love it, it's a way of life
That's right, you'll love it, it's a way of life
You'll love it

But whatever little conflict we have, we settle it on the court. None of us take it outside. 

That's one of the best values I think everyone gets out of sports. 

You compartmentalise and learn to create boundaries. 

I think this mindset enables you to do tasks without letting your emotions mix into your decisions.

instagram,"15 Palestinians, in new Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.

At least 15 Palestinians, including four children, were killed in renewed Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, the Gaza Interior Ministry said Saturday.

A statement said 10 were killed when Israeli fighter jets struck two houses in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.

And four children and a woman were killed in a separate strike on a house east of Rafah in southern Gaza, it said

The conflict in Gaza, under Israeli bombardment and blockade since Oct. 7, began when Hamas initiated Operation Al-Aqsa Flood -- a multi-pronged surprise attack that included a barrage of rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel by land, sea and air.

Hamas said the incursion was in retaliation for the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and growing violence by Israeli settlers.

The Israeli military then launched Operation Swords of Iron against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, putting the territory's 2.3 million residents under total siege and a blockade of food, fuel and medical supplies

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged an ""immediate humanitarian cease-fire"" to ease the ""epic human suffering.""

At least 4,137 Palestinians, including 1,524 children and 1,000 women have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza.

instagram,"Discover Maki Gallery at ASIA NOW 2023. 

@maki_gallery_tokyo specializes in the realm of post-war and contemporary Japanese art. Moreover, the gallery is deeply devoted to fostering and championing emerging talents, embracing a diverse spectrum of artists, both from Japan and abroad. 

Keisuke Tada employs acrylic paint and trompe l’oeil techniques to create hyperrealistic assemblages of wood, tiles, and chains as well as imagined Old Master paintings, each complete with signs of wear and tear. The paintings are inspired by the @vilkeisuke wanderings of the virtual plane and subvert ideas of authenticity by blurring the boundary between reality and fiction. 

Born in 1986 in Aichi, Japan, Keisuke Tada received both his BFA and MFA in oil painting from Aichi University of the Arts in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Fascinated by the sensory experiences offered by video games and other virtual worlds, Tada creates paintings that explore the blurry boundary separating reality and fiction. His trace / dimension series mimics assemblages of wooden boards, metal chains, and ceramic tiles; his Heaven’s Door series resembles antique doors that seem to have been attacked with an axe. Despite their convincing appearances, the works are crafted entirely out of paint. In Paintings of incomplete remains, the artist fabricates time by artificially aging the surface of each canvas, yielding them a likeness to classical European paintings. It could be said that Tada, who investigates the conflict between what exists and what doesn’t through his unconventional techniques, brings new dimension to the medium of painting.

The situation is really serious. Is it possible to avoid it?

This is just one of the factors that can lead to such consequences, but it should not be underestimated.

Think back to 2008, the values ​​of which we are now approaching. Oil grew and grew, until at one moment everything flew like a stone down

Now the situation is even more serious. Inflation in the United States is at an incredible 7.5%, and the rise in the price of the same oil only accelerates it

What is left for the Fed but to tighten its policy even more? Raise the key rate faster and stronger to keep inflation from climbing even higher

But such an approach will cause a strong slowdown in the economy with all the consequences

It is possible to save the situation before it is too late, but whether someone will take a step forward is not clear at the moment. One thing is for sure - the higher the oil, the greater the risk

When Hamas supporters in Tayibe found out, they went to Alaa’s store at 2 AM, looted it, and burned it to the ground. The perpetrators also tried calling Alaa during the attack to lure him to the store. Alaa isn’t sure if he’ll reopen his bicycle shop, but if he does, it won’t be in Tayibe — he’s afraid to be there now.
An Israeli-led crowdfunding effort has raised more than 650,000 NIS ($160,000) for Alaa so far.

instagram,"The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based nonprofit, has said that at least 22 journalists have been killed since the Hamas launched its massive assault on Israel on October 7.

In a report released on Friday, the CPJ said that it is investigating all reports of journalists killed, injured, detained, or missing in the raging conflict, including those hurt as hostilities spread to neighboring Lebanon.

instagram,"This months pick from our bookshop is ""On Freedom: Four Songs of Care and Constraint"" by Maggie Nelson.

""An expansive, exhilarating work of non-fiction on freedom, by the bestselling, internationally acclaimed writer. 

Drawing on a vast range of material, from critical theory to pop culture to the intimacies and plain exchanges of daily life, Maggie Nelson explores how we might think, experience, or talk about freedom in ways responsive to the conditions of our day. Her abiding interest lies in ongoing “practices of freedom” by which we negotiate our interrelation with―indeed, our inseparability from―others, with all the care and constraint that entails, while accepting difference and conflict as integral to our communion.""

instagram,"Israel is attempting to deny that it targeted the hospital, but it is not in line with their past actions. History shows that they have committed similar acts before. Additionally, there have been reports and videos of bombing more than million homes, affecting over a million people in Gaza. Tragically, thousands of children have lost their lives since October 8th, and the bombings continues all over Gaza to this day.

I encourage both Arabs and Westerners who have not studied the history of the Palestinian conflict to educate themselves before passing judgments on Palestine. The land rightfully belongs to the Palestinians, who are currently living under Israeli occupation and face daily hardships. It is crucial to understand the ongoing suffering they endure, as they feel marginalized and oppressed. They are prohibited from resisting, and if they resist the occupation, war is waged against them

The situation is dire, with the Palestinian people feeling like they are being annihilated.""

But, therapy isn’t just for someone going through a difficult time. If you have a healthy state of mind, you’re typically more open and insightful and can benefit from therapy in myriad ways. Therapy can help you to transform any negative mindsets which will have a positive impact on your life. 🌱 @zendaya

instagram,"Over the next two days, I’ll be talking about (1) how to make your partner feel safe in a relationship and (2) how to create your own safety in a relationship.
⠀⠀
You can make your partner feel safe in a relationship by putting the following tips into practice:
⠀⠀
1. Have Empathy
• Empathy is the ability to connect with your partner’s thoughts and feelings.
• The most powerful form is empathy is listening and validating.
• After a long day, ask your partner, “Is there anything you need to talk about? I’m here to listen.”
• Practice saying “I’m sorry” and ‘I apologize for hurting you” after a mistake.
⠀⠀
2. Always Give Reassurance
• Reassurance is the ability to remove your partner’s doubts about the relationship.
• No matter how secure your partner appears, he or she will have moments when they doubt your love. Therefore, reassurance is necessary.
• Ask your partner often, “How can I give you reassurance? I don’t want you to question my loyalty.”
⠀⠀
3. Practice Healthy Conflict Management
• Poor conflict management is the leading cause of feeling unsafe in a relationship.
•Does your partner feel like you’re going to leave because of a disagreement? This is not okay.
• Does your partner feel more distant than close to you after a conflict? This is not okay.
• If you want to learn healthy conflict management, schedule an appointment to work with me.
⠀⠀
4. Be Trustworthy
• Safety and trust work together.
• Trust creates safety.
• There are five trustworthy behaviors: (1) honest communication, (2) honoring boundaries, (3) reliability, (4) predicability and (5) loyalty.
⠀⠀
5. Spend Quality Time Together
• Presence is the most powerful thing in a relationship.
• Spending quality time with your partner, without being distracted, is the best way to create safety.
⠀⠀
Each of these tips will help your partner feel safe with you. I’ll talk about how to create your own safety in a relationship tomorrow. If you have any other tips, please share them in the comments below ❤️

instagram,"Making The Marriage Work
Preacher: Pastor Femi Awodele

Matthew 19:1, 1 Thessalonians 5:23, 

Two major parts of our essence are:

•Nature: what we pick from genes, hereditary traits...
•Nurture: what you learn via grooming.

Psychologically we can be placed in three traits:

•Aggressive personality trait: they explode when angry

•Passive/aggressive personality: they are not so expressive or spontaneous expression.

•Passive personality: they are  typically laid back in their expression.

Our personalities and cultures impact our marital choice.For a marriage to work, one has to align with Biblical principles.

Communication is key in resolving conflicts. Talking is different from communication. Talking could be one way, but communication is a two-way process.

Keynotes in communication:
• What you say
•Tone
•Body language.

Relevant communication skills:
•Attend
•Acknowledge
•Invite
•Summarize
•Ask; ask questions for clarification.
•Share your feelings.
•Disclose what you want, and make suggestions.

Note: use the word ""I"" more than ""you"".

How to communicate:
•Set a time!
•Do not demean your spouse by spewing negativity.
•Don't be historical! 
•Avoid defensive words like NEVER and ALWAYS
•Do not bring children into your fights!
•Always start by saying something endearing about your spouse. Psychologically, when you approach someone with endearing words, it alleviates their tension.

Steps to conflict resolution:
•Set a time!
•Separate the person from the issue. Understand the why.
•Seek Godly strategy.

Note: God created your wife to complement you.

How to maintain your marriage: 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Acts 2:42;

•Word
•Study
•Prayer
•Fellowship
•Take care of yourself! 
•Sex: it has a spiritual connotation.

The mind is what makes you make a decision, while the will is what makes you implement it or not.

Note: make up your mind on biblical principles, and submit yourself to God's will.

instagram,"***M A D E L E I N E*** “There’s joy, there’s hope, there’s conflict. There's life”

Madeleine Mantock graces Square Mile’s Digital Spotlight cover to discuss all things Hamnet, and her experience taking the lead as Agnes Hathaway in the West End show.

Per Square Mile: ‘A story told over a period of 20 years, the show has all the staples of a play written by the bard himself. There’s mystery and magic, a forbidden love story, and a tragedy all too heavy to bear. But don’t let the title fool you. Hamnet is its name, and Shakespeare walks the stage, but the spotlight falls on his wife, Agnes Hathaway. 

The woman at the edge of the forest, Agnes has the ability to look at a person and see right through to their soul. She is played by Madeleine Mantock, a woman not unfamiliar with magical roles.’
