The school year has just begun, and classrooms across the country fill up with students eager to learn. But for many families impacted by conflict, getting an education continues to be a challenge. Important civil and identity documents - such as birth certificates and national IDs - were often lost, destroyed or confiscated during displacement and many families find it logistically or financially difficult to replace them. Other families were never able to issue these documents in the first place. Because children need identity documents to enroll in school, education is further stalled. USAID and @IOMIraq are providing legal services to survivors of war that helps them access civil and identity documentation as well as compensation for the harm done. By doing so, we're helping children impacted by conflict overcome barriers to learning and access their right to return to the classroom. According to reporting by OCHA, approximately 450,000 of the IDPs and returnees missing documentation in 2021 were children. Over one million Iraqis are missing at least one core civil document, more than 500,000 lacking at least two basic civil papers, and an additional 250,000 lacking at least three or more core legal documents. #USAID #USAID_Iraq #Iraq USAID Middle East IOM Iraq",,8304,"{'like_count': 8091, 'comment_count': 89, 'num_users': 275707}",USAID Iraq,,2023-10-06 15:24:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/273706743_317753870378835_4063616581833156736_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=79QcYdtHsUcAX_KiXW9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDSEmCZX8oxy_BcqSZCiBY-42qmwV8dD94DmrbzjxFSJA&oe=655B2841,https://www.facebook.com/100064326744112/posts/709613811192837,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387165487_709610654526486_6542390582802961645_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=Hylb3CJzpg4AX8SWjl1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCdhcDZ-nXLaCQWPhAfUKLAIs8X06gPmzIY71eDWuTtfA&oe=6525760C

facebook,"In 1249 the Great Khan of the Mongols, G√ºy√ºk, decided to assert his authority in the Seljuk sultanate of Rum. He gave his choice as sultan, Kilij Arslan, two thousand Mongol horsemen, and the daughter of a Mongol general in marriage. Kilij was then sent off to destroy his elder brother, Kaykaus, who had the support of the Roman emperor, Vatatzes. This was, among other things, a war between Vatatzes and the Mongols. The Roman emperor wanted to avoid two outcomes: direct conflict with the Mongols, and being forced to become their vassal. His policy was vindicated at Aksaray (Aksaray province, Turkey) where, on 14 June 1249, Kaykaus defeated Kilij Arslan in battle. Afterwards, the Mongols agreed to divide Rum between the brothers, which reduced the threat to Nicaea. Then, after the death of G√ºy√ºk, the Mongol state collapsed into internal warfare. Thus, Vatatzes had staved off the Mongol threat. It re-emerged in 1251, when Hulagu Khan ‚Äì a grandson of Genghis ‚Äì sent an embassy to Nicaea. These embassies were usually the prelude to invasion. Vatatzes was too good a chess player to fall into such a trap: he bribed the Mongol ambassador, who agreed to become the emperor's agent. The 'terror from the East' was no match for the emperor's diplomacy.

facebook,"So, in 1248 the Empire of Nicaea and the Golden Horde were rivals for control of the Seljuk sultanate. The Roman emperor, John Vatatzes, had arranged a marriage alliance with the sultan, Kaykaus II. For their part, the Mongols chose to support Khusyraw's rival and younger brother, Kilij Arslan IV. Both the sultans were young: Kaykaus was just fourteen, his brother twelve. Although they ruled in name, actual government was handled by their chief advisers or 'wazirs'. These were powerful and influential men: Kaykaus's wazir, Shams al-Din al-Isfahani, took as his wife the sultan's Greek mother, a mysterious lady known as 'the secluded woman of Burdul'. A later tradition made her the 'sister' of the Roman emperor, Michael VIII. Despite being half-Greek, Kilij Arslan presented himself as a true Turk: his coinage depicts an archer on a prancing horse, recalling earlier Eastern Anatolian Turkish custom and Mongol styles. This was probably because Kilij Arslan relied on the support of the Mongols and the frontier Turks. The tension was acute. In early 1249, Shams al-Din suddenly fell from power and was tortured and executed. His replacement as wazir, Jalal al-Din, was a pious Muslim and a Greek by blood. The violent coup triggered conflict within the divided sultanate: within a few weeks, the factions were at war.

facebook,"TIPOLOGII UMANE Cei nascuti in zilele de 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31 ‚Äì Tipologia A1 ‚Äì Curgere si apa Dintre toate tipologiile, oamenii A1 sunt cei care au viziunea cea mai calda si mai frumoasa asupra iubirii. Pentru ei insisi, intregul lor destin se rezuma la ‚Äúa iubi‚Äù, iar daca nu reusesc acest lucru se simt nefericiti, neimpliniti, traind cu sentimentul ca nu si-au atins menirea in viata. Se indragostesc de multe ori in viata, cu prea multa usurinta am putea spune, de fiecare data ca si cand ar fi prima si ultima oara, insa dezvolta relatii sentimentale de o natura neobisnuita, adesea furtunoase si intense. Au o natura prietenoasa si adora sa traiasca in mijlocul celorlalti, inconjurati de viata, de tumult, de agitatie si de complicatii. Sunt precum apa: dinamici, plini de viata, agili, se strecoara printre stanci si oameni si in ciuda obstacolelor reusesc cumva sa iasa la suprafata. Chiar daca nu realizeaza, au capacitatea de a-i modela pe ceilalti, contribuind la evolutia lor interioara. Sunt insa si schimbatori si uneori, in ciuda unor calitati remarcabile, prea umili, modesti si sensibili la gesturile si cuvintele celor din jur. Cei nascuti in zilele de 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 ‚Äì Tipologia A2 ‚Äì Foc si visuri Oamenii A2 au visuri inalte, asteptari si cerinte de proportii cosmice de la ei insisi, iar viata lor intreaga se construieste in jurul implinirii ambitiilor si dorintelor lor secrete. S-au nascut sa se redescopere, sa se lase modelati si sa nu isi lase spiritul sa se stinga. Sunt perfectionisti innascuti si atunci cand vine vorba de ceea ce-si doresc rareori fac lucrurile pe jumatate. Oameni A2 sunt ca focul: spontani, minunati, puternici, creativi, dominanti pana la cotropire, crezand intens in propria putere, impunand respect si admiratie, dar totodata si teama. Nu multi sunt cei care le stau neconditionat in preajma fara a nu se simti folositi, manipulati, influentati chiar si la un nivel inconstient. Cu greu incredinteaza unei persoane, fie ea si prieten, increderea lor. Pot fi numiti oricum, numai naivi nu. Isi cunosc interesele si stiu sa puna in balanta atat aspectele pozitive cat si pe cele negative ale unei chestiuni. Iubirea si implinirea sentimentala ocupa un loc important in viata oamenilor A2, insa intotdeauna cautarea persoanei potrivite se aseamana prea mult cu cautarea perfectiunii. Iubirea le survine pe o cale mai anevoioasa si de multe ori constata cu tristete ca au iubit cu adevarat atunci cand relatia respectiva se afla la final. Este foarte posibil ca de-a lungul vietii sa dezvolte tendinta spre egoism, malitiozitate, insensibilitate si sa emita exigente prea mari de la partenerul de viata. Cei nascuti in zilele de 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28 ‚Äì Tipologia C3 ‚Äì Aer si libertate Oamenii C3 sunt nascuti sa fie liberi, sa-si exprime sentimentele, sa spuna deschis ceea ce gandesc, sa circule dupa bunul plac, sa calatoreasca, sa cunoasca, sa experimenteze dupa legile propriului arbitru, sa transmita mai departe cunostintele pe care le detin. De multe ori, idealurile lor de viata nu cunosc o reprezentare concreta si materiala, ci sunt simbolizate de alte persoane. Oamenii C3 sunt totodata extrem de pasionali si impulsivi si pot deveni dependenti de cei pe care ii iubesc, avand tendinta de a-i sufoca, de a-i absorbi spiritual. Chiar daca detin arta stapanirii si a controlarii emotiilor, uneori deciziile pe care le iau ii sperie pe cei din jur prin necunoscutul si controversele carora le dau nastere. Daca vrei sa te iubeasca, lasa-i liberi si nu le ingradi spiritul. Sunt facuti sa simta, sa vada, sa guste, sa se delecteze cu tot ce este mai frumos pe lumea aceasta, sa experimenteze senzatii si emotii supreme. Cu greu poti fi legati de un loc, insa daca isi gasesc aici rostul, dupa lungi peregrinari, se intorc de buna voie la ceea ce au lasat in urma. Cei nascuti in zilele de 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29 ‚Äì Tipologia D4 ‚Äì Pamant si stabilitate Oamenii D4 sunt precum pamantul -consistenti, vitali, esentiali pentru existenta celorlalti, stabili, exercitand un magnetism aparte, toleranti pana la extreme, cu o minte ascutita si patrunzatoare. Sunt oameni practici, calmi, pacifisti, echilibrati, cu un simt al judecatii si al ratiunii foarte bine dezvoltat, stapanindu-si emotiile si exteriorizandu-le doar in fata acelor persoane pe care le considera a avea o afinitate cu ei. Cred in prietenie, in stabilitatea ei si o plaseaza adesea asupra tuturor celorlalte relatii interumane. Sunt insa adesea greoi, prea cerebrali, lipsiti de spontaneitate, luand deciziile cu mintea si mai putin cu sufletul. Felul lor de a iubi este unul loial, stabilind relatii de lunga durata cu o persoana care le aduce liniste si armonie. Chiar daca vor iubi intens si se vor simti atrasi de o persoana cu o personalitate opusa lor, vor avea tendinta de a se retrage la primul semn de conflict sau neintelegere. Foarte probabil ca se vor sustrage dintr-o relatie prea pasionala sub pretextul ca nu este ceea ce isi doresc de la viata.

facebook,"One of the biggest struggles when you‚Äôre being narcissistically abused‚Ä¶ Is that you don‚Äôt KNOW you‚Äôre being narcissistically abused. And the confusion is actually part of the abuse. But because you don‚Äôt yet realize what‚Äôs happening, you think it‚Äôs a: Communication issue. Difference of opinion. Personality conflict. You‚Äôre looking for a rational explanation to an irrational situation. You‚Äôre looking for the cause or source, thinking that if you can figure out ‚Äúwhy‚Äù it‚Äôs happening then you can figure out ‚Äúwhat‚Äù it is and ‚Äúhow‚Äù to solve it. And the search for ‚Äúwhy‚Äù can keep you cycling for a VERY long time. Because there‚Äôs no small amount of information about relationships these days. You can easily go down a rabbit hole about: Love languages. Attachment styles. Communication strategies. Astrological signs. All in a desperate attempt to ‚Äúfigure it out.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ Toxic is toxic no matter what attachment style you have. Abuse is abuse no matter what your love language is. Don‚Äôt get so distracted with all the relationship advice that you normalize toxic behaviors. If you‚Äôve been stuck ruminating, trying to figure out what‚Äôs causing your relationship struggles‚Ä¶ Stop searching. And start observing. What patterns do you see? How do you feel around this person? Are they being kind and respectful? Do they acknowledge your reality? Do you have to justify how you feel? Can you agree to disagree? You have to step OUT of the chaos to make sense of it. And if you‚Äôd like some help making sense of what you observe, my new book was written with you in mind!

facebook,"If you want a fake relationship, avoid conflict. If you want a real relationship, learn to fight wise. By which I just mean learn how to honor BOTH your own experience AND your partner‚Äôs ... at the same time.

facebook,"HAPPY FEAST OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARYüôèüéâüéäüôè BACKGROUND This feast was established by Pope Pius V to commemorate the great victory of the Christian army against the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. All soldiers on the battlefield prayed the Rosary for three hours and the wind has shifted in their favor. They were able to defeat an army three times bigger, in one of the greatest naval victory in history. Pope Pius V named this the Feast of Our Lady of Victories, to be celebrated on October 7th. In 1573, Pope Gregory XIII changed the title of this memorial to Feast of the Holy Rosary. Pope Paul VI established the form that we celebrate this feast today, in 1969 under the name ‚ÄúOur Lady of the Rosary‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe celebration of this day invites all to mediate upon the mysteries of Christ, following the example of the Blessed Virgin Mary who was so singularly associated with the incarnation, passion and glorious resurrection of the Son of God.‚Äù Fragment from the Christian Prayer (Liturgy of the Hours) Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, praying for the conversion of sinners often said, ‚ÄúLove the Madonna and pray the rosary, for her rosary is the weapon against the evils of the world today.‚Äù PRAYER Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, in these times of such brazen impiety, show your power with the signs of your former victories. Look with mercy on the Church of your Son, on His Vicar on earth, and on all the clergy and laity, who are sorely oppressed in this mighty conflict. Powerful vanquisher of all heresies, hasten the hour of mercy even though the hour of God‚Äôs justice is every day provoked by the countless sins of men. As I kneel before you in prayer, obtain for me my requests (Mention your request here‚Ä¶) Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, pray for us.",,1032,"{'like_count': 359, 'comment_count': 321, 'num_users': 637778}",üíû Jesus & Mary and all the saint's üíû,,2023-10-06 23:59:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/399822754_716321090562839_8739426909959840239_n.jpg?stp=c2.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ASullMrNdoUAX_IwHTA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBPsXQWwlxVvTdCdgvYOQzoDp7qispOY6iscLuUzZk6Fg&oe=655A250F,https://www.facebook.com/groups/326633581168582/permalink/2219067978591790,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387191083_10226026781029197_6852122353926736993_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=aTW11PJwgwQAX9xX_Mg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDX5VBK22yPMwqkttHqyg6k90ybSK9Mgt7y1pGSHFXc6Q&oe=65251968

Peace is more than the mercurial, vaporous, whimsical wish of folks who want everyone to get along and things to be calm. The peace the apostle Paul describes is true peace with God. This peace goes much deeper than simply our desire for calmness and a lack of conflict. Jesus, through his sacrificial obedience to God, has made peace with God real for us. Yes, God provided it by grace. Yes, God is the one who ensures it because of that grace. But, because this peace is tied to him and his character, we can rejoice and anticipate being caught up in the glory of our majestic and holy God in whom we have eternal peace. My Prayer... O majestic and holy God on high, I praise you for the gift of your grace in Jesus.

facebook,"*FRIDAY, 6 OCTOBER 2023* *TEXT: PROVERBS 10: 1 - 17* *TOPIC: THE CLUSTER OF WISDOM* *PROVERBS 10: 1 - 17 NIV* 1:The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son brings grief to his mother. 2:Ill-gotten treasures have no lasting value, but righteousness delivers from death. 3:The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked. 4:Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth. 5:He who gathers crops in summer is a prudent son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son. 6:Blessings crown the head of the righteous, but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked. 7:The name of the righteous is used in blessings, but the name of the wicked will rot. 8:The wise in heart accept commands, but a chattering fool comes to ruin. 9:Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out. 10:Whoever winks maliciously causes grief, and a chattering fool comes to ruin. 11:The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12:Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs. 13:Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense. 14:The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool invites ruin. 15:The wealth of the rich is their fortified city, but poverty is the ruin of the poor. 16:The wages of the righteous is life, but the earnings of the wicked are sin and death. 17:Whoever heeds discipline shows the way to life, but whoever ignores correction leads others astray. *THE CLUSTER OF WISDOM* Today's text gives us an idea about how to deal with wealth and poverty and points out that wealth acquired by unrighteous means has no value but wealth gotten through righteous means is far more valuable. The wisdom here is that diligence under God's guidance is the secret of acquiring wealth but a lazy person is a disgrace and is heading towards poverty (vs.4-5). In fact, verses 15-17 confirm that riches fortify the city for the righteous but verses 6 and 7 show that the wise man shows the contrast between the life of a righteous person and the wicked. While blessings will be the portion of the righteous, violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked and even their names will rot (vs.7).

When people live far from scenes of the Great Spirit's making, it's easy for them to forget His laws."" -- Tatanga Mani (Walking Buffalo), STONEY Nature is life's greatest teacher. The natural laws are hidden in nature. Hidden are solutions to everyday problems such as; conflict resolution, how to forgive, lessons about differences, how to manage organizations, how to think. Hidden are feelings. You can look at something and you will feel it. At night, have you ever looked at the sky when there are no clouds? As you look at all the stars, your heart will become very joyful. You will walk away feeling joyful and peaceful. We need to visit nature so we can see and feel these things.

facebook,"Forever and a day ; A thousand years ago Moonbeams streaked down through the jungle trees of Vietnam like silver tracer rounds. As we lay there upon the muddy red damp ground in the darkness, they were a welcome sight. Our Eyes searched and rode the moonbeams upward towards the freedom of the heavens. In them we escaped the hellish moments where time stood still. Vietnam at its best was a time of heartache and a time of loneliness and misery. We who fought this war were mostly teenagers still wet behind the ears. The majority of us were fresh out of boot camp that got tangled up in an unwanted and unpopular conflict. There were rare moments in the Nam when we had the time to think about a different place and time. Times when the moonlight shimmered in the perfumed hair of our high school sweethearts and we could for a moment return back to a time when the passion of youth ruled our hearts. There was a time when Vietnam was just a distant land that did not compete for our lives or our thoughts. But now as we lay in wait for our enemy upon a bloodied foreign soil thousands of miles away, home was a bittersweet memory. Nothing more than a surrealistic dream where we once cruised the familiar streets in our parents‚Äô car and listened for that special song on the radio that would become ""our song"". Oh sure, there was always the inevitable newscast filled with static that told of a distant war being fought in a place called Vietnam. Yet the news seemed so unreal and so far away, that what was going on ‚Äúover there‚Äù didn‚Äôt matter. A simple turn of the radio knob, a mere flick of the wrist would end the grim reapers‚Äô tale and music would fill the air. The innocence of our time was replaced with turbulence of a divided nation. The corruptness of an unwanted war and the unrest of the sixties stole the youth of those of us who believed in and enjoyed our freedom. We who held our own freedom sacred and with honor went off to fight for, and protect that same God given right in a foreign country; just as our fathers did before us. This once distant place became a time of times for many of us and the Vietnam Conflict became the end of time for the warriors who fought and died in an unpopular country that would become infamously known as, Vietnam.

facebook,"The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) views the decision by the Anglican Church of Southern Africa to label Israel an ‚ÄòApartheid State‚Äô as shocking, shortsighted, and disappointing. ACDP leader Rev Kenneth Meshoe said, ‚ÄúArchbishop Thabo Mokgoba knows that the Church is given a ministry of reconciliation, and thus, to be a credible facilitator of reconciliation, one has to be objective and not take sides with any of the parties in conflict. The Archbishop expressed his concern for Palestinians but does not express similar concerns for many Israeli victims of terror attacks at the hands of Palestinian terror groups. ‚ÄúThe Archbishop has, in my opinion, discredited and jeopardised his chances of being a credible mediator in the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict by taking sides with one against the other. ‚ÄúExcept for security concerns, there is no place in Israel that Palestinians are not allowed to access as it happened in apartheid South Africa. There are no amenities or buildings, schools or universities that are designated for Jewish use only as it happened in South Africa during apartheid. ‚ÄúLabelling Israel an ‚ÄòApartheid State‚Äô is inaccurate, malicious, and will not help to promote peace and harmony in the Middle East. Its only purpose is to demonise Israel and to isolate her to delegitimise Israel‚Äôs existence. ‚ÄúThe unfortunate decision taken by the Anglican Church of Southern Africa to label Israel an ‚ÄòApartheid State‚Äô betrays the memory of those who suffered through the real apartheid of South Africa. Having visited Israel on several occasions, I know that nothing happening in that country, that I have seen or read, can be compared to apartheid in South Africa. ‚ÄúThose who say what is happening in Israel is like apartheid South Africa are trivialising the suffering that black South Africans suffered. They are taking the sting out of the pain that we suffered under apartheid. If South African apartheid was like what people are seeing in Israel, then there would never have been any need for Nelson Mandela and others to go to prison because they would have had all the rights Arabs in Israel are enjoying today such as the right to vote and the right to choose, and freedom of movement. ‚ÄúThere are judges in Israeli courts who are not Jewish, and yet are allowed by law to preside over cases involving Jewish suspects. In apartheid South Africa, that was not allowed. You have Arab teachers in Israel who are teaching Jewish children. In apartheid South Africa, black teachers could never teach white children. This was real apartheid in South Africa where even separate amenities were enforced. ‚ÄúThe charge that Israel is an ‚ÄòApartheid State‚Äô is a lie about the real Israel, and it is a lie about the real apartheid that South Africa observed and practised.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe regrettable decision by the Anglican Church of Southern Africa to label Israel an ‚ÄòApartheid State‚Äô will never be supported by the ACDP as it is based on a lie, political correctness, and hatred for the only democratic Jewish State in the Middle East,‚Äù Meshoe said.",,687,"{'like_count': 251, 'comment_count': 353, 'num_users': 47793}",ACDP,,2023-10-06 12:25:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271716967_476938510464623_5249725860407545049_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7REMxOPtfekAX_pUe9R&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCwJJ4o6_EIi0OD5mwELN0osrpx8cEwhD_CT7kefvK1rA&oe=655A4AC1,https://www.facebook.com/100044454338734/posts/875932073898596,

She feels the need to show Sarab that she's always there for his family. Harleen recalls a conversation with Sarab, where she expresses her frustration with his changing behavior. Dolly reassures Sarab of Harleen's love and pleads with him not to let their family break apart. Meher asks the cook what to prepare for dinner, but Harleen confronts her and demands that she choose between her brother and her unborn child. Harleen accuses Meher of breaking her trust and tries to give back jewelry and money, but Meher insists she won't take them back unless she regains Harleen's trust. Sarab is torn between his sister and wife, questioning the impact of his decision on their sibling relationship. Harleen decides to leave the house, and Sarab offers to leave instead, but Dolly intervenes, urging them to talk and find a solution. Harleen suggests dividing everything between them, causing shock and tension among the family members. Sarab agrees to divide their assets to keep his sister happy, even though Meher pleads with Harleen not to break their family. Kulwant discusses the possibility of dividing their assets among her children, while Sarab, Harleen, and Meher are still in conflict. Rovi informs Sarab that the auction papers are ready, and Harleen prepares for the division, while Meher resigns herself to the situation.

facebook,"@everyone *COMMENTS REGARDING CHARACTERS AND CAST MEMBERS* Some comments recently on a few posts have been bordering on hate which is something we dont want to see in the group. Saying you dislike a character is ok, but some of the comments lately have been awful. ü´£ We all have varied opinions on different characters which is great and makes great discussion, but unfortunately a few people have taken this to a level of hate. As the admin of this group, i would like to ask that any further comments that have dislike towards a character be kept sensible and polite please. None of the new characters have been on screen long enough to be able to be judged fully. The rodwells are a prime example of that. There were hardly on screen before the rested period, and have only started becoming more involved recently. Please remember what you see on screen are characters, and the cast members behind them are acting how they are told to act to bring that character to life. In the case of new characters, they have had such little onscreen time so far, you can not judge the cast member on their abilitys until you have got to know the character they are playing. Every cast member currently in neighbours are very talented or Jason Herbison would not of picked them for the role. Remember 1 thing when judging - Your comments can make or break a cast members career. An actor is picked to match the character not the other way round so if you find a character annoying it's because that character has been written to be annoying on purpose. Also shows especially soaps need the characters to resemble real people for them to be successful, This means just like real life you need to represent people with all different personalities, to create a community that feels like real life and not fiction. For those who went to the meet and greets on the celebration tour, and had the honour of meeting some of their favourite cast members, that was perfect example of how different the actor is compared to their characters and how we know them on screen. *Please remember this when judging a character and cast member* *Word's such, as bimbo, nonce, dipstick, retarded are forms of hate speech, so please refrain from using them* If you are not a fan of Neighbours then don't join the group, as you're purpose is only to cause conflict between group members. ü´£ Healthy discussions are important, but please respect everyone's opinions and views.

facebook,"I do my best to be sensitive in the language I use, not wanting to drive people away from a life-giving message because of controversial terminology. Yet there are times when being blunt is essential, and now is one of those times. That is why Pastor Andy Stanley must be called out publicly for inviting practicing homosexuals to speak at his Unconditional Conference. The fact that these men claim to be committed Christians makes the sin all the more grievous. I‚Äôm speaking specifically of Justin Lee and Brian Nietzel, both of whom are not only openly ‚Äúgay Christians‚Äù but are also ‚Äúmarried‚Äù to their same-sex partners. This means that, according to the plain teaching of Scripture, they will not inherit the kingdom of God (see 1 Corinthians 6:9-10) and their actions are detestable in His sight (Leviticus 18:22). Justin and Brian might be very gracious and kind men. Their partners might be terrific people in many ways. They might even model certain aspects of Christian compassion and grace and profess some orthodox beliefs. But that only magnifies the level of deception involved, since Satan himself comes as an angel of light (see 2 Corinthians 11:13-15). It is true that, on the Sunday following the Unconditional Conference Pastor Stanley reaffirmed that biblical marriage is the union of a man and a woman and claimed that his church did not condone sin, although he made other statements that muddied the water and caused confusion. But he also stated that both Justin and Brian have spoken to his people before, with his blessing and approval. This means that on several occasions, he has willfully exposed his flock to their message and example, thereby undermining the positive statements he made in his sermon. This is as destructive as it is confusing. Pastor Stanley, with whom I‚Äôve been in friendly correspondence and interaction since 2015, pressing him for clarity on these issues, emphasized that the purpose of the conference was not to debate theology. Rather, it was to help parents understand how they should deal with their kids who identify as LGBTQ+. He didn‚Äôt want this generation of Christians to perpetuate the errors of past generations, where parents often rejected their kids or tried to strong-arm them into becoming straight. It was time, he said, for this to stop. The church must do better. On this we agree, point for point. We need to do better. We need to show unconditional love. We need to recognize how deep these struggles can be. And we need to understand the degree to which Christian young people, in particular, can suffer an acute conflict over these feelings, which they did not ask for. Yes, let us be educated and let us love well. But under no circumstances should we affirm a child‚Äôs gay or bi or trans or queer identity. Even more emphatically, under no circumstances should we tell them that they can follow Jesus and be in a same-sex, sexual or romantic relationship. God forbid. To do so is to be complicit in their demise. In a statement to The Roys Report, Justin Lee claimed that he didn‚Äôt ‚Äútake any position on topics like same-sex marriage or sexual behavior‚Äù at the conference. Instead, he stated, ‚ÄúMy primary message was that Christians should look to Jesus and to Scripture‚Äînot to me or any human source‚Äîfor determining what is God‚Äôs will. And that Christians who follow Jesus‚Äôs example can treat others with love and empathy without compromising on truth.‚Äù But what about his personal example? What about the example of Brian? What about their online resources and teachings? To paraphrase, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not taking a public position here on same-sex marriage or sexual behavior. But in my personal example, in which I am in a same-sex marriage and have sex with my male partner, I‚Äôm shouting quite loudly to all of you.‚Äù The very presence of Justin and Brian at the conference, along with men like Christian ethicist David Gushee, who believes that God affirms committed, same-sex relationships, sent a clear message to all those in attendance. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù they were saying, ‚Äúyour kids can practice homosexuality and follow Jesus at the same time.‚Äù And these men were not just given a platform but were honored and celebrated for who they are. Otherwise, they would not have been invited to speak. Consider that it was Justin who founded the ‚ÄúGay Christian Network,‚Äù with most of the adherents in the network affirming same-sex, ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù relationships. And Justin‚Äôs new organization, called Nuance Ministries, recommends groups like the Reformation Project, which actively seeks to change church views on the Bible and homosexual practice. (See https://gaychristian.net/,:=:https://gaychristian.net/ one of the Nuance Ministries links; while still under construction, the site links to the Reformation Project and others of like mind.) As for Brian, his bio states that he ‚Äúis a gay man committed to his faith and love for Jesus. He grew up in the Evangelical Church and struggled with his sexuality, then later in life found his peace with God.

""Lots of people hardly ever feel real soil under their feet, see plants grow except in flower pots, or get far enough beyond the street light to catch the enchantment of a night sky studded with stars. When people live far from scenes of the Great Spirit's making, it's easy for them to forget His laws."" 
--Tatanga Mani (Walking Buffalo), STONEY

Nature is life's greatest teacher. The natural laws are hidden in nature. Hidden are solutions to everyday problems such as; conflict resolution, how to forgive, lessons about differences, how to manage organizations, how to think. Hidden are feelings. You can look at something and you will feel it. At night, have you ever looked at the sky when there are no clouds? As you look at all the stars, your heart will become very joyful. You will walk away feeling joyful and peaceful. We need to visit nature so we can see and feel these things.

facebook,"One sign of maturity is self control. During conflict, managing your anger and controlling your mouth is great wisdom. Don't run your mouth like a tap saying stupid things to your spouse and thereafter say you didn't actually mean this. Some will even say ""you know I have anger issues"". Right from courtship they destroy their future home and marriage with their mouth. There is life in words. Stop cursing your spouse out of anger and stop abusive words. Learn a better way to manage your conflicts. True! You may apologize but some things are better not said. He or she may forgive but it may be so difficult to forget.

facebook,"NATIVE AMERICANS ‚Äì THE FIRST OWNERS OF AMERICA Native Americans, or the indigenous peoples of the Americas, are the pre-Columbian inhabitants of North and South America and their descendants. Those who live within the boundaries of the present-day United States are composed of numerous, distinct tribes, bands and ethnic groups, many of which survive as intact, sovereign nations. Most authorities agree that the first evidence of people inhabiting North America indicates that they migrated here from Eurasia over 13,000 years ago, most likely crossing along the Bering Land Bridge, which was in existence during the Ice Age. However, some historians believe that people had migrated into the Americas much earlier, up to 40,000 years ago. These early Paleo-Indians spread throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes. Application of the term ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. However, there is considerable evidence in support of successful explorations which led to Norse settlement of Greenland, the L‚ÄôAnse aux Meadows settlement in Newfoundland, and potentially others some 500 years prior to Columbus landing in the Bahamas. From the Native American aspect, many tribes‚Äô oral histories indicate they have been living here since their genesis, as described by a wide range of creation myths. By the time European adventurers arrived in the 15th century, scholars estimate that more than 50 million people were already living in the Americas. Of these, some 10 million lived in the region that would later become the United States. As time passed, these migrants and their descendants pushed south and east, adapting as they went. With these new arrivals came centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies. Today, Native Americans account for about 1.5 percent of the United States population, many of whom continue to take pride in their ancestral traditions ‚Äî still practicing the music, art, and ceremonies that took place many years ago.",,419,"{'like_count': 267, 'comment_count': 24, 'num_users': 43192}",Native American Lovers,,2023-10-06 10:21:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/370519709_272583928897962_9109481318509027194_n.jpg?stp=c0.5.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=48he6x0V4ioAX-_xKKL&_nc_oc=AQmlUpZbCq9QYmBu3r9pPWgGJcZngP__qkU1IAs1rCPwHg20XcZM5QZbwUlTvdJ9-yY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfChX-WqZRcKt8KW25orb7IiZhzBeqo0yNVv0CLK4AiGRg&oe=655B5CC1,https://www.facebook.com/100084390703928/posts/295739573249064,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/383834089_289564223866599_6675180957535248653_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=FyL52thxbL4AX_JmZG5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCNHC1UvvhSDgYu126UfzFKkmfQsEDwhViHq-ocf_LDTw&oe=6525500D

Negotiation skills: Negotiate and resolve conflict https://lnkd.in/dh95SwMM 4. Leadership and Negotiation Skills Specialization https://lnkd.in/epZmpfSx Here are some key aspects of negotiations: üëâPreparation: Before entering negotiations, it's crucial to research the subject matter, understand your goals and priorities, and anticipate the other party's interests and potential objections. This preparation helps you come to the table well-informed and confident. üëâOpening: Start the negotiation with a polite and constructive tone. Express your interest in finding a mutually beneficial solution and set the stage for productive discussions. üëâInformation Exchange: Both parties should share relevant information and perspectives to gain a better understanding of each other's needs and constraints. üëâOffer and Counteroffer: Negotiations often involve a series of offers and counteroffers. Each party presents its proposal, and the other party responds with adjustments or alternatives. üëâCompromise: Negotiation typically requires concessions from both sides. Be prepared to make compromises while staying focused on your primary objectives. üëâBATNA: Understanding your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) is essential. It's the fallback option you have if negotiations fail, and it helps you set your limits and make informed decisions. üëâZOPA: The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA) is the range within which a mutually acceptable deal can be reached. Identifying and expanding the ZOPA is a key negotiation goal. üëâEmotional Intelligence: Effective negotiators are skilled at managing emotions, both their own and those of the other party. Staying calm and composed can lead to better outcomes. üëâActive Listening: Pay close attention to what the other party is saying. Active listening helps you understand their perspective and build rapport. üëâProblem-Solving: Negotiation is not just about haggling over positions but finding creative solutions to shared problems. Brainstorming and thinking outside the box can lead to breakthroughs. üëâClosure: When an agreement is reached, document it in writing and clarify the next steps and responsibilities of each party. üëâPost-Negotiation Evaluation: After the negotiation, take time to assess what worked well and what could be improved for future negotiations. #communication #leadership #management #projectmanagement",,404,"{'like_count': 287, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 646690}",Leadership and Management,,2023-10-06 13:23:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/20842204_10155460910016259_8458342232940246399_n.jpg?stp=c8.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=wZ0ytZyhsSsAX_9ZASJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAK84B7-oEeEFhCfc78vHpmf0UfcBCMpixeAFWK5yr0SQ&oe=657D3DED,https://www.facebook.com/groups/112771712229961/permalink/2227064830800628,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386355241_880346743511756_8992429326186747054_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=PjUlYwcFDWAAX9AGECz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAUoquZYba23MCwnDi7h025V7v-fO3Xuhtoz8hC25ByVA&oe=652542A7

In contrast to addressing these deficiencies away from the necessary data to build any proposal, the discussion neglects the major deficiencies that hinder the proper implementation of any valid and suitable law. Among these major deficiencies is the absence of a democratic system based on partnership and true consultation (Shura) with various societal forces. A system that binds responsibility to accountability and relies on national competences rather than loyalties ; a system that is immune to corruption, and where a specific group does not monopolize the nation's wealth, while millions of Moroccan families live in deprivation and social fragility, which affects their material and social conditions, as well as their children's education and access to various health and welfare services. Another major deficiency is the reduction of the issue of woman, family, and children to the legal framework of the family code and the disregard of the State‚Äôs responsibility for the major difficulties endured by these groups, leading to complex problems within families. Also, one of the major deficiencies is the absence of an education system that instills in the learners, males and females, the morals and values which would qualify them to build families characterized by compassion, love and cohesion, while rejecting violence, narcissism and discord. Another major deficiency is the unfair implementation of the code articles, either in their current form or any other form. This is due to the major defects in the judiciary, in general. The endeavor to ‚Äúreform‚Äù the family code must not be separated from tackling the above-mentioned deficiencies, among others. Notwithstanding the sanctity of the family, it is just one element in the political, social, economic, educational, and cultural sphere. What makes matters gloomier is that some parties that were tasked to lead the current reform are known for their impartiality and their hostile ideological attitudes, all that at the expense of the righteous and truthful religious scholars ‚ÄòUlama‚Äò who must have the ultimate say on the issue. We are talking about the central role of the scholars as we consider the adherence to Islamic frame reference as the basis that provides us with clear vision and sound judgement. The Islamic teaching is not only a basis for bringing Muslims from closer together and fostering understanding among them but also represents the common denominator, the founding principle, and the recognized authority that we cannot imagine any public discussion about amending the family code outside its scope. Islam is the religion of the Moroccan people, they embraced, imprinted on their souls, interwoven with their history, civilization, and culture. Islam has defined their identity and maintained their unity and has never been a source of conflict or division. The Islamic frame reference is, thus, not limited to the laws, rather it is a project of renaissance and progress, a commitment to human rights, the rights of the people and the Muslim community, for both women and men equally, without discrimination in rights and responsibilities, except for what God has specified for each of them in terms of rulings and matters that correspond to the nature of their obligations and purposes. We, thereby, emphasize the supreme authority of the Islamic frame of reference, and we reject any proposition that contradicts it, while the jurisprudence (Ijtihad) from within Islam provides a platform for addressing any complicated issues, and we will never accept any compromise on clear-cut rulings in the Islamic Shari‚Äôa. We advocate for responsible jurisprudence (ijtihad) because as it is easy to stray from the fundamentals of religion by resorting to exceptional interpretations from any school of thought, ultimately placing oneself outside the framework of any valid jurisprudential ruling. Historically, one of the grave errors committed against this great religion in many cases has been the distortions of religious jurisprudence resulting in rulings that neither fall within the realm of religious law nor provide satisfactory answers to what is required. On this occasion, we address the ‚ÄòUlama to remind them of their great responsibility to speak the truth without fear of blame, especially when it concerns attempts to tamper with what remains sacred of the Sharia of the Seal of (truncated)",,361,"{'like_count': 266, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 69879}",ÿ¨ŸÖÿßÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿØŸÑ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿßŸÜ - ÿßŸÑÿµŸÅÿ≠ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸÖŸäÿ©,,2023-10-06 16:30:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292687694_1242158149865712_8422463076779886767_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3oFO3v3QIKcAX-OhKho&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCj-RFjmT4jUE3VUEtJ1TawrF1_LuZZThUiXR74yeCcSA&oe=6559E7C6,https://www.facebook.com/100050239340237/posts/864274395257197,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/383952125_864256418592328_2588583429215693439_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=y86tEZ4nOTYAX_WLEG2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDUE4VzJQLqt2_p7X0wqYffz5CgBwzk4jobKcAWaEvyvA&oe=65279848

facebook,"Late Governor Carlos M. Padilla Honored By Three Local Councils for Outstanding Public Service The late Governor Carlos M. Padilla, widely known as the ‚ÄúLegend of the North,‚Äù was recently recognized for his exceptional public service by the three local councils of Nueva Vizcaya. The Provincial Peace and Order Council (PPOC), the Provincial Anti-Drug Abuse Council (PADAC), and the Provincial Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (PTF-ELCAC) passed Resolution No. 1, Series of 2023, in his honor. In the resolution, the councils described Governor Padilla as an exemplar public official and a distinguished veteran in public service. His strategic actions, programs, projects, and activities aimed at promoting, improving, and enhancing peace and order, and public safety in the province were particularly highlighted. Governor Padilla, during his tenure, proposed and supported various programs that led to the declaration of Nueva Vizcaya as a drug-free and insurgency-free province. He also spearheaded initiatives to end local armed conflict, demonstrating his unwavering dedication to public service. The resolution further states, ‚ÄúGovernor Padilla‚Äôs exceptional leadership skills and his enormous contributions to the nation in the maintenance of peace and order, and public safety in the province are a testament to his dedication and commitment. According to Gov. Atty . Jose V. Gambito who succeeded the late governor and now the chair of the three local councils,he is committed to continuing the late Governor‚Äôs initiatives and programs, ensuring that his vision for a peaceful, safe, and progressive Nueva Vizcaya lives on. The PPOC-PADAC-PTF-ELCAC will continue to strive for a drug-free and insurgency-free province, upholding the standards set by Governor Padilla. Governor Gambito additionally remarked , ‚ÄúThe people of Nueva Vizcaya will always remember Governor Padilla as a stalwart of public safety and peace, and his influence will continue to shape the province for years to come. His unwavering dedication to public service, exceptional leadership skills, and enormous contributions to the nation will always be remembered and cherished‚Äù. Governor Padilla sadly passed away due to myocardial infarction on May 5,2023 after dedicating over 30 years of his life to public service as a mayor of Dupax del Norte ,congressman, and governor of Nueva Vizcaya.#RMI",,335,"{'like_count': 171, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 11489}",Ruth Ra√±a Padilla,,2023-10-06 10:21:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/324628496_497158102560408_1877106615290137041_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=qniHXnQ_r0QAX8jkWF4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCpuwn0mYFxJnnhjvKmcf_i9NZwKrrP_uzFWbqiq4aJYg&oe=655A4EC2,https://www.facebook.com/100063588106390/posts/818223883640541,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385094384_818223963640533_1642068203846807271_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=-rbD0KM2EsUAX8UO9vW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfATTAoAl--g15zVBn9Jyb-oNVdqcPxuQQbWqDa5PfEPmg&oe=6524FEC7

Also, one of the major deficiencies is the absence of an education system that instills in the learners, males and females, the morals and values which would qualify them to build families characterized by compassion, love and cohesion, while rejecting violence, narcissism and discord. Another major deficiency is the unfair implementation of the code articles, either in their current form or any other form. This is due to the major defects in the judiciary, in general. The endeavor to ‚Äúreform‚Äù the family code must not be separated from tackling the above-mentioned deficiencies, among others. Notwithstanding the sanctity of the family, it is just one element in the political, social, economic, educational, and cultural sphere. What makes matters gloomier is that some parties that were tasked to lead the current reform are known for their impartiality and their hostile ideological attitudes, all that at the expense of the righteous and truthful religious scholars ‚ÄòUlama‚Äò who must have the ultimate say on the issue. We are talking about the central role of the scholars as we consider the adherence to Islamic frame reference as the basis that provides us with clear vision and sound judgement. The Islamic teaching is not only a basis for bringing Muslims from closer together and fostering understanding among them but also represents the common denominator, the founding principle, and the recognized authority that we cannot imagine any public discussion about amending the family code outside its scope. Islam is the religion of the Moroccan people, they embraced, imprinted on their souls, interwoven with their history, civilization, and culture. Islam has defined their identity and maintained their unity and has never been a source of conflict or division. The Islamic frame reference is, thus, not limited to the laws, rather it is a project of renaissance and progress, a commitment to human rights, the rights of the people and the Muslim community, for both women and men equally, without discrimination in rights and responsibilities, except for what God has specified for each of them in terms of rulings and matters that correspond to the nature of their obligations and purposes. We, thereby, emphasize the supreme authority of the Islamic frame of reference, and we reject any proposition that contradicts it, while the jurisprudence (Ijtihad) from within Islam provides a platform for addressing any complicated issues, and we will never accept any compromise on clear-cut rulings in the Islamic Shari‚Äôa. We advocate for responsible jurisprudence (ijtihad) because as it is easy to stray from the fundamentals of religion by resorting to exceptional interpretations from any school of thought, ultimately placing oneself outside the framework of any valid jurisprudential ruling. Historically, one of the grave errors committed against this great religion in many cases has been the distortions of religious jurisprudence resulting in rulings that neither fall within the realm of religious law nor provide satisfactory answers to what is required. On this occasion, we address the ‚ÄòUlama to remind them of their great responsibility to speak the truth without fear of blame, especially when it concerns attempts to tamper with what remains sacred of the Sharia of the Seal of (truncated)",,331,"{'like_count': 235, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 16464}",ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ≠ŸÖÿØÿßŸàŸä,,2023-10-06 16:53:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/347576477_915424696356722_5966086597613322807_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y1tGIDzYp0cAX-cJdDc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBdtoy_a5qPCclamvz4CwJjMyV4REp8cd3-oancd6Pv6g&oe=655B53AB,https://www.facebook.com/100065308367658/posts/698068205713452,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386584333_698068175713455_8245287507497238192_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=oOBPnaWKvk4AX-Watq6&_nc_oc=AQn2FG7CSrdbkK1gQJhkIOqk4Qu9ImpUuMGMSMez8qDJog8HHcpKJM15l23ychZwekY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBePB66b4aJOj5aC3Z3y7s43ZWSVI5ZsFgqb09yXXUF9g&oe=65287ED0

Philippine National Police Chief, Police General Benjamin C. Acorda Jr., led the send-off ceremony for 25 police officers who are set to be deployed to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). The event, which took place on October 2, 2023, was attended by dignitaries and officials, including Secretary Antonio Ernesto F. Lagdameo Jr., the Special Assistant to the President.

In his send-off message to the PNP contingent, PGen. Acorda emphasized the significance of the Philippines‚Äô unwavering commitment to international peacekeeping efforts. He stated, ‚ÄúIn line with our noble peacekeeping missions aimed at promoting global peace and security, we gather here today to bid farewell to 25 courageous officers who will be deployed to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).‚Äù

The Philippines has a long-standing tradition of contributing to UN peacekeeping missions. Over the years, Filipino police officers have consistently served with honor and distinction in various UN operations worldwide, often in challenging conflict zones, where they risk their lives to protect vulnerable communities and uphold the principles of the United Nations.

‚ÄúTo the 25 members of the PNP contingent who are embarking on this mission, you are about to represent the PNP, our nation, and our people on an international stage,‚Äù PGen. Acorda emphasized. ‚ÄúYour journey will be arduous, filled with both triumphs and trials, but I have absolute confidence that you will carry our flag with unwavering pride and unwavering integrity.‚Äù

As these officers prepare to venture forth to South Sudan, the PNP Chief encouraged them to serve with honor, courage, and unwavering dedication. He urged them to return home safely, knowing that their country is immensely proud of their service.

During the ceremony, Secretary Antonio Ernesto F. Lagdameo Jr., the Special Assistant to the President, also addressed the contingent, emphasizing the significance of their mission and the trust that the nation places in their hands. His heartfelt insights and words of encouragement were a profound source of inspiration for the officers as they prepared to face the challenges ahead.

In conclusion, PGen. Acorda extended his heartfelt best wishes to the 25 PNP contingent members, acknowledging the sacrifices they are making by leaving behind the comforts of home, the warmth of their families, and the familiar streets of their nation. He praised their willingness to venture into an environment fraught with uncertainty and danger, commending them for their selflessness and profound sense of duty to uphold the ideals of the United Nations.

‚ÄúMabuhay kayong lahat! May your journey be safe, your mission successful, and your hearts filled with the pride of serving humanity,‚Äù he concluded.

As these dedicated officers embark on their mission in South Sudan, the Philippines stands united in wholeheartedly supporting their noble efforts to promote peace and security on the global stage.

facebook,"Killing as a means of surviving, @T&T HARD CORE News More money for Carnival than for the Communities. The reason for murders, is well known and has been well documented over the years. Lack of food, water, shelter, education and even distribution of the country's wealth, will bring out the animalistic instincts in humans to kill to survive. In Trinidad, the killers are still those in survival mode, this can escalate into an enterprise. But we are about to spend 12 million dollars on Carnival in Tobego and more so in Trinidad , as residence are scrambling for food to eat, this tell us a lot about humans. Despite the thin decorative covering of civilization that envelops man, retains deep-seated animalistic instincts that can drive him to kill in order to survive. These primal urges, rooted in our evolutionary history, have been ingrained in our genetic makeup for millions of years and can surface in the most extreme circumstances, revealing the raw, survival-driven nature that lurks beneath the surface of all of us. 1. Fight or Flight Response: The most fundamental of these instincts is the ""fight or flight"" response. When faced with a life-threatening situation, the body's autonomic nervous system triggers a cascade of physiological changes that prepare us to either confront the threat or flee from it. In situations where escape is not an option, the instinct to fight to the death may take over. 2. Hunting and Gathering Instincts: Throughout human history, our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, relying on their ability to hunt animals and gather edible plants for sustenance. This hunting instinct, deeply ingrained in our DNA, still exists within us, and in dire situations, it can drive individuals to kill other creatures, including other humans, in search of food, money or valuables. 3. Territoriality and Resource Competition: Many animals are territorial and fiercely defend their territory and resources against intruders. In human societies, this instinct has evolved into a drive to protect one's home, family, and possessions. In extreme situations where resources are scarce or in high demand, individuals may resort to violence to secure what they need for themselves and their loved ones. 4. Social Hierarchies and Dominance: Just as in many animal species, humans have hierarchical structures within their societies. The desire for dominance and status can lead to conflicts and aggression. In some cases, individuals may resort to killing rivals or challengers in order to maintain or enhance their position in the social hierarchy. Some believe the poor in society has its place, which is to do the hard and dirty work, cleaning roads and garbage collecting. 5. Group Dynamics and Survival: Humans are inherently social creatures, and our survival instincts extend to the protection of our social groups. In situations of perceived threat or conflict, individuals may feel compelled to eliminate perceived enemies or threats to the group's survival, even if it means taking another person's life. 6. Desperation and Fear: When pushed to the brink of survival, individuals can experience extreme fear and desperation. These emotions can override moral and ethical considerations, leading people to commit acts of violence that they might otherwise find abhorrent. 7. Psychological Factors: In some cases, mental health issues or psychological trauma can amplify these instincts. Individuals suffering from severe psychological distress may be more prone to acts of violence as they grapple with their inner turmoil. It is essential to emphasize that while these instincts are deeply rooted in our biology, human society has developed complex systems of laws, norms, and ethics to temper and control them. Most people live their lives without resorting to violence to survive, relying instead on cooperation, empathy, and the rule of law. However, understanding the existence of these instincts can shed light on the potential for violence in extreme circumstances, and it underscores the importance of nurturing a society that promotes peaceful coexistence and conflict resolution.

facebook,"""But sometimes my child just has to get with the program!"" Who's program are we talking about here? Externally imposed structures are usually designed without neurodivergence in mind, and directly conflict with the structures neurodivergent need to regulate themselves. As parents and caregivers, you are in the difficult position of being responsible for putting in structures to help your autistic child thrive. It can be a big change in thinking to realise that the structures, routines and rituals neurodivergent people put in place may actually be serving a helpful purpose. Many people instinctively see these as being bad or symptoms of disorder so then try to train the person out of it or discipline them for doing this. This is quite harmful to neurodivergent people. Instead of imposing rigid rules that take away your child's coping strategies, it is better to work collaboratively to first understand why neurodivergent people are doing what they are doing, and then working with them to develop structures that best support their growth and ability to thrive.",,284,"{'like_count': 154, 'comment_count': 24, 'num_users': 241566}",Dr Justin Coulson's Happy Families,,2023-10-06 06:03:23,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/249902758_445572886925201_6694593989609708378_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=9GyF0rE_eAQAX92emuL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAKa04G-_R9keMGO0gjmwZizJ4puwuKYEXV4wU0_vPsSg&oe=655B8410,https://www.facebook.com/100044174812567/posts/885662396249579,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385090386_885660909583061_2772770197909002706_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YPqVvySZN_kAX_Y9JhT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC_9UioZtnWH-_Wtr7cw2Y-_22Ao8PEVx5vicrbkX4VwA&oe=655989B9

facebook,"Why is the FEAST of the OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY, on every October 7th? 
..... The story of the  VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY at the Battle of Lepanto, on OCTOBER  7, 1571.

IN TIMES OF ACUTE DANGER AND HARDSHIP, WE MUST ALWAYS FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD AND TURN TO THE RECITATION OF HER HOLY ROSARY. The Battle of Lepanto is a great lesson of confidence for us today. 

When Saint Pius V became Pope, Christendom faced the perils perhaps unequaled in its history of continual conflict with the violent followers of Mohammed. All the information and intelligence that Pope Pius V had been gathering indicated that the Ottoman juggernaut was about to roll across the Mediterranean and adjacent lands, spearheaded by the Turkish fleet, with Italy and Rome as one of its target. (The Ottoman Empire is also historically known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire)

Only Spain and Venice had the resources to resist, and they hated each other along with deep mistrust. Yet Saint Pius ‚Äî calling down divine grace as only a man of prayer could ‚Äî forged an alliance with them as the core of an organized fleet of over 200 galleys. With his considerable tact and diplomatic skills, he not only kept them unified, but he convinced them to attack the enveloping menace.

The Archbishop of Mexico had an exact copy of the HOLY IMAGE OF THE LADY OF GUADALUPE sent to King Philip II, who in turn gave it to Andrea Doria, one of the three principal admirals of the fleet, who placed it in his cabin. When the Armada went from file to line abreast and attacked on the morning of OCTOBER 7, 1571 the blue standard of OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE was also flying from the masthead of Don Juan‚Äôs flagship. 

Pope Pius V, a Dominican prelate before becoming a Pope, did what Catholics have always done in times of acute danger: FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD. As a follower of Saint Dominic, HE KNEW THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF IMPLORING HER HELP WAS THROUGH THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY. He ordered all monasteries and convents in Rome to increase their prayers for the impending battle and organized ROSARY PROCESSIONS in which he, as sick as he was, participated. OUR LADY‚ÄôS PRESENCE THAT DAY WAS MORE ACUTELY FELT THROUGH THE HOLY ROSARY.

As the Christian fleet sailed toward the great clash, MASS WAS CELEBRATED AND THE ROSARY RECITED DAILY ON EACH VESSEL‚Ä¶.. THIS HEARTFELT REQUEST FOR DIVINE ASSISTANCE RESULTED IN A CRUSHING DEFEAT OF THE OTTOMANS AT LEPANTO THAT ENDED THEIR DOMINANCE AND CRUELTY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. OCTOBER 7, 1571, WAS THE VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY, EVEN IF THE CHRISTIAN FLEET WAS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE OTTOMAN FLEET.

TO CELEBRATE OUR LADY‚ÄôS INTERCESSION AND VICTORY, THE CHURCH HAS DESIGNATED OCTOBER 7 AS THE FEAST OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY. Similar acknowledgement to the Blessed Virgin‚Äôs intercession through the Rosary were made when John Sobieski forced the Turks to lift the Siege of Vienna in 1683 and after the victory of Prince Eugene of Savoy at Temesvar in his successful campaign to remove the Ottomans from Europe in the next century.",,268,"{'like_count': 106, 'comment_count': 40, 'num_users': 1312022}",üíì God's Love üíì,,2023-10-06 15:40:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/299036861_3319226645066167_5373952877122071821_n.jpg?stp=c0.6.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Kf3hKLeWbSMAX8EAaSg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCyslBOmDF2fGtVzGH-XiIP5FFf8XcHGlVA5qwZa1FXYw&oe=655B4ADA,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1072233246139506/permalink/7501278776568222,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386786913_6622074261203396_5928534652368284138_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=bURTo-1_snoAX_KWbD0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA2NnUYE6-kj6Iku93uPzFgyccogTtEKW-mnvoRjnTXGw&oe=652C3E3F

facebook,"In 1889, nearly 100,000 coal miners went on strike in Germany to demand higher wages and shorter workdays. These strikes pushed Emperor Wilhelm II to introduce a labor reform program. He called for a conference with other European leaders on how to manage the growing demands of united workers. In 1890, European political elites gathered in Germany to attend this conference on labor standards for coal mining and employment limits for women and children. As the conference began, coal miners in England and Wales launched a wage strike that grew to about 260,000 participants, including women and children. A New York Times article warned of ‚Äúthe possibilities of a gigantic and ruinous labor conflict open[ing] before us‚Äù if coal owners did not accept worker demands. In the 1900s, Western elites would increasingly invest in alternative, oil-based energy systems to avoid the effective strikes and labor power that characterized coal production.

The Military are putting on measures to ensure the closer of all satellite markets and lorry stations at the outskirts are closed by Monday. Since the beginning of this conflict in 2021, we have always maintained that the satellite markets and lorry stations should be closed down for both Mamprusi, Kusasi and all the other tribes to operate from same market and stations, not because we can't be on our own but for us all to coexist for the conflict to die.

facebook,"The Hidden Struggles of Work Addiction... Often, we're praised for our work addiction, but it can be a destructive force. When professional success comes at the cost of failing relationships and neglecting loved ones, it's not true success. As the go-to person, finding help can seem impossible, but it's necessary. Using work as an escape only makes things worse, exacerbating problems at home. Avoidance of conflict and familial issues can lead to a cycle of self-deception and procrastination, eroding the very life you've built. Many experience the same struggles, trapped in the cycle of denial and evasion. The first step is to reach out, break free from self-deception, and seek support. Don't let work addiction define your life; there's a path to balance and fulfillment. ü§ù #WorkAddiction #SeekHelp #BreakTheCycle",,237,"{'like_count': 105, 'comment_count': 26, 'num_users': 168709}",Beyond Driven,,2023-10-06 17:29:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311582895_437443235169810_4535845519067914607_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rU2D9V4JZuAAX8ZAiDh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDlHWnU_xHAnN_WDj8ZcDZyhFdmAaXMjdxV8NdaOXO12A&oe=6559DB3F,https://www.facebook.com/100067000762728/posts/642706354639384,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/370253118_283821314601419_8528293199850010428_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad6a45&_nc_ohc=YIkZBpxBu7wAX9C6wPj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDAFlz_sczi5AkyPFEXWj6pjMdDRmVFe2Un7a0NrpSktg&oe=652C0ECD
facebook,"HOW TO PREVENT FINANCES FROM RUINING YOUR RELATIONSHIP/ MARRIAGE: Money: the lack or plenty of it, the use or misuse of it; money can be a source of conflict and strain in a relationship/ marriage. These are some of the ways to ensuring money does not become an impediment to the health of your love; 1. LOVE THE PERSON NOT THEIR MONEY Don't let money be the reason you love a person. For money can come and go, sometimes we make losses at times profit. If your love for someone is based on their wealth or lack of it then it is not love but a commercial opportunity. Don't peg love on money. 2. DISCLOSE YOUR OWN YOUR FINANCIAL TRAIL Tell your partner your financial background, if you have debt, if you were once wealthy then got broke and why, if you have plenty and how you got to be so rich. Your partner needs to know who he/ she is committing to. 3. EARN A LIVING THAT IS FULFILLING Pursue a job or income activity you love. If you hate your work it will affect your peace and joy, you'll be bringing your frustrations home to your partner, ever complaining and bitter why you work so hard in something you hate so that you two can meet needs. When you love your work, you enjoy paying for the daily bread 4. BOTH OF YOU SHOULD CONTRIBUTE Pay bills together, pick bills and items each of you will pay for. She can pay for house needs, he school fees. Both of you should find ways to contribute as this will not make anyone feel overburdened or useless. When someone gives they have more confidence and joy. Even a man who demands to be the sole provider will admire and respect a woman who can earn and handle finances too. 5. BE AWARE OF EACH OTHER'S CAPACITY Even as you both contribute it doesn't necessarily mean you two will be individually on the same financial level. Don't discriminate or look down on each other based on capacity, you are in this together. 6. GROW TOGETHER Whatever little or much you have as individuals or a couple, there is still room for growth. They say no romance without finance but actually love motivates people to grow, when people have a target for their love they become better especially if the person walks with them towards financial growth. 7. BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT Be financially naked, be an open book. Have a joint bank account if you agree, have access and information. Tell your partner when you're broke or when you get a lucrative deal. You don't really trust your partner if you don't trust him/ her with your finances. 8. HAVE A COMMON FINANCIAL GOAL Analyze the health of your finances together, scout for opportunities, formulate short, mid and long term financial plans, work as a team. Have a common purpose, invest, save together. 9. MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS TOGETHER Even if it is money you individually earned, involve your partner when making financial decisions. Involve your partner before making a purchase as this enhances teamwork, joint ownership, and trust. Agree together which car to buy, which house to live in, what to have as priority. 10. LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS Don't spend more than you earn. Don't force yourself to live in a class bracket you cannot sustain, instead, work towards getting to that class. Be financial disciplined and plan for what's ahead. 11. ENJOY WEALTH TOGETHER No need to work so hard yet you don't enjoy your wealth. Spoil yourselves, treat yourself with the fruit of your joint labor. You deserve it. 12. REFRAIN FROM USING FINANCES AS A WEAPON Avoid financial abuse especially if you are the one who earns more. Don't revenge or fight your partner with financial sanctions or intimidation when things are not good between you two. Don't go down that love threatening road. 13. AVOID DEBT As much as you can, avoid debt. Even if you will take loans, work on being self sufficient as a couple as soon as possible. Aim for surplus. 14. KEEP OFF COPING OTHER COUPLES AND TRENDS Even if you see other couples spending big, buying fancy cars, mortgaging mansions, living a high life; don't fall into the temptation of copying them. Find your own lifestyle which you can comfortably sustain. Don't let the pressure to fit in or your desire for a glossy public image mislead you to making crippling financial decisions. 15. COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER'S FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS Some people are brilliant creatives but poor at managing resources, others are spendthrifts, others are good at managing but not good at earning money, others have alot of money but others have ideas that need financing. Find out each other's strengths and weaknesses and work as a team in forming a powerful financial force. 16. REMEMBER WEALTH IS NOT A TICKET TO HAVING AFFAIRS Even when you get abundance of wealth, remain faithful. Don't use your wealth to get pleasure on the side, use your wealth to love your partner even more.",,234,"{'like_count': 161, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 507915}",Thoughts of Jacktone,,2023-10-06 04:21:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338001205_1368720427298146_7411246640499111275_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y2RUnb3oDQYAX-HSA0u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBqyqTelr8rLeEt81yumQygWi0FvjjsEBUdmYP8UoZ7VA&oe=655B2E12,https://www.facebook.com/100064148888578/posts/716246493856974,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385902375_716246267190330_7022800921509471048_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=_u3V3ymoYGUAX_qJfv0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDI5TSHXTzridPaIeMf3wdJWeBBceAJ9Yvn9CuvEvmMOA&oe=65256E3F

facebook,"A Case of Religious Fear Mongering, or Celestial Battle? The account itself was first recorded by a publicist named Hanns Glaser. He was mostly known for being caught stealing woodcuts from other competitors to sell them as his own. He was also known for sharing highly inflated versions of seemingly normal events. Hanns would later find himself in a situation that would ultimately end his career as a publicist, which was more copyright infringement. Regardless of his moral character, he always did his best to captivate his audience, even if it meant stealing someone else's work or fabricating events to make his own work more interesting. One example of this was recorded in a depiction of the Aurora Borealis. Instead of waves of color in the sky, he illustrated them as flames shooting towards the ground, and described it with obvious religious undertones. This religious-mania fear mongering is apparent in the text below, first recorded in 1561, the famous account of Nuremberg's battle in the sky. Also, quoted below the account recorded by Glaser is a similar account from a Swedish newspaper. The written account itself shares the same type of religious undertones, however this account is accompanied by numerous images provided by other eye witnesses. These images offer a more logical understanding of what they were viewing. It is in fact nothing more than an early documented record of sundogs. By Hanns Glaser, letter-painter of Nuremberg ""In the morning of April 14, 1561, at daybreak, between 4 and 5 a.m., a dreadful apparition occurred on the sun, and then this was seen in Nuremberg in the city, before the gates and in the country ‚Äì by many men and women. At first there appeared in the middle of the sun two blood-red semi-circular arcs, just like the moon in its last quarter. And in the sun, above and below and on both sides, the color was blood, there stood a round ball of partly dull, partly black ferrous color. Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth ‚Äòas if they all burned‚Äô and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke. After all this there was something like a black spear, very long and thick, sighted; the shaft pointed to the east, the point pointed west. Whatever such signs mean, God alone knows. Although we have seen, shortly one after another, many kinds of signs on the heaven, which are sent to us by the almighty God, to bring us to repentance, we still are, unfortunately, so ungrateful that we despise such high signs and miracles of God. Or we speak of them with ridicule and discard them to the wind, in order that God may send us a frightening punishment on account of our ungratefulness. After all, the God-fearing will by no means discard these signs, but will take it to heart as a warning of their merciful Father in heaven, will mend their lives and faithfully beg God, that He may avert His wrath, including the well-deserved punishment, on us, so that we may temporarily here and perpetually there, live as his children. For it, may God grant us his help, Amen."" ================ Article in a Swedish Newspaper ""It happened in 1566 three times, on 27 and 28 of July, and on August 7, against the sunrise and sunset; we saw strange shapes in the sky above Basel. During the year 1566, on the 27th of July, after the sun had shone warm on the clear, bright skies, and then around 9 pm, it suddenly took a different shape and color. First, the sun lost all its radiance and luster, and it was no bigger than the full moon, and finally it seemed to weep tears of blood and the air behind him went dark. And he was seen by all the people of the city and countryside. In much the same way also the moon, which has already been almost full and has shone through the night, assuming an almost blood-red color in the sky. The next day, Sunday, the sun rose at about six o'clock and slept with the same appearance it had when it was lying before. He lit the houses, streets and around as if (truncated)",,221,"{'like_count': 134, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 51155}",Eat The Fruit Inc.,,2023-10-06 14:00:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/326931589_1634420763687401_5184872984164655341_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hgkCsFzu_q8AX81GPMv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCukpTVcsLEQb6_pzjOFqhttIwdLHYZP4SRnUuD2mleMw&oe=655B0D35,https://www.facebook.com/100064412605358/posts/711776860979394,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/378386780_709321734558240_3988863622520243601_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=Vmh5DRBhqX4AX-Zwh3O&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBdNKAaOL5ifABlvzHXVpTu7cFi2vrPhgyNWg38vrCMlA&oe=6524C12B

UN urge authorities to protect him, his family & home, & hold perpetrators accountable. The home of human rights activist Babloo Loitongbam‚Äôs in Manipur‚Äôs Imphal was on Thursday attacked by unidentified people, a senior police official told Scroll. ‚ÄúHe is claiming here that no church is standing in Imphal valley, all burned,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúThis claim made the public angry.‚Äù Loitongbam had made the statement in an interview he gave to NewsClick in May. He had also spoken about the state of violence in Manipur, especially on the role of radical organisations. The internationally acclaimed activist has been critical of the Meitei Leepun and the Aarambai Tenggol, radical Meitei organisations accused of fanning violence against Kukis. Since the ethnic conflict broke out on May 3, Loitongbam has been demanding that Chief Minister N Biren Singh, a Metei, resign from his post. In the interview, the activist alleged that the Meitei Leepun and the Aarambai Tenggol have ‚Äúinjected‚Äù militancy into the minds of people. ‚ÄúThey have articulation like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,‚Äù Loitongbam said. ‚ÄúNot a single church stands in the valley now.

On Wednesday, the two groups stormed her home and demanded a clarification. She then said she was misinformed by a social media video. On Thursday, the Meitei Leepun also warned that it will not take responsibility for any unwanted incidents if Brinda and Loitongbam violate the boycott.

I don't care that it was all just about the last battle; I enjoyed the detail and all of the moving parts. But I really think that another book could have been written to wrap things up properly. There are so many loose ends because as soon as the last battle was done, that was the end of the book lol. The Aiel and Tinkers never got to sing with the Ogier and Rand, which I was hoping was going to be a big event. Mat even heard the song before. The Black Tower was hardly a big part of the story. I would have liked to see what became of everyone after the last battle as well. I think that the Perrin/Slayer conflict was drawn out too much.

facebook,"Nations Trust WNPS Monthly Lecture WILDLIFE AND WILDERNESS IN THE NORTH Largely ignored but of vital value By Dr S Wijeyamohan 6 pm, 19th October 2023, Jasmine Hall, BMICH On the ending of the war in 2009, immediate visitors to the North and the East were astonished at the sight of pristine forests, unlike many left in the remainder of the country, intact and preserved and beautiful, vast tracts of forest and large numbers of wildlife endured. That was 14 years ago, and the narration has changed since. Today, there are reports of rampant deforestation and the killing of wildlife taking place here. Human-elephant Conflict has reached levels never seen before. Yet, just as during the War, information on this barely trickles through to the general public and they remain blissfully unaware that the Nation‚Äôs Natural Wealth is being ravaged here, as it is in much of the rest of the island, at a rate never seen before. Are these areas, freed with considerable human and financial cost, all to be destroyed in a couple of decades? What of the revenue these wonderful places and creatures could bring to the country, and the local communities, if they are protected and shown off to the World? Are we to sacrifice the future on the altar of greed?, Dr. S. Wijeyamohan is well known in conservation circles as someone who has long championed the cause of conservation in the North and the East. Specializing in Wildlife Ecology, Conservation and Management, he is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Bio-science of the University of Vavuniya. There can be none better than Dr. Wijeyamohan to help us understand the reality, and lift the fog of ignorance of these vastly biodiverse, and increasingly threatened, vitally precious areas of this Nation. The monthly lecture of the WNPS is supported by the Nations Trust Bank. It is open to both members and non-members, ENTRANCE FREE.

facebook,"October 06, 2023 DEEP PEACE IN PEACE PROFOUND, AS OUR SOUL‚ÄôS HERITAGE AND BIRTHRIGHT ÔÇß Deep Peace, known to Rosicrucians as Peace Profound, comes from within, and in wisdom of the soul. We gain access to this wisdom and its peace by facing and surmounting challenges as necessary catalyst for growth and evolution in life, without which, life becomes stale and stagnant. We meet challenges, stress and conflict, first, in intellect and emotions, and later, we deal with those same issues externally. We find inner peace of the soul by facing the storm and turmoil of the Unknown internally first as we learn to bravely face the ‚ÄòTerror of the Threshold.‚Äô Metaphorically speaking, inspiration from our soul creates veritable inner battleground; wounds are struck by love and compassion; shattered bones are brought about by strong desire on the Path to unite with God of our Understanding and Greatest Yearning. Attunement with the soul becomes reality, when we understand, fight, struggle and give our best for the soul. It cannot be sought casually in times of extreme distress, or just by going to temple in belief that this is enough to unite with our soul. Our attunement must be constant guiding light as soul merges with our outer daily living in volition and control. With good level of attunement, energy flows through us at all times. Benefits of Attunement ÔÇß With inspiration from our soul, definite challenges manifest within ourselves on how to conduct our outer lives with energy, dynamism and potential to accomplish in life what helps us to forward on inner plane of awareness. This ‚Äòinner motion‚Äô translates to outer motion to improve our lives. Through attunement, we receive wisdom, inspiration and energy necessary to succeed in our work, achieve harmony in personal relationships, and find inner peace. We receive guideline on ‚Äúour most important aim in life‚Äù, by listening to our Inner Voice of the soul as Guiding Light of life. This is key to achieving oneness and attunement as part of our lives. Attunement together with its attendant knowledge and inspiration, brings right implementation in spirit and intention. Promptings of our soul are always good for us and those nearest and dearest to us, as our soul ceaselessly places us in situations where we face our various un-compensated-for elements in people, animals and scenarios within our ‚Äòkarmic proximity‚Äô. We assist this process to the letter of the law by observing the manifested results. With confidence in received advice and guidance from ‚ÄòStill Small Voice Within‚Äô, as our ‚ÄòInner Master‚Äô for necessary implementation, we stop further analysis of received impression, through accurate guidance of our capable Master-Guide in The Unlimited Potential Of our Soul. As long as our connection remains, and we heed the voice of our Inner Master, we have periods of intense happiness, great tranquility and Peace Profound, under the most trying outer conditions. The Eternal Quest ÔÇß Mystics are veritable knights in shining armor, fighting inner battles in cause of good where the knight knows the safety of the soul and experiences dangers of straying away from it. As ardent seekers of our deeper spiritual insight, we explore with great care and tenderness the great wisdom of the soul with sublime serenity in presence of the Infinite and the Eternal as we integrate with our soul, amidst periods of great fear and loneliness when we temporarily stray away from its Presence to forget its profound wisdom. The depths of the soul are discovered through the intensity of our desire, and we receive in accordance with universal law and willingness to give first, and patiently wait for just and right rewards, even if those rewards take more than single lifetime to come to fruition. When our consciousness extends to all nature, we are one with the Infinite and Eternal in what Rosicrucians refer to as the ‚ÄòGod of our Heart.‚Äô At this point on the Path, we reach new, higher realization of ourselves. We are one with nature, harmony, peace and strength, and we remain there as long as we retain open channel of communication with our soul. The challenge brought tension and inner turmoil in its wake, but we overcome them and with total, deep Peace in Peace Profound, harmony and profound understanding as nature of our soul, heritage and birthright.

facebook,"Something that's definitely worth thinking about: if our children learn harsh, reactive, loud, unkind behaviors from us as parents, and we focus on disciplining them, but not ourselves, we're being hypocritical. And they know it. Improved emotional regulation, conflict resolution, patience, kindness, respect, honor, and responsibility in our children has to start with the parents, caregivers, and teachers who influence the child. And no, changed behavior in adults doesn't equal immediately changed behavior in children. A child's brain takes 2.5 decades to develop, and even longer for neurodiverse children! But ultimately, what we expect from our children must be modeled for them by us.

facebook,"OUR DAILY MANNA 07 October 2023 THOUGHTS ON TODAY‚ÄôS VERSE... Peace is more than the mercurial, vaporous, whimsical wish of folks who want everyone to get along and things to be calm. The peace the apostle Paul describes is true peace with God. This peace goes much deeper than simply our desire for calmness and a lack of conflict. Jesus, through his sacrificial obedience to God, has made peace with God real for us. Yes, God provided it by grace. Yes, God is the one who ensures it because of that grace. But, because this peace is tied to him and his character, we can rejoice and anticipate being caught up in the glory of our majestic and holy God in whom we have eternal peace. MY PRAYER... O majestic and holy God on high, I praise you for the gift of your grace in Jesus. Please give me confidence and trust to stand in your grace and be emboldened to live for you with a life full of holiness, anticipation, and joy. In Jesus' name, I pray.

facebook,"UN Human Rights are alarmed by threats to human rights defender Babloo Loitongbam by Meitei Leepun & Arambai Tengol groups in Manipur for speaking out on inter-communal violence since May.  UN urge authorities to protect him, his family & home, & hold perpetrators accountable.

The home of human rights activist Babloo Loitongbam‚Äôs in Manipur‚Äôs Imphal was on Thursday attacked by unidentified people, a senior police official told Scroll.

‚ÄúHe is claiming here that no church is standing in Imphal valley, all burned,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúThis claim made the public angry.‚Äù

Loitongbam had made the statement in an interview he gave to NewsClick in May. He had also spoken about the state of violence in Manipur, especially on the role of radical organisations.

The internationally acclaimed activist has been critical of the Meitei Leepun and the Aarambai Tenggol, radical Meitei organisations accused of fanning violence against Kukis.

Since the ethnic conflict broke out on May 3, Loitongbam has been demanding that Chief Minister N Biren Singh, a Metei, resign from his post.

In the interview, the activist alleged that the Meitei Leepun and the Aarambai Tenggol have ‚Äúinjected‚Äù militancy into the minds of people.

‚ÄúThey have articulation like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,‚Äù Loitongbam said. ‚ÄúNot a single church stands in the valley now. All churches are being The activist‚Äôs home was attacked on the same day when the Meitei Leepun said it will boycott Loitongbam and former Additional Superintendent of Police Thounaojam Brinda till the ethnic strife ends over making public statements, reported the Ukhrul Times destroyed.‚Äù

Brinda had said the Meitei Leepun and the Aarambai Tenggol were responsible for an arson incident, reported India Today. On Wednesday, the two groups stormed her home and demanded a clarification. She then said she was misinformed by a social media video.

On Thursday, the Meitei Leepun also warned that it will not take responsibility for any unwanted incidents if Brinda and Loitongbam violate the boycott.

In a old interview last month to The Wire with Karan Thapar, Babloo Loitongbam repeatedly flagged potential threats to his safety. His home in Imphal was attacked yesterday.

facebook,"Why is the FEAST of The OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY, on every October 7th? The Feast Day of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary we celebrate on Oct. 7 originated from the victory of Lepanto (1571) attributed to the maternal intercession of Our Lady. It was instituted by Saint Pius V to commemorate and thank the Virgin for her help in the victory over the Turks at Lepanto on October 7, 1571. Saint Pius V established this feast in 1573. Clement XI extended the feast to the universal Church in 1716. IN TIMES OF ACUTE DANGER AND HARDSHIP, WE MUST ALWAYS FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD AND TURN TO THE RECITATION OF HER HOLY ROSARY. The Battle of Lepanto is a great lesson of confidence for us today. When Saint Pius V became Pope, Christendom faced the perils perhaps unequaled in its history of continual conflict with the violent followers of Mohammed. All the information and intelligence that Pope Pius V had been gathering indicated that the Ottoman juggernaut was about to roll across the Mediterranean and adjacent lands, spearheaded by the Turkish fleet, with Italy and Rome as one of its target. (The Ottoman Empire is also historically known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire) Only Spain and Venice had the resources to resist, and they hated each other along with deep mistrust. Yet Saint Pius ‚Äî calling down divine grace as only a man of prayer could ‚Äî forged an alliance with them as the core of an organized fleet of over 200 galleys. With his considerable tact and diplomatic skills, he not only kept them unified, but he convinced them to attack the enveloping menace. The Archbishop of Mexico had an exact copy of the HOLY IMAGE OF THE LADY OF GUADALUPE sent to King Philip II, who in turn gave it to Andrea Doria, one of the three principal admirals of the fleet, who placed it in his cabin. When the Armada went from file to line abreast and attacked on the morning of OCTOBER 7, 1571 the blue standard of OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE was also flying from the masthead of Don Juan‚Äôs flagship. Pope Pius V, a Dominican prelate before becoming a Pope, did what Catholics have always done in times of acute danger: FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD. As a follower of Saint Dominic, HE KNEW THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF IMPLORING HER HELP WAS THROUGH THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY. He ordered all monasteries and convents in Rome to increase their prayers for the impending battle and organized ROSARY PROCESSIONS in which he, as sick as he was, participated. OUR LADY‚ÄôS PRESENCE THAT DAY WAS MORE ACUTELY FELT THROUGH THE HOLY ROSARY. On the eve of battle, the men of THE HOLY LEAGUE PREPARED THEIR SOULS BY FALLING TO THEIR KNEES ON THE DECKS OF THEIR GALLEYS AND PRAYING THE ROSARY. At dawn on October 7, 1571, the Holy League rowed down the west coast of Greece and turned east into the Gulf of Patras. When the morning mist cleared, the Christians, rowing directly against the wind, saw the squadrons of the larger Ottoman fleet arrayed like a crescent from shore to shore, bearing down on them under full sail. As the fleets grew closer, the Christians could hear the gongs and cymbals, drums and cries of the Turks. The men of the Holy League quietly pulled at their oars, the soldiers stood on the decks in silent prayer. PRIESTS HOLDING LARGE CRUCIFIXES MARCHED UP AND DOWN THE DECKS EXHORTING THE MEN TO BE BRAVE AND HEARING FINAL CONFESSIONS. .......THEN THE BLESSED VIRGIN INTERVENED! ....... The wind shifted 180 degrees. The sails of the Holy League were filled with the Divine breath, driving them into battle. As the Christian fleet sailed toward the great clash, MASS WAS CELEBRATED AND THE ROSARY RECITED DAILY ON EACH VESSEL‚Ä¶.. THIS HEARTFELT REQUEST FOR DIVINE ASSISTANCE RESULTED IN A CRUSHING DEFEAT OF THE OTTOMANS AT LEPANTO THAT ENDED THEIR DOMINANCE AND CRUELTY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. OCTOBER 7, 1571, WAS THE VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY, EVEN IF THE CHRISTIAN FLEET WAS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE OTTOMAN FLEET. TO CELEBRATE OUR LADY‚ÄôS INTERCESSION AND VICTORY, THE CHURCH HAS DESIGNATED OCTOBER 7 AS THE FEAST OF OUR LADY OF VICTORIES AND LATER ON TO OUR LADY OF THE HOLY ROSARY. By popular acclamation, the advocation ‚ÄúHelp of Christians‚Äù was added to the Litany of Loreto. Chapels with the invocation of Our Lady of Victories begin to emerge in Spain and Italy. At the Venetian Senate hangs a painting of the battle which the following inscription below it: ""Non virtus, non arma, non duces, sed Maria Rosarii victores nos fecit (Neither the troops nor weapons, nor the commanders, but Mary of the Rosary who made us the victorious)."" Similar acknowledgement to the Blessed Virgin‚Äôs intercession through the Rosary were made when John Sobieski forced the Turks to lift the Siege of Vienna in 1683 and after the victory of Prince Eugene of Savoy at Temesvar in his successful campaign to remove the Ottomans from Europe in the next century. True Victory comes from God through the intercession of (truncated)",,160,"{'like_count': 47, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 54362}",Lay Catholic Online,,2023-10-06 06:11:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/179427714_321078456036219_6986265728679940010_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=x_Sv4_nbI-EAX-0jdhf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAl5W13XR8oG8lPNQPCt-t8K8AUwcZJ2WjCjbd7gwX7vA&oe=657D4090,https://www.facebook.com/100044022014398/posts/869974914479901,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385777157_869974894479903_2508765460284381552_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=0kscTQPKslMAX9ycqhj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC5SkkwhPkmTSWFwbFRe9K3pVGIWyJnSEf9uuISznvkKw&oe=65242608

facebook,"‚ÄúThe nature of humanity, it's essence, is to feel another's pain as one's own, and to act to take that pain away. There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness."" TINGNAN: KAPAMILYA NG DALAWANG REBELDENG NASAWI SA ENGKWENTRO DUMULOG SA HIMPILAN NG PULIS DARAGA Malugod na pagtanggap ang ipinadama ng kapulisan ng Daraga MPS sa kapamilya ng mga rebeldeng nasawi sa madugong ingkwentro na naganap sa Brgy. Bascaran, Daraga, Albay tatlong araw ang nakalipas. Nitong Huwebes, Oktubre 5, 2023, naglakas loob na kumatok sa tanggapan ni PLTCOL EDMUNDO A CERILLO JR., Hepe ng Daraga MPS ang naiwang kapamilya ng mga nasawing rebelde upang humingi ng tulong asistensya na mabigyan ang mga ito ng maayos na libing. Bakas sa kanilang mga mukha ang labis na pagdadalamhati at pangungulila. Sa kabila ng sagupaang naganap sa pagitan ng nasabing rebeldeng grupo at mga alagad ng batas, mas nanaig pa rin ang kabutihang loob ng ating kapulisan. Hindi nagdalawang isip si PLTCOL CERILLO JR na paunlakan ang kanilang pakiusap. Bukod dito, hinandogan din sila ni PLTCOL CERILLO JR. ng tulong pinansyal at muling nagpaabot ng pakikiramay. Dahil sa tulong na handog ng Pulis Daraga, labis-labis ang kanilang pasasalamat. Humingi rin sila ng paumanhin sa mga nagawang paglabag sa batas ng rebeldeng grupong kinabibilangan ng mga nasawi, partikular ang tangkang pamamaslang sa apat na kapulisan ng Daraga MPS BPAC. Anila, wala man lang silang natanggap na anumang tulong mula sa mga kasamahan ng kanilang mga kaanak na nasawi na labis na ikinasasama ng kanilang kalooban. Ang pagtanggap na ito sa kapamilya ng mga nasawing rebelde ay patunay lamang na ‚ÄúANG PULIS DARAGA AY HINDI KAAWAY AT HANGAD NAMIN ANG KAPAYAPAAN AT LIGTAS NA BAYAN‚Äù. Muli kaming nanawagan sa ating mga kapatid na nabubulag sa maling ideolohiya at mapanlinlang na doktrina ng teroristang grupo. Walang mabuting dulot ang paggamit ng armas at pagpapalaganap ng karahasan. Maraming buhay na ang nasayang, maraming pamilya na ang nawalan ng mahal sa buhay. Huwag ninyong ipagkait sa inyong mga anak, asawa, magulang at kapamilya ang pagkakaroon ng masaya, malaya at tahimik na buhay. Magbalik-loob na sa pamahalaan upang mabigyan ng pagkakataong makapag-bagong buhay kasama ang pamilya sa tulong ng Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration program (E-CLIP) at ng iba pang programa sa ilalim ng National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTf-ELCAC). #SerbisyongNagkakaisa #WeServeAndProtect #PNPGoodDeeds Daraga Public Information Office PNP Kasurog Bicol PCADG Bicol Region Albay Police Provincial Office Ed Cerillo Jr.",,152,"{'like_count': 58, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 5468}",Daraga Municipal Police Station,,2023-10-06 00:03:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242924916_230540155770900_2415888395463140792_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=shEdnf-ziH8AX9_pqla&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAI87Cd0LBaSTFYpbWivQsx8CdHaQIxP3g7Tv2gLZ-PAw&oe=655B38C3,https://www.facebook.com/100064447521674/posts/727832682708309,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386995822_727832659374978_2102641167167259715_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=9isAhS5AgQUAX8TPTRW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCewQG7ivZQ3ts9eejazTbjRJH85eWyJCKaF5wm0hBPuQ&oe=655580CC

OUR LADY OF THE HOLY ROSARY 
     NOVENA PRAYER (DAILY) 

*My dearest Mother Mary, behold me, your child, in prayer at your feet. Accept this Holy Rosary, which I offer you in accordance with your requests at Fatima, as a proof of my tender love for you, for the intentions of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in atonement for the offenses committed against your Immaculate Heart, and for this special favor which I earnestly request in my Rosary Novena: (Mention your request).*

*I beg you to present my petition to your Divine Son. If you will pray for me, I cannot be refused. I know, dearest Mother, that you want me to seek Gods holy Will concerning my request. If what I ask for should not be granted, pray that I may receive that which will be of greater benefit to my soul.*

*I offer you this spiritual  Bouquet of Roses,  because I love you. I put all my confidence in you, since your prayers before God are most powerful. For the greater glory of God and for the sake of Jesus, your loving Son, hear and grant my prayer. Sweet Heart of Mary, be my salvation. Amen*

NINETH DAY PRAYER

Ah, my Queen, continue to guard me from hell; for what will thy mercy and the favours thou hast shown me avail me if I am lost? If I did not always love, now at least-after God-I love thee above all things. Never allow me to turn my back on thee or on God, Who, by thy intercession, has granted me so many graces. Love me, 0 Mary, my hope; save me from hell. But save me first from sin which alone can condemn me to it.Amen*

   *Queen of the most holy Rosary, in these times of such brazen impiety, manifest thy power with the signs of thine ancient victories, and from thy throne, whence thou dost dispense pardon and graces, mercifully regard the Church of thy Son, His Vicar on earth, and every order of clergy and laity, who are sore oppressed in the mighty conflict. Do thou, who art the powerful vanquisher of all heresies, hasten the hour of mercy, even though the hour of God's justice is every day provoked by the countless sins of men. For me, who am the least of men, kneeling before thee in supplication, do thou obtain the grace I need to live righteously upon earth and to reign among the just in Heaven, meanwhile, in company with all faithful Christians throughout the world, I salute thee and acclaim thee as Queen of the most Holy Rosary: Queen of the most holy Rosary, pray for us.*

*O Mary, Heavenly Queen and mistress of all things created, who are invested by God with the fullness of power over all demons and over all and any power of the evil, in great distress I surrender myself completely to you.*

*O IMMACULATE CONCEPTION, BREAK IN ME ANY TEMPTATION. O CO- REDEMPTRIX WITH CHRIST, PURIFY ME OF ALL AND ANY TRACES OF SIN. O TERROR OF DEMONS, I IMPLORE YOU TO WIELD YOUR TREMENDOUS POWER OVER ANY FORCE OF EVIL WHICH WOULD DARE THREATEN ME.*

*Most powerful mistress, I implore you, do command any demon who is torturing me, discouraging me, troubling my mind, depriving me of all peace of heart, paralyzing me with fear, anguish and all kinds of ill-dispositions, or guiding me towards sin and vice, to prostrate themselves at your feet, in order to be subjected to punishment and humiliation to your satisfaction. I implore you, do command them to praise and to glorify the power you have over them, and prostrate at your feet, to confess that you are their Mistress. In order for me to gain entire freedom,  I totally, unconditionally and eternally consecrate my entire being to you, and with all the angels and saints I acknowledge and confess my faith in your unlimited and over whelming power over all demons and over all plan, schemes and works of evil.*

O MARY, powerful mistress of all souls, protect me.
O Mary, powerful mistress of all souls, deliver me.
O Mary, powerful mistress of all souls, rule over me and my life. 
O Mary, powerful mistress of all souls, rule over all darkness. Amen

facebook,"Hoe ziek en hypocriet zowel de NAVO als EU zijn, zie je ook in hoe ze zelfs hun eigen regels aan hun armyboots lappen: een land in conflict zou niet kunnen toetreden tot deze organisaties. EU politiek was altijd: geen wapens naar conflictgebieden en ban clustermunitie. En nu leveren ze miljarden aan wapens en zelfs verboden munitie, en het gebruik van uraniummunitie is plots helemaal niet meer schadelijk. Straks zijn we waarschijnlijk ook de enigen die het met uraniumstof vergiftigde graan nog importeren uit Oekra√Øne of wat daar nog van over is. Geen probleem toch, die uraniummunitie, kijk maar naar Novi Sad en Fallujah. Maar ja, beide organisaties zetten alles op alles om te voorkomen dat Rusland dit conflict dadelijk be√´indigd op haar voorwaarden, daar ze weten dat dat ook tot het uiteenvallen √©n marginalisatie van hun clubje zal leiden. Dus Rusland, het land met de meeste atoomkoppen en snelste raketten om die af te leveren moet verliezen, terwijl iedereen op zijn klompen aanvoelt dat Rusland niet zal verliezen, en zou het verliezen, dat het dan de hele wereld zou meeslepen in de nucleaire afgrond. Maar toch moeten de Westerse Elites blijven escaleren, willen ze overleven.... En raken we dus ondertussen door ons Oekra√Ønse kannonenvoer heen... de bodem is te zien, net als de oorlogsmoeheid, de verslagenheid en de wanhoop bij de Oekra√Øense soldaten, die als ze zich proberen over te geven, vaak door hun AZOV broeders en ander Nazigebroed in de rug worden geschoten. Het Russisch leger vecht ondertussen niet met spades, heeft geen electronica nodig uit wasmachines e.d. om hun raketten te laten vliegen, het is geen ongeregeld zooitje, zoals Westerse propaganda ons wilde doen geloven. Nee, het is inmiddels een professionele vechtmachine die haar gelijke niet kent, die al voor zo'n 100miljard(!) aan (groot deel Westerse superieure) wapens heeft vernietigd, en langzaam staat er een enorm leger klaar waarvan nog niet de helft is ingezet. Ook de Russische wapenindustrie produceert op zowat elk vlak een veelvoud aan spul vergeleken met het Westen. Voor elke Rus die sneuvelt, sneuvelen er 6 tot 10 Oekra√Øners(en buitenlandse huurlingen/contractors) De arme klootzakken die we voor ons karretje hebben gespannen sterven dus als vliegen, een onzinnige dood in een onzinnig gevecht in een strijd die al gestreden is: het moment van de start van de Russische operatie eind februari 2022, was het moment dat Westerse dominantie werd gebroken. Maar nu hoop ik maar dat we hier in het Westen onze elites/neocons op tijd stoppen voor het te laat is: een wereld zonder Rusland, gaat slechts een nucleaire winter tegenmoet!",,143,"{'like_count': 75, 'comment_count': 22, 'num_users': 4222}",Vrede met Rusland,,2023-10-06 10:34:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/272674072_10224305256570490_2224659948006558353_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hSEjH8b7pEgAX9pN2u4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCPnYN6ektih3sm2Rk-nsImCRIdwMS-ObWf1FsVjthskw&oe=655BABAC,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1607528562702027/permalink/6615417178579782,

A new case law regarding the Bill of Rights has surfaced and includes the following in it's ruling: 1. overturned law and states that if a statute is in conflict with the Bill then the Bill wins 2. the right to fair hearing as per 2 (e) of the Bill! THIS CASE LAW IS POST CHARTER: Have a read through the highlights below and please share! MacBain v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al., (1985) 62 N.R. 117 (FCA) **Civil Rights - Topic 8081** Canadian Bill of Rights - Powers of courts where statute conflicts with Canadian Bill of Rights - The Canadian Human Rights Commission found that a complaint was substantiated and under s. 39(1)(5) of the Canadian Human Rights Act appointed a Tribunal to inquire into the complaint and acted as prosecutor of the complaint before the Tribunal - The Federal Court of Appeal held that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias in violation of s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights and declared s. 39(1)(5) of the Canadian Human Rights Act inoperative in the situation - See paragraphs 36 to 39. **Civil Rights - Topic 8081** Canadian Bill of Rights - Powers of courts where statute conflicts with Canadian Bill of Rights - The Federal Court of Appeal held that a statute which offends the Canadian Bill of Rights should be declared inoperative in the situation, which restricts the inoperative effect to the facts and is not as drastic as declaring the statute void or invalid - See paragraphs 31 to 35. **Civil Rights - Topic 8303** Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - Effect of - On Canadian Bill of Rights - The Federal Court of Appeal held that the Canadian Bill of Rights continues in full force with the advent of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - See paragraphs 24 to 29. **Civil Rights - Topic 8348** Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - Application - Exceptions - Reasonable limits prescribed by law - The Federal Court of Appeal rejected a utilitarian approach to determining reasonable limits to Charter rights - See paragraph 22. This is not a magic bullet by any means, however, this is the BEST single piece of case law that the Bill is still operable, that 2(e) was upheld and that the Bill overturned law!

facebook,"ARTIKEL PILIHAN: MALAYSIAN POLICEMAN GOES ON A UN PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN SOUTH SUDAN UN peacekeepers play a critical role in fulfilling the UN peace operations to maintain international peace and security. Peacekeepers‚Äô tasks vary according to mandates from the UN Security Council. Each mandate is different according to the nature of conflicts and threats to peace. Some of the common responsibilities involve preventing outbreaks of conflict, stabilising conflict situations, assisting with the implementation of peace agreements, and assisting states to transition to stable governments through democratic principles. Most missions are in countries facing hardship where there are significant security risks and where there is likely to be a long road of recovery in rebuilding what had been lost due to conflict and displacement of people. There are currently 12 active peacekeeping operations across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. During my 19 years of service with the Royal Malaysia Police, I was fortunate to be entrusted with responsibilities ranging from intelligence to crime prevention and management. However, when the department advertised for expressions of interest for a peacekeeping tour of duty with United Nations Police (UNPOL), I thought it would be an opportunity to seek a fresh professional and international challenge.

facebook,"HOLY AND DIVINE LOVE MESSAGES FROM THE PAST (for us to reflect on today - October 6, 2023) April 19, 2009 Heaven Speaks to the Heart of the World (specifically - the path the world is taking) Midnight Service at the United Hearts Field - Feast of Divine Mercy (This message was given in multiple parts over several days.) Jesus is here as He is in the Divine Mercy Image; there is a huge Flame behind Him. He says: ""I am your Jesus, born Incarnate. I come to you tonight from the Will of the Eternal Father Whose Flame of Love you see behind Me."" ""My brothers and sisters, I come to you as your Merciful Jesus. Those who love Me understand My Mercy and My Love, which are one. These are the ones that allow My Mercy and My Love to shine through them into the world. These are the ones who understand the call of My Heart to repentance of each soul. I will refuse no one who turns to Me with a repentant heart."" ""Today the foundation of a one-world government has been laid through the global economic collapse which Satan has orchestrated. As this unfolds, remember that your free will remains intact. No one can dictate the affections of your heart. Live always in Holy Love. Remain calm; be at peace. If your heart is steeped in love of God and love of neighbor, you are safe, for I am with you."" ""Hope, indeed, springs eternal for those who place their trust in Me. See in all world events the coming of the Kingdom of the Divine Will of My Father. Believe in this Kingdom - the New Jerusalem - which is alive in hearts living in Holy Love."" ""Those who have made hatred into a 'religion' will destroy themselves. They cannot succeed, for Truth will be victorious. Holy Love is the Heart of Truth. In truth I tell you, it is now the hour of decision. Take up the weapons of prayer and sacrifice as I call together My army ** against evil. My victims of love are the officers in this spiritual army. I tell you, the battle against evil must be won in hearts before it is won in the world."" ""During these decisive and difficult times, it is important to realize that conflict and wars arise in hearts because of conflict with the Commandments of Love. God desires all of creation to be in harmony with His Divine Will. This is why He has created this apparition site and this Mission. The more that people accept and surrender to Holy Love, * the greater the graces poured out here. Therefore, with hearts that emulate Divine Mercy and Divine Love, make the Messages known."" ""My Mercy will never be depleted, but the dawn of My Divine Justice is at hand. Satan seeks to destroy all that is good and loving, using people and nature to accomplish his goals. Depend on Divine Mercy and Divine Love to see you through the worst of times. From My Love and My Mercy flows My Provision."" ""I invite you to realize that when the Holy Love in your heart is compromised, every virtue begins to erode. It is as if the roots of a great tree were Holy Love. The trunk would be humility; the blossoms on this great tree are the different virtues. The roots and the trunk (love and humility) must remain healthy for the whole tree to be healthy. In the spiritual life, Holy Love and Holy Humility feed and support all the other virtues. Therefore, if Holy Love erodes, faith and hope are weakened. If humility is compromised, the rest of the tree of virtues begins to wither."" ""Within each soul is this mystical tree of virtue; it gives life or else it withers and dies. In society this tree of virtue is necessary towards world peace. If it is ignored and not watered with Holy Trust, the world around the tree suffers. This is what leads to lack of peace in hearts."" ""You may wonder at My depiction of personal holiness as this tree of virtue. But I invite you to see that each soul's journey or growth in holiness affects the heart of the world, for the heart of the world is a composite of the hearts of all its citizenry. The tree of virtue in the heart of the world is drying up from lack of care. In its place is the tree of antipathy towards God and His Commandments. The roots of this tree are hatred; the trunk is arrogant pride; the blossoms are not blooms but rather spoiled fruit - each one opposing virtue. This tree is beginning to thrive, nourished by man's over-indulgent trust in himself - through self-love."" ""With a compassionate heart for the spiritual crisis in the heart of the world, realize that the tree of virtue stretches heavenward towards perfection in God's Will. On the other hand, the tree of antipathy towards God suffers from neglect and lack of care and takes on a countenance of death. Unless the gardener notices this poor tree, it will face a grim future."" ""This is why I have come here - to draw attention to the state of the heart of the world. My plea is urgent. Nourish your hearts with the food of virtue. Do not be motivated by self-love, but by love of God and neighbor. This is what will redirect the future of the world.

facebook,"James Cleverly says Falklands are British as Argentina ends deal üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß The UK has insisted the Falkland Islands are British after Argentina broke a co-operation deal and pushed for talks on the islands' sovereignty. In 2016, both sides agreed to disagree on the sovereignty of the Falklands in favour of improved relations. Argentina pulled out of the pact this week and informed UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly. The Falkland Islands were subject to a bloody war in 1982 when Argentina tried to stake a territorial claim. Veterans' Falklands trip marks 40 years since war In response, Mr Cleverly tweeted: ""The Falkland Islands are British. ""Islanders have the right to decide their own future - they have chosen to remain a self-governing UK Overseas Territory."" The 2016 agreement between Argentina and the UK pledged to ""improve co-operation on South Atlantic issues of mutual interests"". Mr Cleverly was informed about the decision by his Argentinean counterpart Santiago Cafiero when the pair met at the G20 summit in India earlier this week. Mr Cafier called for talks on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, known in Argentina as the Malvinas. The UK's minister for the Americas, David Rutley, said it was a ""disappointing decision"" after he had had a ""constructive visit"" to Buenos Aires. ""Argentina has chosen to step away from an agreement that has brought comfort to the families of those who died in the 1982 conflict,"" he said. The Falkland Islands are a British overseas territory in the south-west Atlantic Ocean. Argentina has long claimed sovereignty over the islands. Argentina invaded in 1982 in a bid to reclaim sovereignty and said it had inherited the Falkland Islands from Spain in the 1800s. A brief but bitter war lasting 74 days followed - with 655 Argentinian, 255 British and three Falkland deaths - before British forces regained control on 14 June 1982.",,128,"{'like_count': 70, 'comment_count': 41, 'num_users': 295601}",The British Falkland Islands & British Military,,2023-10-06 19:08:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352234624_819542726358713_999076251103151864_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=27GK6f5PRAkAX-3Pb1-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAULlTCxRSBQWc_vtr_Fwwbe6rLZwoen-rEPfNycs0LLg&oe=655AB0B6,https://www.facebook.com/100069531992001/posts/620982993562762,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/13558644408493107338?url=https%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fnews%2F1024%2Fbranded_news%2FC9ED%2Fproduction%2F_128839615_gettyimages-1246895631.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=co.uk&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbEmpQ8zTYbwDk25LmS_N1FbgKvoAO3tTgluKmRmmeku0Q&oe=65222CF6

On October 5, 2023, at approximately 4:15 p.m., Sheriff‚Äôs deputies were dispatched to the Tiger Express for a gunshot victim. When they arrived, they found the man suffering from a gunshot wound to his thigh.

Both vehicles pulled into the Tiger Express gas station where a verbal argument ensued. The argument then escalated to Williams shooting the victim. Deputies quickly identified Williams as the person responsible for the shooting. He was located on Dulamo Road on Saint Helena Island shortly after 5:00 p.m. where he was detained.

facebook,"From Passive to Assertive: Empowering Autistic Women Many autistic individuals often find themselves facing unique challenges in their interpersonal relationships. This can lead to feelings of victimisation and, in some cases, even exploitation. In a recent study by Sarah Bargiela and colleagues (2016), participants shared their experiences, shedding light on the journey from passivity to assertiveness and the obstacles they encountered along the way. ** Please note that this post includes references to sexual abuse, which may be distressing to some readers; if you find such content distressing, please consider refraining from reading further. ** Passivity and Its Consequences"" Participants frequently linked their perceived passivity to their autism, highlighting how it had led to unhealthy relationships and high-risk situations. One participant expressed the pressure she felt to conform, stating, ""I almost feel pressured by society to do it because you get told this is what is expected of you to make you be a good girlfriend, and you think, if I don't do it, then I am not fulfilling my duties."" This struggle to please and appease others often left them feeling trapped. Avoiding conflict was another common theme among participants. For many, any form of verbal disagreement was seen as 'having a fight.' This avoidance sometimes resulted in over-assertiveness, leading to damage in their friendships. As one participant put it, ""When it finally comes out, I can be a bit too blunt."" However, there were exceptions, with some women refusing to appease when they knew something was wrong. A Shocking Incidence of Sexual Abuse"" Disturbingly, nine out of fourteen participants reported instances of sexual abuse. Half of these accounts occurred within relationships, where young women felt obliged or ""gradually being pestered"" into sexual activities. Arguments often escalated into sexual encounters, even when they didn't want to engage. Three young women reported being raped by individuals they didn't know, with one particularly distressing case involving grooming by a peer on behalf of three older men. Several factors contributed to these situations, including social mimicry, difficulty in reading others' intentions, social isolation during adolescence, and a desperate desire for acceptance. Their difficulties in reading people's intentions and understanding social rules left them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. - ""I kept trying to break up with him, and whenever I did, he would say I didn‚Äôt know my own feelings...I felt so trapped."" The women spoke of feeling obligated or gradually coerced into sexual activity, often due to societal expectations placed upon them. As one participant commented, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs potential for you copying a guy‚Äôs flirtatious behaviour without realising that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù Learning to be Assertive: Despite narratives of passivity and accounts of abuse, many women also shared stories of personal growth and an increase in their ability to be assertive. They learned to read others' intentions better, which empowered them to leave uncomfortable situations. Some had received guidance, such as ""a guide to being assertive"" from a counsellor or skills acquired through their jobs. Four women discussed how their diagnosis of autism had become a tool for confidence in asserting their opinions. They no longer felt obligated to provide explanations, and simply saying 'no' became an option. This newfound assertiveness was a testament to their resilience and self-advocacy. Raising Awareness: Protecting Vulnerable Autistic Women: The stories shared by these young women highlight a critical issue that practitioners and society as a whole must address: the high vulnerability and shockingly high rates of sexual abuse among autistic women. It is imperative that professionals in the fields of healthcare, psychology, education, and social work, as well as law enforcement agencies, recognise and respond to the unique challenges faced by autistic women. 1. Education and Training: Practitioners need to undergo specialised training to understand the intricacies of autism, particularly in the context of gender-specific challenges. This includes recognising the signs of abuse and understanding how the characteristics of autism may contribute to a higher risk of victimisation. 2. Trauma-Informed Care: Practitioners should adopt trauma-informed care approaches when working with autistic women who have experienced sexual abuse. Understanding the potential trauma and its effects on mental health is crucial for providing effective support and therapy. 3. Preventative Education: Schools and educational institutions should incorporate comprehensive sex education programs that are adapted to the needs of autistic students. These programs should focus not only on biological aspects but also on relationship dynamics, boundaries, and consent. 4.

facebook,"The world is desperately short on teachers, with 44 million more teachers needed to cover every child by 2030, says a new UNESCO report. Parts of Africa account for one-third of the shortfall. Teachers are leaving the profession twice as often as they were in 2015. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ Across parts of Africa, over 13,000 schools closed over the last four years because of conflict and insecurity, say NGOs ‚Äì including countries like Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Niger ‚Äì affecting over 2.5 million children. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ One in five children in southern, western and eastern Africa are not in school. The countries with the highest rates of uneducated children also tend to have the highest levels of poverty. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ Worldwide, COVID has also intensified gendered violence and economic disparities between men and women. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ Lack of school access was a problem before the pandemic, with up to 60 million children out of school. Barriers to education, including pandemic closures, unaffordability and gender discrimination, were linked to higher risk of child labor and child marriage. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ Over half of girls who dropped out of school during the pandemic in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania reported pregnancies, according to UN Women. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ In Africa, most teaching vacancies are for entirely new positions, says UNESCO.

facebook,"Despite our ignorance about what is really going on during a conflict situation between two people or groups of people, we only draw to us what is necessary and needed in order to complete our journey back home, or, to say it better, to create a new world that is free of the binding influence of duality. To be able to enter the world of unconditional love, freedom, and non-judgment (the kingdom of heaven) we first needed to go through everything that could feel fearful and restrictive. We all needed to judge others so that we would know how it feels to be judged in turn, according to the laws of karma. Not liking someone is painful to our heart and a restriction to the oneness that we are. Our Higher Self has no such notions of dislike or separation; it naturally feels one with the person with which our ego has difficulties. Through karma, we are attached to one another, positively ‚Äòstuck‚Äô with this person until our human resistance melts down and disappears. Karma‚Äôs only role is to bring back to us the awareness of oneness.

Tell me I'm not alone - when you expect to be in the proximity of someone you admire/respect/fangirl over/whatever, you think about what you would say to them if you had the opportunity to interact. What would you say if you had 10 seconds to tell someone important about something that is important to you? Well this project is a direct result of being told over and over again in her politics chats the best thing we can do to change things is to speak and take up oxygen. When I finally got motivated to do that, I had to really evaluate what my barriers were to doing it and what I could do to get beyond them. Barriers included: Fear of conflict Introvert - I don't talk to people much The lack of time, energy, money, physical ability Feeling like what I say will never be heard, so why bother If those were my barriers, I assumed they were barriers for others as well. So I tried to come up with a way of communicating that got around all those barriers that I could provide for me and people like me. That's what I would say I guess. How would you describe this project? Are there any barriers that hold you back that I might be able to help with?",,121,"{'like_count': 60, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 1832}",Liberal Rocks,,2023-10-06 01:40:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/322732639_1303619877087285_7301481819372042772_n.jpg?stp=c31.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yOpBxNNk7P8AX9Qfa9j&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDKKYpx2bvSAy66JGOyo8iinzfoHmXfiarMoKvIudOlxQ&oe=655A05CB,https://www.facebook.com/groups/498484771926755/permalink/852166693225226,

""The press situation is spiraling out of control. Despite the gates being locked,they're showing no signs to relent"" Felix urgently reported to Azrael, whose normally composed face was now etched with concern. "" We need to find a way to shoo them away without adding fuel to the rampant speculations going around. We can't let them dig any deeper"" Azrael replied. Their core identities was something they had to protect from the knowledge of humans as getting it exposed would mean unnecessary chaos for both sides of humanity. Human were always poky and nosey with things they didn't know about,they carried insatiable curiosity for the unknown, often reacting with either unwarranted fear or an intrusive desire for elimination. If their true selves were revealed it would undoubtedly lead to relentless probing by scientists and the perilous prospect of human-hybrid conflict and even though they could easily win a waged war between them and humans,it was better to avoid the situation all together. "" What if we stage a harmless but distracting event? Something that will pique their interest and make them want to leave the estate,at least for now"" Felix suggested, ""We could...."" ""Open the gates and let them in"" The sudden presence of someone else inside the large parlour drew both men's attention to the man they hadn't expected to see out of that room any time soon,caught off guard,they watched as he made his way down from the stairs. Dressed in a crisp and professional work attire, with his hair neatly combed, although still bearing a hint of ruffled charm, he exuded the quintessential appearance of a seasoned businessman, meticulously put together from head to toe. The click of his fine leather shoes echoed against the marble flooring as he approached both beta and gamma, giving out his instructions. However, his words caused them to frown and they both stared at the man like he was crazy or had suddenly lost his mind "" Alpha, with all due respect,..."" Azrael began "" we've been trying to keep them out for safety causes, Bringing them in now would be...rather not a wise choice."" ""I said open-the-gates,and-let-them-in"" His voice was deep and commanding,brooking no further argument. Both gamma and beta exchanged incredulous glances,yet,given no choice,they could only comply. . . √ó√ó√ó Amid the grandeur of his lavish mansion, Dorian extended a gracious welcome to the press, ensuring each journalist and reporter was meticulously accommodated with precise. He took his seat on a lone couch, one leg gracefully crossed over the other, his Italian leather shoes gleaming beneath the ambient chandeliers which hung high by the ceiling. His hands,adorned with a diamond watch that exuded of luxury, rested serenely against the arm rest. The cameras and phones set up,were focused and intent on capturing every movement made from him. As he began to speak, his voice resonated with an air of authority, and his poised demeanor demanded the rapt attention of all present, leaving an indelible impression of elegance and power. "" Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate your presence here today. I would like to address the recent news that has been circulating about me being a supernatural being,and I hope to assure you all,that these claims are entirely false"" ""Mr Skendore,it has been observed you've been notably silent since the news surfaced. Can you explain your reasons for not addressing this issue sooner?"" A female reporter questioned,her note pad tightly in her grip as she anticipated a response from the man "" Thank you for your question.."" Dorian began with a warm smile ""I would like to to clarify that my initial silence was not intended to perpetuate any mystery or misinformation. Rather, it was a response to the shock and confusion caused by these unfounded and sudden claims."" ""But Mr Skendore, some have criticized your lack of response as an act of avoidance. How do you respond to those who feel you should have spoken out or rejected the claims earlier?"" Another reporter,inquired,and calmly,Dorian began "" I understand those concerns,..My decision to remain silent was based on advice from my legal team and PR advisors. We wanted to ensure that our responses were well-informed and comprehensive, as addressing such sensitive allegations requires careful consideration."" "" Can you tell us what prompted you to finally break your silence today Mr Skendore"" An older reporter asked "" Of course..""

Mark originally came to us in the fall of 2021 after he was saved from euthanasia at an overcrowded Texas shelter. Mark doesn‚Äôt let his unfortunate upbringing keep him down. He is full of personality and always up for a good time! We thought Mark found his forever home, but unfortunately due to some conflict between Mark and the other dog in the home, it was decided for everyone‚Äôs safety that Mark find a new place to call home. Because of this, we feel Mark would do best in a home as an only pet. He hasn‚Äôt been exposed to any feline friends, but because of his high prey drive to small critters, he would not be a good candidate for a family with cats. Mark is fully potty trained and does well in his crate. He has some FOMO when his four legged friends would leave for a walk and would vocalize his annoyance. Otherwise, Mark is known to seek his crate out anytime he wants to take a nap, and does great while his family is at work. Mark appreciates a good fetch session, and would thrive with someone who can fulfill him both physically and mentally. He is good blend of energy and chill. When Mark has gotten his energy out, he is always down for a cuddle session. Mark is looking for a foster/adopter who can provide him with the structure and consistency he needs to be the best boy possible. He is working on his leash manners and not being so excited when meeting her people. Because of his jumping we think a home with older children or none at all would be best for him. Currently he knows his name, sit and kennel up. He is a smart guy, and is ready to learn! There is so much to love about Mark, and he would be grateful to find someone who is willing to open their heart and home to him. Mark is available for foster or adoption! http://misfitmuttsdogrescue.com/adoption/ http://misfitmuttsdogrescue.com/foster/ E-mail us at misfitmuttsdogrescue@gmail.com with any questions!",,118,"{'like_count': 34, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 19405}",Misfit Mutts Dog Rescue,,2023-10-06 01:32:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/276250452_338457064980591_8022660194325862199_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=r5BxfaTpJY8AX-OIfb_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAzlXT47vf6VWmAb-5QdDy6f7b9znhKykLmFdUuS5uEhg&oe=655B6896,https://www.facebook.com/100064489014696/posts/713920467434247,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387045808_713919560767671_4515340416165297273_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nE_5D0B0XWgAX_oGYp_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCuijiOVcMM9acYa9TvdK52ynZsgRMqB3VTfvp8XiJ9Sw&oe=654974C9

facebook,"MRS-1 (Military Rail Switcher-1) Foreign Service Number: 1811 This was one of thirteen locomotives built by the General Motors Company for the U.S. Army in 1952-53, before the contract was taken over by the American Locomotive Company (ALCo)-General Electric, which produced a further eighty-three. It has six coupled driving wheels, with no leading or trailing wheels, thus referred to as a 0-6-6-0. The diesel-electric locomotive proved to be more efficient than the steam locomotive, in that it was able to convert fuel into energy more efficiently and the need to make frequent stops to refuel was virtually eliminated. Previous experience with operating locomotives in different counties proved to be a challenge for the Army, which took that into account when designing this model. Differing track gauges, couplings, braking systems and truck designs created obstacles when operating American locomotives overseas. The design process behind the MRS-1 was to build a locomotive that could operate on any particular country‚Äôs rail network and be able to use that country‚Äôs own rolling stock. Locomotive #1811 was used in Korea from 1952-54 during the latter part of the Korean Conflict. After the cease fire, it and most of the other locomotives were kept as strategic reserve until the 1970s when they began to be sold or sent to military bases for local use. Locomotive #1811 was last used in at Sunny Point, NC, in 1991 during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm.",,115,"{'like_count': 96, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 7975}",U.S. Army Transportation Museum,,2023-10-06 11:00:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/391697077_711704704324178_1420464989472017455_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GnFZd3bmcaYAX_piavk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB7QP92qgcYkjRGvTCSMOGma4prngTeTHrAenzZSgRKrg&oe=655B9BA7,https://www.facebook.com/100064539648714/posts/708305994664049,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/381013748_704530905041558_7076193484414546509_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xJR_kgg1MnAAX8JKUyY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA2xNZX9suX1mxz-ncp5T4O8_RBws_0WlDeKcUdiKwZeQ&oe=655A76F5
facebook,"Elder's Meditation of the Day - Oct 6 ""Lots of people hardly ever feel real soil under their feet, see plants grow except in flower pots, or get far enough beyond the street light to catch the enchantment of a night sky studded with stars. When people live far from scenes of the Great Spirit's making, it's easy for them to forget His laws."" --Tatanga Mani (Walking Buffalo), STONEY Nature is life's greatest teacher. The natural laws are hidden in nature. Hidden are solutions to everyday problems such as; conflict resolution, how to forgive, lessons about differences, how to manage organizations, how to think. Hidden are feelings. You can look at something and you will feel it. At night, have you ever looked at the sky when there are no clouds? As you look at all the stars, your heart will become very joyful. You will walk away feeling joyful and peaceful. We need to visit nature so we can see and feel these things.

facebook,"FIRST VOYAGE TO THE SOLOMON ISLANDS (1567-1569). The discovery by √Ålvaro de Menda√±a.

The two ships, the 200-ton Los Reyes (the Capitana or flagship) and the 140-ton Todos Santos (the Almiranta or secondary ship) sailed from Callao, in Peru on 20 November 1567, with about 150 sailors, soldiers and priests on board in search of Terra Australis, an imaginary continent with origins in classical Greece that used to appear on European maps from the 15th century until the 18th century

After sighting a small island in mid January (probably Nui in what is now Tuvalu), a significant body of land was sighted on 7 February 1568. It was Santa Isabel Island, where they landed several days later. The expedition had discovered the Solomon Islands which they named Islas Salomon. The Spanish immediately came into contact with Solomon Islanders who were later found to be cannibals, though at first the relationship was cordial. However, the Spanish expedition's need for fresh food and water quickly led to tension and conflict as the islanders were unable to provide supplies after some time.  The real prizes were pigs, desperately needed by the Spanish, which were also important to the local people's economy.  The Spanish were horrified to find the islanders were cannibals when they were offered ""a quarter of a boy with the arm and hand"" which the islanders urged Menda√±a to eat.

After building a small brigantine, the surrounding islands of Malaita, Guadalcanal, Makira (which was named San Cristobal) and Choiseul Island were explored. However, the attempts to barter for food led to the same cycle of friendly welcome, misunderstandings, sullen retreats, occasional reconciliations, robberies and violent retaliation.  Finally, at a council meeting of captains, pilots, soldiers and sailors on 7 August 1568, the decision was made to return to Peru. Menda√±a had wanted to sail further south, while Sarmiento de Gamboa and several soldiers unsuccessfully urged the establishment of a colony.

The two ships sailed north then east, passing the Marshall Islands and Wake Island, before reaching the Mexican coast in late January 1569. It was a long and difficult voyage, with numerous deaths from scurvy.

Inlove na ako sa kaibigan ko. Itago niyo nalang po ako sa pangalang Nico, 25 yrs old mga papa. Ang hirap pala itago ang tunay na nararamdaman mo sa kabigan mo. Matagal na kaming magka kilala. Naging mag bestfriends na din kami. Halos araw araw magkasama dahil magkakilala din ang pamilya naming dalawa. Ang hirap pigilan mga papa. Lagi kasi siya andiyan lalo na pag down na down ako. Siya lagi ang maaasahan ko mga papa. Takot akong umamin baka maging awkward ang lahat. Di ko din alam ang gagawin ko pag nalaman ito ng mga family niya. Kailangan ko ba itigil ang nararamdaman ko para sa kanya o ipaglalaban ko ang sinisigaw ng puso ko? Ang tinutukoy kong kaibigan mga kabarangay ay ang kaibigan kong lalaki na itago niyo nalang po sa pangalang Ron. Ang bestfriend kong lalaki since elementary. Mga papa hindi ko naman ito nararamdaman dati sa bestfriend ko. Habang nag kaka edad po kasi kami mas nagiging malakas po ang samahan namin. Tapos ayaw ko din na magbago ang turingan namin sa isa't isa. Sobrang daming conflict mga papa kapag lumabas ito. Lalo na po hindi ko alam kung matatanggap ako ng parents ko.

facebook,"Why is the FEAST of the OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY, on every October 7th? 
..... The story of the  VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY at the Battle of Lepanto, on OCTOBER  7, 1571.

IN TIMES OF ACUTE DANGER AND HARDSHIP, WE MUST ALWAYS FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD AND TURN TO THE RECITATION OF HER HOLY ROSARY. The Battle of Lepanto is a great lesson of confidence for us today. 

When Saint Pius V became Pope, Christendom faced the perils perhaps unequaled in its history of continual conflict with the violent followers of Mohammed. All the information and intelligence that Pope Pius V had been gathering indicated that the Ottoman juggernaut was about to roll across the Mediterranean and adjacent lands, spearheaded by the Turkish fleet, with Italy and Rome as one of its target. (The Ottoman Empire is also historically known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire)

Only Spain and Venice had the resources to resist, and they hated each other along with deep mistrust. Yet Saint Pius ‚Äî calling down divine grace as only a man of prayer could ‚Äî forged an alliance with them as the core of an organized fleet of over 200 galleys. With his considerable tact and diplomatic skills, he not only kept them unified, but he convinced them to attack the enveloping menace.

The Archbishop of Mexico had an exact copy of the HOLY IMAGE OF THE LADY OF GUADALUPE sent to King Philip II, who in turn gave it to Andrea Doria, one of the three principal admirals of the fleet, who placed it in his cabin. When the Armada went from file to line abreast and attacked on the morning of OCTOBER 7, 1571 the blue standard of OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE was also flying from the masthead of Don Juan‚Äôs flagship. 

Pope Pius V, a Dominican prelate before becoming a Pope, did what Catholics have always done in times of acute danger: FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD. As a follower of Saint Dominic, HE KNEW THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF IMPLORING HER HELP WAS THROUGH THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY. He ordered all monasteries and convents in Rome to increase their prayers for the impending battle and organized ROSARY PROCESSIONS in which he, as sick as he was, participated. OUR LADY‚ÄôS PRESENCE THAT DAY WAS MORE ACUTELY FELT THROUGH THE HOLY ROSARY.

As the Christian fleet sailed toward the great clash, MASS WAS CELEBRATED AND THE ROSARY RECITED DAILY ON EACH VESSEL‚Ä¶.. THIS HEARTFELT REQUEST FOR DIVINE ASSISTANCE RESULTED IN A CRUSHING DEFEAT OF THE OTTOMANS AT LEPANTO THAT ENDED THEIR DOMINANCE AND CRUELTY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. OCTOBER 7, 1571, WAS THE VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY, EVEN IF THE CHRISTIAN FLEET WAS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE OTTOMAN FLEET.

TO CELEBRATE OUR LADY‚ÄôS INTERCESSION AND VICTORY, THE CHURCH HAS DESIGNATED OCTOBER 7 AS THE FEAST OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY. Similar acknowledgement to the Blessed Virgin‚Äôs intercession through the Rosary were made when John Sobieski forced the Turks to lift the Siege of Vienna in 1683 and after the victory of Prince Eugene of Savoy at Temesvar in his successful campaign to remove the Ottomans from Europe in the next century.",,103,"{'like_count': 48, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 348582}",OUR LADY OF FATIMA,,2023-10-06 15:40:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/279972953_2175763919266859_3517823123217404151_n.jpg?stp=c23.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=oFao_Q-7cjsAX_PnrI9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBW481rBX0rljqqjgzUs-_-1xig6m80u0212EbTY-YjVg&oe=655AA689,https://www.facebook.com/groups/252633465845405/permalink/1027461088362635,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386786913_6622074261203396_5928534652368284138_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=Qg0P94W8ylIAX9sFoJO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCNTKI1pWNU0ePVQvu8_kfkzFpLjoa5fBVRrQVBT5-K3g&oe=6524553F

I experience peace in my inner world. There is no restlessness or rush to do things as it used to happen in the past. Inner dialogue has considerably reduced.

Thoughts used to trouble me, now I can easily see them come and go. Earlier I used to struggle with my thoughts. I can now be observant of my suffering or conflict and dissolve them with my awareness and prayer. There is no disturbance within.

Earlier when a troublesome event happened, I used to feel a lot of stress and tension. Body used to go into struggle mode. Now it feels light and I am able to quickly bring my inner turmoil into calmness.

If some hurts me now, I can see the hurt within me and in 10 minutes it is gone. If something major happens, I could dissolve it in an hour. 

I can easily go about my everyday work without conflict. 
I used to eat mechanically, now I eat with total awareness. Concentration has increased. 

I know my journey of Enlightenment has just begun and there is a lot Sri Amma Bhagavan has to offer me in the path ahead. So grateful for all Your timeless blessings.

facebook,"I'm wondering, what war in the history of Battletech would have the most space battles? Better yet, is there any conflict that was fought almost ***entirely*** in the void, as in the major battles were won in space and the ground combat was a smaller, less important part of the conflict? I literally can't get enough of space battles in sci-fi. Rogue One is my favourite Star Wars movie and the space part of the Battle of Scarif is the best part of the film imo, Homeworld 1 and Homeworld Emergence/Cataclysm are some of my most played video games, Battlefleet Gothic is my most played tabletop game by far (closely followed by BattleTech), so on and so forth, I'm sure you get the picture. Now I know BattleTech is a game about big, stompy, awesome robots and I'm aware of the kinda dumb piece of the lore that says everyone ""forgot"" how to make WarShips since ROM killed all the people that knew how to build 'em, but I'm still curious about this part of the lore. If I had to take a guess, I would assume the war with the most space battles would be either the Reunification War or the Amaris Civil War. During the Jihad there were ***a lot*** of space battles and it's said that a great number of these were won by boarding actions that saw numerous ships captured by all sides of the conflict, but no navy in that era even came close matching the size of the truly massive SLDF navy of the Star League era. Would I be right in assuming that the Star League Civil War or Reunification War had the most ship battles? I am not asking about a single battle, like the liberation of Terra, I mean like a full war fought almost entirely in the void of space/a conflict filled with space battles :)",,102,"{'like_count': 62, 'comment_count': 33, 'num_users': 21213}",Everything Battletech,,2023-10-06 15:32:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/383416957_874509317411554_2288616869748196234_n.png?stp=c25.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=28AhTYyFPgsAX_KXvr_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCJRIl1W5ry5ERJcANfvceuEDKHlInfHKe1jH5KWG1LnA&oe=655B439B,https://www.facebook.com/groups/845406525887279/permalink/1718165198611403,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387200993_1766562637090923_6445850996588627580_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=m2D8nB28Ne0AX_j3M1x&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDKL9eWxY-iUW34bvFwebRYPT6hWZQjGcpMo_bw0u9EJA&oe=65250AC3
facebook,"It is with heavy hearts that we share the passing of Yogi, the male Brown Bear. He was a wild born bear who came to the Zoo in 1994 from Yellowstone National Park. He was brought here due to repeated human area conflict and would have been euthanized if no suitable placement was found.

Born in 1992, Yogi far exceeded his life expectancy and over the years, he developed arthritis. The John Ball Zoo vet team prescribed him medications to ease the pain. As time passed, Yogi began experiencing severe mobility issues and was recently immobilized to examine the extremity of his arthritis. The ability to regain control of Yogi's discomfort was no longer a realistic solution.

Yogi was a gentle giant. Keepers Jackie explains Yogi as an absolute joy to work with. ""Yogi's favorite day of the week was bone day. He would pass up his dinner and any sweet snack we had for him, and he would be busy chewing until all the meat was gone.""

In honor of Yogi, we will be hosting a, ""Teddy Bear,"" drive. Animal care supervisor, Jaime, worked with Yogi for 13 years. ""With such a large impact on our community, and especially on his animal care team, I really wanted to find a meaningful way to celebrate such a special bear.""

Jaime wanted to create a way to carry on Yogi's lasting connection he made with guests. ""A ""Teddy Bear"" drive would be the perfect way to remember him and provide for kids who need a buddy! Please help us gather a small army of Yogi bears over the next two weeks to bring to the kids at Helen Devos Children's Hospital.""

facebook,"We would like to issue a statement about the drama that happened earlier this week. When we originally posted the contest photos for our Friday the 13th Flash, we included several images found on Pinterest that were titled ""Friday the 13th flash tattoos"" among the photos. Friday the 13th is a tattoo industry holiday where spooky images, often including the numbers 13 and 31, and flash is circulated all over the internet. Any shop you find having these sales is using similar if not identical images for this popular holiday. A particular artist, in another state, saw our 28 pages of flash and immediately started accusing us of ""Stealing"" her artwork. Before the post had even been up for 10 minutes she had rallied people to trash talk us and leave us bad reviews. Then we removed the entire post to avoid conflict but she continued to harass us. At this point we still didn't know which sheet was ""stolen"" so we were unable to investigate properly, without proper investigation to determine if we were really in the wrong, we explained that we would continue sell any flash posted, as none of it was copyrighted or trademarked with watermarks prohibiting us from doing so. After several hours of harassment we finally discovered the flash sheet in question. It was a lucky rabbits foot sheet that we found online, like many others. This artist was upset that she had not been tagged in the post giving her credit for her $13 flash. If the sheet in question was actually her artwork, Her feelings were valid but her behavior was not necessary, especially since we removed it immediately. Upon investigating the artist's social media pages, we discovered that most of the flash she used is copyright images and images found to be circulated all over the internet. A simple reverse google search pointed out that NONE of it was original, all of it was the same flash sheets that we've all been using for years. She has never tagged the original artists, which was her main complaint about us, nor has she said the her posts ""not my art, would like to duplicate this"" she claims it all as her own. After all of you came together for us, leaving reviews and comments, as she had done, the artist saw that she was in the wrong and issued a public apology. The owner of the shop addressed it as well and admitted that it was not her original ideas. These apologies have since been taken down but we have them saved as screenshots. Thank you to our followers for understanding that ""Theft"" was never the intention, we used several sheets we found on Pinterest, that are coincidentally the same sheets the shop in another state had posted. They were not watermarked images, and they were amongst other circulated Friday 13th flash sheets. In the tattoo industry, Friday the 13th flash gets circulated world wide. Tattoo flash is meant to be duplicated, any flash that is custom has watermarks to avoid being ""stolen"". This particular shop did exactly what we were accused of doing, which was sharing flash and tattoos that were not original. In fact, we avoid posting our original artwork because our flash has been taken in the past, rather than being upset and rallying against them we felt flattered that they liked our work and that we reached so far for them to duplicate it! The highest compliment you can get, is someone duplicating your job well done. Many people do not agree with us reusing flash. Many of those who said we ""lost"" a paying customer over this are those who have personally brought in Pinterest images and wanted them tattooed on themselves or w people who only come in when we have $13 tattoos! Much of the flash you have tattooed on you is duplicated stuff you found on the internet. Very rarely are we given the opportunity to produce ""original"" tattoos. But when we do, our artists knock it out of the park! So remember, if you really want to support an artist, getting their personal custom artwork is a great way to start, rather than bringing in stuff you found on the Internet. ü§∑ we will tattoo it regardless, it's what you want after all. Since the drama is over and the artist has apologized for her inappropriate behavior, we have reposted our flash. We only included the sheets put together by the artists in our shop with popular images we know to be Friday the 13th favorites. We will be tattooing from over 30 sheets of flash this year, including several industry favorites, but only the contest sheets are up to be voted on as we held a contest for the apprentices and need accurate voting results to determine a winner.

The Sabbath is much more so than any other day because it holds in its fold immense blessings and opportunities for reborn. So, this is our prayer this Sabbath: ‚ÄúO HaShem, Thou art our God, we will exalt Thee, we will praise Thy name, for Thou hast done wonderful things; even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.‚Äù (Isaiah 25:1). As we keep the Shabbat, we mustn‚Äôt fail to recount His enduring goodness, for keeping us safe, alive, and well in these very turbulent and virus beleaguered times. We also include the fervent prayer that God will, in His compassionate mercy, heal the world and bring an end to every pestilence, pandemic, conflict and war. Let us therefore keep from defiling the Shabbat and remember that more than we have kept the Shabbat, the SHABBAT has kept us as a people, together, and safe from annihilation. May HASHEM, the Eternal One, blessed is He, grant that we experience the limitless joy of the holy Shabbat and through it, bring peace to our borders and shower His blessings upon our leaders that they may lead the nation(s) in righteousness, with equity and justice. Amen. #shabbatblessingsüôèüèæüïäüòá ‚ÄúBaruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haolam, shehecheyanu v'kiy'manu v'higianu laz'man hazeh.‚Äù (""Praise to You, Adonai our God, Sovereign of the universe, for giving us life, for sustaining us, and for enabling us to reach this season."")

facebook,"7 scandaluri care au marcat istoria premiilor Nobel Premiile Nobel au fost decernate pentru prima oarƒÉ √Æn 1901 »ôi de atunci au devenit una dintre cele mai prestigioase distinc»õii din lume. Oricine prime»ôte acest premiu dob√¢nde»ôte imediat faimƒÉ »ôi bani, iar munca »ôi ideile sale sunt creditate cu o √Æncredere enormƒÉ, la scarƒÉ planetarƒÉ. √énsƒÉ, cu toatƒÉ pompa care le √ÆnconjoarƒÉ, aceste premii nu au fost ocolite de scandaluri. Gafele, omisiunile, laurea»õii √Ændoielnici »ôi conflictele de interese se numƒÉrƒÉ printre controversele legate de premiile Nobel. √én acest articol √Æ»õi prezentƒÉm c√¢teva dintre aceste cazuri, care ar fi demne de rubricile tabloide, dacƒÉ nu ar fi vorba de un subiect at√¢t de serios. Controversele au √Ænceput chiar cu fondatorul acestor premii, Alfred Bernhard Nobel. Ca inventator al dinamitei »ôi al altor explozibili, Alfred Nobel nu avea cea mai bunƒÉ imagine publicƒÉ. De fapt, Nobel era at√¢t de dispre»õuit √Ænc√¢t, atunci c√¢nd fratele sƒÉu a murit, un ziar francez l-a confundat cu Alfred »ôi a folosit urmƒÉtorul titlu: ‚ÄûNegustorul mor»õii a murit‚Äù. Apoi, articolul relata cƒÉ omul de »ôtiin»õƒÉ ‚Äûs-a √ÆmbogƒÉ»õit gƒÉsind modalitƒÉ»õi de a ucide mai mul»õi oameni mai repede dec√¢t oric√¢nd √Ænainte‚Äù. Acest epitaf prematur l-a motivat pe Nobel sƒÉ creeze premiile care √Æi poartƒÉ numele, pentru a lƒÉsa o mo»ôtenire pozitivƒÉ. P√¢nƒÉ √Æn 2014, 864 de oameni »ôi 25 de organiza»õii primiserƒÉ Nobelul. Dintre laurea»õi, doar 47 erau femei, de aceea comitetul de acordare a premiilor a fost acuzat cƒÉ ignorƒÉ femeile. Una dintre cele mai cunoscute scƒÉpƒÉri ale comisiei o are √Æn centru pe Jocelyn Bell Burnell. Bell Burnell este cea care a descoperit pulsarii, √Æn 1967, »ôi a publicat o lucrare √ÆmpreunƒÉ cu √ÆndrumƒÉtorul ei, Antony Hewish. Numai cƒÉ pentru descoperire au fost premia»õi doar Hewish »ôi un alt coleg de-al femeii, Martin Ryle. Practic, lui Jocelya Bell Burnell i-au fost ‚Äûfurate‚Äù meritele acestei descoperiri. Cel mai controversat premiu Nobel este, probabil, cel pentru pace. Mul»õi dintre cei care l-au primit au fost critica»õi pentru comportamente care nu promoveazƒÉ pacea, dimpotrivƒÉ. Printre cele mai notabile exemple se numƒÉrƒÉ liderul Organiza»õiei de Eliberare a Palestinei (OLP), Yasser Arafat. √én 1994, acesta a √ÆmpƒÉr»õit premiul cu israelienii Yitzhak Rabin »ôi Shimon Peres pentru munca lor legatƒÉ de Acordul de la Oslo, parte integrantƒÉ a procesului de pace dintre Palestina »ôi Israel. √énsƒÉ mul»õi critici au atras aten»õia asupra faptului cƒÉ, √Æn timp ce Arafat era liderul Fatah, OLP a comis numeroase acte de terorism. Cine-i acolo? Adolf Hitler »ôi Iosif Stalin. Care Hitler »ôi Stalin? Nominaliza»õii la Premiul Nobel pentru Pace, bine√Æn»õeles. Nu »õi se pare amuzant? Nu a fost nici c√¢nd Hitler a fost propus pentru premiu, √Æn 1939. Un politician suedez l-a nominalizat pe Hitler √Æn spirit de glumƒÉ‚Äù (sau poate influen»õat de nazi»ôti), √ÆnsƒÉ nimƒÉnui nu i s-a pƒÉrut amuzant. Nominalizarea a creat un scandal uria»ô »ôi a fost retrasƒÉ imediat. √énsƒÉ nominalizƒÉrile din 1945 »ôi 1948 ale liderului sovietic Iosif Stalin au fost c√¢t se poate de serioase. Cei mai mul»õi considerƒÉ cƒÉ Premiul Nobel este o onoare importantƒÉ. √énsƒÉ doi oameni au refuzat premiul. Scriitorul francez Jean-Paul Sartre a refuzat premiul pentru literaturƒÉ, care i-a fost decernat √Æn 1964. √én 1974, i s-a alƒÉturat Le Duc Tho, care, alƒÉturi de Henry Kissinger, a primit premiul pentru eforturile de a pune capƒÉt RƒÉzboiului din Vietnam. √énsƒÉ Tho a refuzat distinc»õia, spun√¢nd cƒÉ ‚Äûpacea nu a fost √ÆncƒÉ instauratƒÉ‚Äù. Hitler reapare pe lista noastrƒÉ, de data aceasta pentru faptul cƒÉ avea o aversiune fa»õƒÉ de premiile Nobel. Aceasta a pornit de la faptul cƒÉ jurnalistul german Carl von Ossietzky, un critic vehement al lui Hitler, a primit Premiul Nobel pentru Pace √Æn 1935. Ulterior, Hitler le-a interzis germanilor sƒÉ accepte Premiul Nobel »ôi a creat o alternativƒÉ: Premiul Na»õional German pentru ArtƒÉ »ôi »òtiin»õƒÉ. Richard Kuhn (1938, chimie), Adolf Butenandt (1939, chimie) »ôi Gerhard Domagk (1939, fiziologie »ôi medicinƒÉ) au fost obliga»õi sƒÉ refuze distinc»õia. Ace»ôtia au intrat √Æn posesia diplomelor »ôi medaliilor mai t√¢rziu. √én 2008, Harald zur Hausen a primit Premiul Nobel pentru Fiziologie sau MedicinƒÉ, pentru descoperirea virusului papilloma (HPV) »ôi a legƒÉturii acestuia cu cancerul de col uterin. Problema? AstraZeneca, producƒÉtorul vaccinurilor √Æmpotriva HPV, sponsoriza site-ul web al comitetului Nobel. √én plus, doi membri ai comisiei care l-au ales pe zur Hausen aveau legƒÉturi cu AstraZeneca. De»ôi nu a ie»ôit la ivealƒÉ vreo √ÆncƒÉlcare a regulilor, acest conflict de interese a atras multe critici.",,98,"{'like_count': 71, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 372237}",PLANETA PƒÇM√ÇNT »òI CURIOZITƒÇ»öILE  EIüåè.,,2023-10-06 02:10:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/401543368_865649045039598_8625377886399020600_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=osqX5jnqc_kAX90JmtM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDnnL8ZIkCQyXzC7V10qqGJQeTMEJZZY_LEIIVMZJMg7A&oe=655B2C10,https://www.facebook.com/groups/404388984641453/permalink/879423993804614,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386610044_6739222669446296_8873583021271841445_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=EHHHVf6WavYAX8CbklE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBGZgxNz9B00RtSVieW4zaFELliJziYOS605rvRVsWBaQ&oe=6524F47C

Campesao, Borongan City, Eastern Samar. This initiative is a showcase of partnership among member agencies of the Provincial Task Force- ELCAC Eastern Samar headed by Gov. Ben P. Evardone who was represented by Engr. Joselito Mutia, PTF-ELCAC, Focal Person. The activity was attended by 29 family members of 19 active NPAs who are residents of Eastern Samar. The FReE Families project aims to help the families of active NPA members in the 802nd Brigade‚Äôs area of operation in Eastern Samar from the anxiety caused by the continued membership of their relatives in the NPA. It has been observed that these family members are also pressured by the Communist Terrorist Group‚Äôs leadership to join or support the armed struggle through disinformation such as instilling hate and fear of the government. The launching event was also a venue to know the families‚Äô concerns on having loved ones involved in the communist armed movement. These family members and relatives of active NPA members were also accompanied by their respective Barangay Chairpersons and/or Councilors during the activity to show their endless support in bringing their misguided loved ones to return to the mainstream society and live a peaceful life. Present in the launching who gladly assured to support the project and directly answered their concerns are Hon. Jose Ivan Dayan C. Agda, Mayor of Borongan City and Hon. Gilbert Go, Municipal Mayor of Giporlos. Significant partner agencies from the Situational Awareness and Knowledge Management (SAKM) Cluster of the Eastern Visayas RFT-ELCAC represented by Mr. Ariel Soliman, Assistant Regional Director for Operations; DILG Eastern Samar represented by Ms. Dionesa Marie Apura, E-CLIP Alternate Provincial Focal Person; and Eastern Samar Provincial Police Office represented by PLTCOL Dexter V. Edillo, Chief, Provincial Operation Unit Officer were also present in said event. The representatives of the different agencies highlighted the significance of family members and relatives of the remaining active NPA members, to include the barangay officials, in encouraging their loved ones to abandon the armed struggle in order to live a normal and peaceful life. With the different programs aimed in ending the local communist armed conflict, the representatives of the different government units and agencies assured the families of active NPA member- surrenderee‚Äôs safety and full benefits to be provided for reunion with their families and reintegration into their communities. Gov. Evardone wholeheartedly extends his support to the initiatives for the betterment of every family, not only to the former rebels but also to the families of those who are still in the armed struggle. The governor also assured that once their loved one‚Äôs surrender, they will be protected and be given necessary assistance for their eventual return to normal life. BGen Vestuir concluded the activity with a heart-felt message to the participants. He wholeheartedly expressed: ‚ÄúLet's show them that love can defeat the anger planted by the CPP-NPA in the hearts of your relatives. As the Army Commander here in the southern part of Samar, I assure you that they will be treated well once they surrender. Contrary to the propaganda of the CTG‚Äôs leadership, the 802nd Brigade will help them in their claims of the different programs of the LGUs and our government agencies for Former Rebels (FRs) and we fully commit our support with all available resources, foot soldiers and attention for this noble endeavor of reuniting families with their loved ones that were lost because of crooked and deceptive ideology imposed upon them by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). With the families united and living harmoniously peaceful, we are optimistic to have communities that are conflict-resilient, development-receptive and NPA-inhospitable. -30- #panawaganparasakapayapaan #freefamilies #802BdeLovesYou #KapayapaanParaSaLahat Kalinaw News 14th Infantry ""Avenger"" Battalion, Philippine Army Philippine Army 8th Civil-Military Operations Battalion - Home of Dangpanan 100.1FM 63rd Innovator Battalion 63rd Infantry ""Innovator"" Battalion, 8ID, Philippine Army 78th Infantry ""Warrior"" Battalion 78th Infantry ""Warrior"" Battalion, 8ID, Philippine Army 8th Infantry ""Stormtroopers"" Division, Philippine Army 46th Infantry ""Peacemakers"" Battalion, 8ID, Philippine Army 93rd Infantry ""Bantay Kapayapaan"" (truncated)",,98,"{'like_count': 50, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 107348}","802nd Infantry (Peerless) Brigade, 8ID, Philippine Army",,2023-10-06 03:33:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/336907442_3301284733515654_9123267121560096166_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=VP3fTLx0Iu4AX-6IUOT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBZq9Hxl7dy5DrwKR66LLh--O9IosPKs7dcsPfXzjOs3Q&oe=655A3725,https://www.facebook.com/100068675073549/posts/631982429100921,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386737542_631982455767585_1590237430476548111_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=c5wJK2hOLqMAX9SQlUE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDV7VcvkU-U1a--HC6i8-Y2BhQNQAleoNujKO5vB52m5Q&oe=652D6F38

facebook,"Sometimes, we know we‚Äôre growing: we practice a new skill, try a new approach, or respond in a different way. We may choose to change parts of our lives, like switching careers or trying to cook healthier meals. This type of growth often happens when we feel we have the capacity to expand, but we can often grow during periods of challenge, too. A difficult boss requires you to manage up, a conflict with a family member causes you to revisit an old, painful narrative, a health crisis throws your whole worldview off-kilter: hard, uncomfortable situations can prompt our growth in a myriad of ways. We meet challenging times with the best of ourselves when we intentionally choose to grow, giving ourselves space to learn, practice, and make adjustments as we go.

The ranch‚Äôs chairperson Ms Phidelis Wangari says Juja Sisal Farm Limited was the original name of the ranch, before Mzee Kenyatta took it over as part of the land consolidation after independence. She adds that there are no records of how the then-president took it over in partnership with Kiambu politician Mr Njenga Karume and Nairobi politician Mr Muhuri Muchiri. There are further claims that the total acreage of the ranch, consolidated with other lands that Mzee Kenyatta and his cronies amassed to form Embakasi, was more than 30,000 acres. The ranch‚Äôs lawyer Mr Timothy Kariuki says the takeover of Juja Sisal Farm by Embakasi Ranching and its eventual registration as a new private company rendered the former entity null and void, adding that those claiming to be owners of part or whole of the private company must prove it by showing their allotment letters or share register. The ranch has been sued 86 times in ownership tussles and all the cases involve splinter groups, all identifying themselves as Embakasi Ranching shareholders. According to Mr. Mboci Njehu, a researcher at the ranch, there is no will that Sir Wigum left behind indicating that he was bequeathing his employees or family members part or whole of the farm. The ranch in its current form is known as Embakasi Ranching at the Ministry of Lands, at the Kenya Revenue Authority and at the Registrar of Companies and not by any other official name. Besides Juja Sisal Farm, there are some other 12 entities that claim ownership of the ranch. Those calling themselves Juja Sisal Farm are in three camps; Juja Sisal employees, Juja Sisal Trustees and Former Juja Sisal Ranch Welfare. There are others calling themselves Juja Residents Self-help group and Kenyatta Juja Legacy Self-help group. All of them claim a piece of the ranch and it defines the general conflict that is deliberately sponsored by those in the multifaceted cartels that have been seeking to grab this land.",,92,"{'like_count': 82, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 279052}","Cyprian Is, Nyakundi",,2023-10-06 20:12:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/326957487_8804071469633974_6507650556618972471_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=DesrYcHb2rEAX9HWV02&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAxYFYd2t5omGphEinF5pltl4t22qGMXHNDEziQJWpkvA&oe=655B02E9,https://www.facebook.com/100044285746892/posts/868999721252878,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/384236630_868999614586222_314598952320990031_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=-xS117D38yEAX-3DgW2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBIBOB40GC947__Ut9naL6988Pv7iQ52Q70NCy-V9yh2A&oe=653C3EC8

facebook,"Erigios was a Macedonian officer in the army of Alexander the Great, originally from Lesvos, from where his father had come and settled in Amphipolis.During the conflict between Philip II and Alexander, Philip exiled him along with other close friends of Alexander. He returned to Macedonia with his brother Laomedon, when Alexander became the new king in 336 BC. A few years later, at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC he was the commander of the cavalry of the allies, just as later, when Alexander started from Ecvatana in pursuit of Darius III in 330 BC. ""When Alexander was in Arachosia, in the region that is in the heart of today's Afghanistan, he learned about an uprising of the Arians, who lived to the west, on the border of Afghanistan with Iran. He immediately sends the Mytlinaian general Erigios with his horsemen as well as other forces to suppress it. The contribution of the brave Erigius was decisive because he managed to kill in single combat the leader of the Arians, Sativarzani, ""a man of strategic and manly distinction"" according to Diodorus the Siculus, to occupy the area and subjugate the Arians to the power of Alexander. In 329 BC, together with Crateros and Hephaestion, and with the help of the seer Arisander, he tried to prevent Alexander from crossing the Jaxarti River with his troops against the Scythians. He died in 328 BC, when he was killed in battle against a group of Bactrian fugitives.

facebook,"Why is the FEAST of the OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY, on every October 7th? 
..... The story of the  VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY at the Battle of Lepanto, on OCTOBER  7, 1571.

IN TIMES OF ACUTE DANGER AND HARDSHIP, WE MUST ALWAYS FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD AND TURN TO THE RECITATION OF HER HOLY ROSARY. The Battle of Lepanto is a great lesson of confidence for us today. 

When Saint Pius V became Pope, Christendom faced the perils perhaps unequaled in its history of continual conflict with the violent followers of Mohammed. All the information and intelligence that Pope Pius V had been gathering indicated that the Ottoman juggernaut was about to roll across the Mediterranean and adjacent lands, spearheaded by the Turkish fleet, with Italy and Rome as one of its target. (The Ottoman Empire is also historically known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire)

Only Spain and Venice had the resources to resist, and they hated each other along with deep mistrust. Yet Saint Pius ‚Äî calling down divine grace as only a man of prayer could ‚Äî forged an alliance with them as the core of an organized fleet of over 200 galleys. With his considerable tact and diplomatic skills, he not only kept them unified, but he convinced them to attack the enveloping menace.

The Archbishop of Mexico had an exact copy of the HOLY IMAGE OF THE LADY OF GUADALUPE sent to King Philip II, who in turn gave it to Andrea Doria, one of the three principal admirals of the fleet, who placed it in his cabin. When the Armada went from file to line abreast and attacked on the morning of OCTOBER 7, 1571 the blue standard of OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE was also flying from the masthead of Don Juan‚Äôs flagship. 

Pope Pius V, a Dominican prelate before becoming a Pope, did what Catholics have always done in times of acute danger: FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD. As a follower of Saint Dominic, HE KNEW THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF IMPLORING HER HELP WAS THROUGH THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY. He ordered all monasteries and convents in Rome to increase their prayers for the impending battle and organized ROSARY PROCESSIONS in which he, as sick as he was, participated. OUR LADY‚ÄôS PRESENCE THAT DAY WAS MORE ACUTELY FELT THROUGH THE HOLY ROSARY.

As the Christian fleet sailed toward the great clash, MASS WAS CELEBRATED AND THE ROSARY RECITED DAILY ON EACH VESSEL‚Ä¶.. THIS HEARTFELT REQUEST FOR DIVINE ASSISTANCE RESULTED IN A CRUSHING DEFEAT OF THE OTTOMANS AT LEPANTO THAT ENDED THEIR DOMINANCE AND CRUELTY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. OCTOBER 7, 1571, WAS THE VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY, EVEN IF THE CHRISTIAN FLEET WAS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE OTTOMAN FLEET.

TO CELEBRATE OUR LADY‚ÄôS INTERCESSION AND VICTORY, THE CHURCH HAS DESIGNATED OCTOBER 7 AS THE FEAST OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY. Similar acknowledgement to the Blessed Virgin‚Äôs intercession through the Rosary were made when John Sobieski forced the Turks to lift the Siege of Vienna in 1683 and after the victory of Prince Eugene of Savoy at Temesvar in his successful campaign to remove the Ottomans from Europe in the next century.",,86,"{'like_count': 55, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 847319}",Lord Jesus & Mother Mary,,2023-10-06 15:41:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/123741454_2819567628365407_1049366548939414676_n.jpg?stp=c0.6.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=SZgEwV3X1CEAX-OmiGF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAtoYbJsaOhGKUaJxyuJtJrWTAcQ_9ApRDxgKIdYeO8ZQ&oe=657D3B7C,https://www.facebook.com/groups/790848504787530/permalink/1555990194940020,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386786913_6622074261203396_5928534652368284138_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=Qg0P94W8ylIAX9sFoJO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCNTKI1pWNU0ePVQvu8_kfkzFpLjoa5fBVRrQVBT5-K3g&oe=6524553F
facebook,"During a visit to the villagers of Mahera to conduct their revered Friday prayers in a historic act that will likely be etched into the history of Sierra Leone, the respected leader of the All People's Congress (APC) and Ambassador Osman Foday Yansaneh, were able to be in attendance as they took part in their revered Friday prayers, according to Dr. Samura M. W. Kamara, the respected leader of the APC party. It is worth noting that the trip of the political powerhouse was not simply a public relations campaign; it also served to celebrate the renowned Bai Bureh, the man who spearheaded the Hut Tax War, and his enduring legacy. The reason why Dr. Kamara visited Mahera wasn't just to make political points; it was also an opportunity to pay a thoughtful tribute to Bai Bureh, a great fighter whose spirit, in many ways, best defines the values of the APC, which are empowerment and resistance. During his spiritual pilgrimage to Mahera, Bai Bureh's birthplace, Dr Kamara made sure that he made a clear connection between the past and the present by picking the site of Bai Bureh's birth as the site of his pilgrimage. During his speech, he made the connection between the struggle against colonial control and the current struggle for social justice and development in our nation today. In a display of harmony that defies the division frequently seen in modern politics, today's prayer gathering drew Muslims and Christians of all ages. Dr. Kamara's visit to the Mahera mosque was a clear indication of a leader prepared to look beyond established boundaries in order to advance society. The media hysteria surrounding Dr. Kamara's travel to Mahera is probably going to die down, but the significance of this pilgrimage symbolically will definitely endure. The APC leader's acts provide a ray of hope in a time of uncertainty and conflict by serving as a reminder to Sierra Leoneans that tradition and unity may still prevail in the contemporary era.",,85,"{'like_count': 69, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 25287}","My Sierra Leone, My Responsiblity",,2023-10-06 21:20:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/332171714_713422023605381_7523112177878565090_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=UcZNgWtaBTcAX-0SpYl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAsh27Filas-dW08zvaAlSEdy4Y3s0tF4biCwVDKR_-JQ&oe=6559F067,https://www.facebook.com/100063767587698/posts/804607798341466,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385502626_804607945008118_1597121184279186864_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=KPHhF_WgotwAX8Lsosw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC15hJC9jD8f-DJ7hTFiwWpJ7kaQe1D7xSdln-GhrILBA&oe=6525B32A
facebook,"Friday House Fellowship on the Radio: With Pee Dave üåπ üåπ üåπ üåπ üåπ Topic: Handling Conflicts in a Christian Marriage. Text:Amos 3:3, Proverbs 27:5, Col 3:16, Eph 5:19, James 5:13, James 4:7, Romans 12:18, James 1:19-20 . Marital conflict is an inevitable part of any marriage and can arise from various sources. Differences in personality, values, and expectations are just a few examples of issues that can lead to occasional conflict. However, how couples handle these conflicts is crucial in maintaining a healthy and happy relationship. As Christians, we benefit from Christian guidance on approaching conflicts constructively. The Bible offers valuable insights on handling conflicts,. Thus the following and more are ways in which we can handle conflicts in Christian marriages. Seek God‚Äôs Guidance Seeking God‚Äôs guidance is paramount. Praying together and asking for His help can provide a foundation of humility and a desire for reconciliation. It is important to remember that we are not alone in our struggles and that God is always ready to guide us toward the right path. Listen Actively Active listening is an essential skill when it comes to resolving conflict. Taking turns listening without interrupting or getting defensive can create an environment of mutual respect and understanding. Repeating what you hear can ensure that both parties fully understand each other‚Äôs perspectives. Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù Statements Using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements instead of blaming or accusing can help express how the conflict affects you personally. This approach avoids blaming the other person and focuses on how their actions have impacted. Find Common Ground Finding common ground can be a powerful tool in resolving conflicts. Instead of focusing solely on differences, look for areas of agreement and work together towards finding a solution that benefits both parties. This approach creates a sense of teamwork and collaboration rather than opposition. Forgive Each Other Forgiveness is crucial in resolving conflicts within Christian marriage. Remembering that forgiveness does not mean forgetting, but letting go of resentment and bitterness can lead to healing within the relationship. Forgiveness allows us to move forward with love, grace, and compassion toward one another. Seek Counseling If Needed If the conflict proves too challenging to resolve on your own, seeking counseling from a Christian counselor who provides guidance and support may be necessary. Seeking outside help does not indicate weakness but rather shows a willingness to work towards resolution within the relationship. Communication Communication is integral to any healthy relationship, especially within Christian marriages where open and honest communication is paramount. Communication can help bridge the gap between two parties and facilitate understanding. The Power of Apologies Apologizing can be a powerful tool in resolving conflicts within Christian marriages. A sincere apology acknowledges any wrongdoing on our part and expresses remorse for any hurt or pain caused. It can create an environment of humility, grace, and forgiveness within the relationship. Question. What other practical steps can be applied in resolving Christian marital conflicts.?? Drop your Contributions, Prayer Request and Questions.

facebook,"Govt ready to combat organised crime The Government admits crime rates, including instances of violence, theft and drug-related offences have risen alarmingly in recent years, posing a significant threat to the safety and security of our citizens. Additionally, the presence of organised crime groups and the illicit trade they engage in further exacerbates the situation, undermining our efforts towards progress and development. Furthermore, the Government cannot ignore the issue of tribal conflicts that persist in certain regions of our country. Internal Security Minister Peter Tsiamalili Jr, however, presented in Parliament in his ministerial address that the government is fully committed to addressing these pressing issues. ‚ÄúIn light of these challenges, I assure you that the government is fully committed to ensuring the internal security of PNG. We recognise that a multifaceted approach is necessary to effectively tackle these issues and protect our citizens. Therefore, we will focus on several key areas of action,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese conflicts, fueled by historical grievances, land disputes, and socioeconomic disparities, continue to disrupt communities, displace families, and hinder the establishment of lasting peace and stability. ‚ÄúIt is our duty to address the root cause of these conflicts and work towards their resolution through dialogue, mediation, and equitable development initiatives. We will prioritise law enforcement and enhance the capacity of our police force. This includes strengthening training programs, equipping police officers with necessary resources, and ensuring that personnel are adequately distributed across the country. ‚ÄúWe will work towards increasing the number of police officers, improving their skills in investigation and crime prevention, and fostering better coordination with relevant government agencies. ‚ÄúWe will also take decisive steps to combat organised crime and reduce the influence of illicit activities in our society. This will involve bolstering our intelligence capabilities, enhancing border control measures, and working closely with international partners to address transnational crime networks. ‚ÄúWe will enact stricter legislation and enforce stronger penalties for those involved in organised criminal activities we will also prioritise community engagement and empowerment. We understand that sustainable security cannot be achieved solely through law enforcement measures. ‚ÄúWe will promote community-oriented initiatives that encourage dialogue, foster trust, and empower local communities to take ownership of their security. ‚ÄúBy addressing the underlying social, economic, and political factors contributing to crime and conflict, we can build resilient communities that are more resistant to violence and criminal activities,‚Äù he said.

The natural laws are hidden in nature. Hidden are solutions to everyday problems such as; conflict resolution, how to forgive, lessons about differences, how to manage organizations, how to think. Hidden are feelings. You can look at something and you will feel it. At night, have you ever looked at the sky when there are no clouds? As you look at all the stars, your heart will become very joyful. You will walk away feeling joyful and peaceful. We need to visit nature so we can see and feel these things.

facebook,"Thought for the day: Sometimes taking a long time to teach something is not in the horses best interests. There are some things that should not be half taught because by half teaching it we have not really made a change. The problem is that by half teaching it we have set the horse up to learn more ways of not achieving something. Im not talking about progressive things like manoeuvres but life skills. How to not run over us or pull away cannot be half taught. ""Taking the time it takes"" is a good policy when bringing a horse along but often it can be an excuse for not making progress with important starting places. If you're not making progress with some of these things you are probably in need of some help. ""Take the time it takes to take away the conflict in the horses life in one session."" (You do not have to run a horse or fight with it to do this) The next most important thing after that is maintaining the change by being consistent. A trainer can help make a change in your horse but what takes time is forming a habit. The phenomenal and cool thing about making these changes (sometimes getting a change in the types of behaviour I am talking about is quite a job) is that if you do it well a horse will not hold it against you. I find that once I have worked through it the horse actually relaxes and likes me more. Its like someone has helped him by taking the conflict out of his life. Until this is achieved we really can't effectively teach the things that they learn over time.",,83,"{'like_count': 53, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 10879}",Ian Leighton Horsemanship,,2023-10-06 00:50:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311141652_533135505483173_2358362136005476721_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=gqN0Pisdph0AX_tgIBf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDf3nz34DGsm6Sc_etcRQH_zxHr5Gsyk-vr6Ur0KTNR6w&oe=655B1C68,https://www.facebook.com/100063601842007/posts/818786073584780,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386763195_18266870653089524_1282086470895985837_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=04AZFguk7WAAX-CIJ4p&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCmt7yhGrfH3Ly411O_aJIXVLYsHlYw8IxbZtlgMcK38w&oe=655AAD15

facebook,"On this date in 1927, ""The Jazz Singer"" premiered. As the first feature-length motion picture with not only a synchronized recorded music score, but also lip-synchronous singing and speech in several isolated sequences, its release heralded the commercial ascendance of sound films and ended the silent film era. Directed by Alan Crosland and produced by Warner Bros. with its Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, the film, featuring six songs performed by Al Jolson, is based on a play of the same name by Samson Raphaelson, adapted from one of his short stories, ""The Day of Atonement."" The film depicts the fictional story of Jakie Rabinowitz, a young man who defies the traditions of his devout Jewish family. After singing popular tunes in a beer garden he is punished by his father, a hazzan (cantor), prompting Jakie to run away from home. Some years later, now calling himself Jack Robin, he has become a talented jazz singer. He attempts to build a career as an entertainer but his professional ambitions ultimately come into conflict with the demands of his home and heritage. Darryl F. Zanuck won an Honorary Academy Award for producing the film; Alfred A. Cohn was nominated for Best Writing (Adaptation) at the 1st Academy Awards. In 1996, ""The Jazz Singer"" was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"" motion pictures. In 1998, the film was chosen in voting conducted by the American Film Institute as one of the best American films of all time, ranking at number ninety.

facebook,"5th October, 2023 THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF NIGERIA AND CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL JUDICIAL COUNCIL THREE ARMS ZONE FCT, ABUJA SIR, RE: PETITION AGAINST HON. JUSTICE B.M TUKUR, HON. JUSTICE OMEKA ELEKWA AND HON. JUSTICE O.A ADETUJOYE FOR DELIBERATE PERVERSION OF JUSTICE AND CONSPIRACY TO REMOVE CANDIDATES OF OUR PARTY ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT The above refers. Our attention has been drawn to a purported Petition with the above caption written by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) dated 15th September, 2023 and signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the Plateau State Chapter of the PDP. As interested parties who also sponsored candidates in the 2023 General Election in Plateau State, we are obligated to put the records straight as it is very shocking and surprising to us. This is also very clear from the content of the Petition written by the PDP against the Learned Judges of the Election Petition Tribunal in Plateau State as can be seen, no exact action of the jurists capable of perverting Justice was pointed out by the PDP aside the fact that the Judges delivered Judgments. No procedural error was pointed out to show bias, lack of fair hearing or descending into the arena of conflict. PUTTING THE RECORDS STRAIGHT The Judgments delivered by HON. JUSTICE B.M TUKUR, HON. JUSTICE OMEKA ELEKWA AND HON. JUSTICE O.A ADETUJOYE is in line with cautions and warnings that were in the public domain before the 2023 general elections, about the inescapable disaster or peril that would eventually befall the PDP in Plateau State for disrespect, continuous violation and disobedience to the Judgments and Orders of Court. Well, like it is said, ""time reveals"". But it is worrisome that the PDP are making storms at the outcome of the decisions under review. For the avoidance of doubt, it is important to note that the General Elections where members of the public go out to vote, is actually the concluding part of the electoral process. Election is a process and defect in any of the processes, renders the outcome of the secondary election, a nullity no matter how well conducted it might otherwise be regarded. The process inter alia, includes Registration of Political Parties, Congresses to elect EXCO for the Party at all levels, Conduct of Primary Elections and Qualification of both the Political Party to sponsor candidates and that of the Candidates to contest an Election. All these processes are regulated by Law and must be adhered to, stricto senso. Thankfully, the Court is the last part of the Electoral Process and that is where we are presently. The Tribunal at all levels in Plateau State have been inundated with one potent Ground of Petition by both the Labour Party (LP), Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) aside the general irregularities in the Conduct of Elections. This Ground challenges the Qualification of PDP to field in candidates to contest for elections in Plateau State while living in flagrant disobedience to Court Orders. In proving Ground One, the Petitioners relied and tendered avalanche of cases decided against the PDP as follows: 1. Certified True Copies of the Judgment in Suit No. PLD/J/304/2020- Between: Bitrus Kaze and Others Vs. PDP and Others. This is the genesis of the misfortunes of PDP. Here, the Court ordered PDP to conduct Ward, LGA and State Congresses to elect their leaders. In other words, the Court ordered PDP to form their ""structure"". Mind you, forming Political Structure is part of the Electoral Process a Political Party must fulfil. 2. Certified True Copies of Judgment Between: PDP v Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC) in Suit No. PLD/J/250/2021. Since PDP failed to obey the Order in the first case, the PLASIEC excluded PDP from participating in the Local Government Elections for not complying with the Orders of Court. The PDP filed the above case against PLASIEC and lost. PDP appealed this case to the Court of Appeal and lost on the ground that they are in disobedience to Court Order and when the PDP further appealed to the Supreme Court, they abandoned the Appeal and the Supreme Court dismissed the Appeal on the 7th December, 2022 for want of diligent prosecution. 3. Certified True Copies of the Judgement of the High Court of Plateau State in Suit No. PLD/J276CV/2020 dated 24/6/2021 Between: Ishaku Adamu Izang Vs. Markus Husseini Nyam (AKA Kaunde). In this case, the High Court granted the reliefs claimed by the Claimants and set aside the Local Government Congresses conducted by PDP and PDP is yet to conduct congresses for the purpose of constituting its Wards, Local Government and State organs of the Party. 4. Certified True Copies of the Ruling of the High Court of Plateau State in Suit No. PLD/J276CV/2020 dated 24/2/2022 Between: Ishaku Adamu Izang Vs. Markus Husseini Nyam (AKA Kaunde Without conducting special congresses to constitute the various organs of the Party in Plateau State, PDP filed a Motion seeking to set aside the (truncated)",,78,"{'like_count': 26, 'comment_count': 37, 'num_users': 92195}",PLATEAU POLITICS,,2023-10-06 14:27:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/11391331_955462834484080_6779661043108635921_n.jpg?stp=c13.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=xtcpjly3VUsAX8vGsM_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBxfbtlhtWvKJ_bp0UqlxY9Opek3wtnHl2cVdjYyL5A8g&oe=657D4A4C,https://www.facebook.com/groups/387166634721219/permalink/6266877860083371,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387059765_4081761505383689_5804624305737234254_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=yJyWg66c-6YAX9JbX9R&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAgTXAxsYvgtM8IARoujnt2wWO2GWC4uxK1PUu3kJxfVA&oe=65298EEA

facebook,"People think I‚Äôm foolish. They don‚Äôt come out and say it, but it shows on their faces. I read it in there befuddled surprise. I see it in their bridled disbelief. What‚Äôs perplexing is this: I release my original work without copyright. All musical compositions, writings, and (when possible) recordings can be reused without constraint, acknowledgement, or payment. I sell no licensing. I require no credit. This can seem like self-sabotage. Many a house has been bought thanks to royalty checks. I‚Äôm leaving money on the table not just now, but for the rest of my life (and beyond!). But there‚Äôs the rub. I don‚Äôt present this work to make money. I give it as an offering, with the hope that it will make the world a better place. My mission is to discover and present the beauty I‚Äôm uniquely positioned for. There‚Äôs a direct conflict between that goal and maintaining intellectual property. The more difficult I make it to share the fruits of my labor, the less easily those fruits can beautify the world. I choose more beauty. When the work of writing, practicing, or recording is finished, let the results be enjoyed by any who might be edified by them. Thus I present the ‚Äòvideobook‚Äô of Honey, If It Wasn‚Äôt for You. It‚Äôs a poignantly beautiful story, and you can watch the video for free. Then if you want a copy for yourself, you can get one at https://book.barronryan.com.:=:https://www.barronryan.com/get-the-book Money will come.

Our attention has been drawn to a purported Petition with the above caption written by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) dated 15th September, 2023 and signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the Plateau State Chapter of the PDP. As interested parties who also sponsored candidates in the 2023 General Election in Plateau State, we are obligated to put the records straight as it is very shocking and surprising to us. This is also very clear from the content of the Petition written by the PDP against the Learned Judges of the Election Petition Tribunal in Plateau State as can be seen, no exact action of the jurists capable of perverting Justice was pointed out by the PDP aside the fact that the Judges delivered Judgments. No procedural error was pointed out to show bias, lack of fair hearing or descending into the arena of conflict. PUTTING THE RECORDS STRAIGHT The Judgments delivered by HON. JUSTICE B.M TUKUR, HON. JUSTICE OMEKA ELEKWA AND HON. JUSTICE O.A ADETUJOYE is in line with cautions and warnings that were in the public domain before the 2023 general elections, about the inescapable disaster or peril that would eventually befall the PDP in Plateau State for disrespect, continuous violation and disobedience to the Judgments and Orders of Court. Well, like it is said, ""time reveals"". But it is worrisome that the PDP are making storms at the outcome of the decisions under review. For the avoidance of doubt, it is important to note that the General Elections where members of the public go out to vote, is actually the concluding part of the electoral process. Election is a process and defect in any of the processes, renders the outcome of the secondary election, a nullity no matter how well conducted it might otherwise be regarded. The process inter alia, includes Registration of Political Parties, Congresses to elect EXCO for the Party at all levels, Conduct of Primary Elections and Qualification of both the Political Party to sponsor candidates and that of the Candidates to contest an Election. All these processes are regulated by Law and must be adhered to, stricto senso. Thankfully, the Court is the last part of the Electoral Process and that is where we are presently. The Tribunal at all levels in Plateau State have been inundated with one potent Ground of Petition by both the Labour Party (LP), Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) aside the general irregularities in the Conduct of Elections. This Ground challenges the Qualification of PDP to field in candidates to contest for elections in Plateau State while living in flagrant disobedience to Court Orders. In proving Ground One, the Petitioners relied and tendered avalanche of cases decided against the PDP as follows: 1. Certified True Copies of the Judgment in Suit No. PLD/J/304/2020- Between: Bitrus Kaze and Others Vs. PDP and Others. This is the genesis of the misfortunes of PDP. Here, the Court ordered PDP to conduct Ward, LGA and State Congresses to elect their leaders. In other words, the Court ordered PDP to form their ""structure"". Mind you, forming Political Structure is part of the Electoral Process a Political Party must fulfil. 2. Certified True Copies of Judgment Between: PDP v Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC) in Suit No. PLD/J/250/2021. Since PDP failed to obey the Order in the first case, the PLASIEC excluded PDP from participating in the Local Government Elections for not complying with the Orders of Court. The PDP filed the above case against PLASIEC and lost. PDP appealed this case to the Court of Appeal and lost on the ground that they are in disobedience to Court Order and when the PDP further appealed to the Supreme Court, they abandoned the Appeal and the Supreme Court dismissed the Appeal on the 7th December, 2022 for want of diligent prosecution. 3. Certified True Copies of the Judgement of the High Court of Plateau State in Suit No. PLD/J276CV/2020 dated 24/6/2021 Between: Ishaku Adamu Izang Vs. Markus Husseini Nyam (AKA Kaunde). In this case, the High Court granted the reliefs claimed by the Claimants and set aside the Local Government Congresses conducted by PDP and PDP is yet to conduct congresses for the purpose of constituting its Wards, Local Government and State organs of the Party. 4. Certified True Copies of the Ruling of the High Court of Plateau State in Suit No. PLD/J276CV/2020 dated 24/2/2022 Between: Ishaku Adamu Izang Vs. Markus Husseini Nyam (AKA Kaunde Without conducting special congresses to constitute the various organs of the Party in Plateau State, PDP filed a Motion seeking to set aside the (truncated)",,76,"{'like_count': 22, 'comment_count': 47, 'num_users': 67456}",PLATEAU POLITICS,,2023-10-06 14:28:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/351344217_1479405656160940_8961359117327073112_n.jpg?stp=c20.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bcsM-6U3UOUAX_ItZ6E&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBGPel6iSuCaZ6tHrUlwF-cG4EsprUaAP4dMXsZKjR4sw&oe=655A788C,https://www.facebook.com/groups/799281698265123/permalink/862954628564496,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386512079_4081762652050241_3049491888665220294_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=bldlwr5ytYMAX-p5TZJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAF84svr3nMWb3pGzTJP5LntzplBn_TJjldNhehUPsQCg&oe=65247B58
facebook,"Callie Eh, Malaysian / Swiss Photographer, born 1972 The Journey, (Morocco), 2022 Fine Art Photography ""A sunset in Sahara displays some of the most spectacular sand dunes, representing the colors of nature with an orange glow and shadow reflection."" Born and raised in Malaysia, currently based in Switzerland. Her travels have inspired her to capture life with photography. What started off as a hobby, capturing special moments of her time around new cities and environments eventually evolved into a career she never foresaw coming. This very passion drove her to use the camera to express and deliver narratives previously unseen and untold. For her, photography became more than a way of creating memories. ‚ÄãPhotography has been a tremendous support for Callie and It has been a refuge for Callie during difficult times and a safe space to explore a multitude of emotions concerning love, conflict, and hope. Callie‚Äôs works mostly refer to life ‚ÄúIn the moment‚Äù. She captures people to reveal honesty and express the authenticity of their individuality, heritage, and life. The raw power of her images makes us want to know more about the subjects, their life, and their personal stories. ‚ÄãARTIST STATEMENT For me photography was a life-saver. It picked me up at a difficult time in my life and I have not let it go ever since. Originally from Malaysia, I have lived in various countries and I am now based in Switzerland. Photography has changed my view of the world and has made me see things differently. I like to mix genres but my greatest photographic passion right now is documentary photography, inspired by my travels, the people I meet, the different cultures and the different ways of life.",,76,"{'like_count': 36, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 136352}",A CELEBRATION OF FEMALE ARTISTS,,2023-10-06 15:03:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/396963602_3699287400300326_7035825126309722014_n.jpg?stp=c0.9.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=J5q2vca4KYwAX_zIcYL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfATogUDIGqS7uG04ZSjVo4_5em9qdEKVBm2445ydxM_VQ&oe=655A8111,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1080475609511196/permalink/1348408956051192,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386597549_6148486225251537_8019076907484224553_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=LPHTeNtUg1IAX8OZP5u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB2o13LeNeRnlgJvkXbhfZGQTfiHi6FEY8K7qfJL1_0eQ&oe=65244328

facebook,"‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚Äù, Kintpuash (c. 1837-1873) Modoc Tribe, Oregon and California Kintpuash was born near Tule Lake, an area that now straddles the Oregon-California border. The ancestral homeland of the Modoc Peoples consisted of 5,000 acres until 1864 when they were forcibly removed by the federal government to the lands of their neighbors on the newly-created Klamath Reservation. The Klamath was a much larger tribe than the Modoc, and conflict was inevitable. Now casually referred to as ‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚Äù by white colonizers, Kintpuash stood firm. In 1865 he led a band of Modoc from the reservation back to their lands in California. Four years went by before the United States army rounded them up again and back to Klamath territory, but Kintpuash was undaunted. In 1870 he marched back home again with 180 of his Modoc kinsmen. The government‚Äôs outright refusal to allow the Modoc back into their homelands led to the outbreak of the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873. Kintpuash fled with his band into the area now protected as the Lava Beds National Monument, and they settled into this natural fortress. His warriors made use of its many caves and trenches in the lava beds for defensive fighting, and women and children could be sheltered there. When the Modoc were finally located, the Army launched an attack on January 17, 1873. The US Army was beaten in this conflict but they weren‚Äôt retreating either. Kintpuash‚Äôs advisers suggested that the Army would leave if their warriors killed its leader General Edward Canby, (the future namesake of the town of Canby, Oregon) but Kintpuash hoped for a peaceful solution that would allow his people to stay in their territory. It wasn‚Äôt to be. During the next meeting of the peace commission on April 11, Kintpuash and several other Modoc broke down and drew pistols at a prearranged signal; he shot General Canby twice in the head. For this, he was executed on October 3, 1873. The area of the Lava Beds National Monument where Captain Jack and his men held out against the United States Army is now known as Captain Jack‚Äôs Stronghold. It took until 1984 for Kintpuash‚Äôs skull to be returned for proper reburial by his Modoc descendants. He is buried at Fort Klamath Park, Oregon.",,75,"{'like_count': 57, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 55753}",Native American Blood,,2023-10-06 14:21:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/276130877_1126313238169452_8040490155062032181_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IY7xnRy0bkEAX926Ffd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD7fLHp9p9baHO_gFOsVpFExq8UvK1_sLXwA5JaoAzTIQ&oe=6559F8CF,https://www.facebook.com/100069255943741/posts/659002919751567,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387058451_659002839751575_4158047394631950914_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=l_NkLYVmyqUAX8rFXRY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDQBherS7o3l5c30QOZM0cOAJPHIlEmUM4NQZxDTrXbMQ&oe=6525C693

KEEPING THE LAW DOES NOT SAVE ANYONE BUT OBEYING GOD ü§î

BUT HOW CAN YOU SAY AM OBEYING GOD WHILE YOU'RE NOT KEEPING HIS LAW AND DOING THEM‚ÅâÔ∏èüôÜüëá

KJV James 2:17
17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

 YOU CAN'T HAVE FAITH AND REJECT THE LAW,ALL THEY'RE TWIN

OBEY GOD NOW BECAUSE JESUS WILL NOT GO BACK TO THE CROSS AGAIN üëá

KJV Hebrews 10:26
26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,

Look upon the scene in lonely Gethsemane. Angels witness with amazement the despairing agony of the Son of God, and nature groans in sympathy with her bleeding, dying Author. The earth trembles. The sun refuses to behold the scene. The heavens gather blackness. The angelic host hide their faces from the awful sight. The separation that sin makes between God and man was fully realized by the innocent, suffering Man of Calvary. He was oppressed by the powers of darkness. Satan declared that Christ was in his hands, and that he was superior in strength to the Son of God, that God had disowned his Son. If Christ was indeed in favor with God, why need He die? Could not God save Him from death? BEcho September 15,  1892, par. 1

Such were the temptations that Satan pressed upon the Son of God, while legions of evil angels were all about Him, and the holy angels were not permitted to break their ranks, and engage in conflict with the reviling foe. Christ could not see through the portals of the tomb. Bright hope did not present to Him his coming forth from the grave a triumphant conqueror, or tell Him of the Father's acceptance of his sacrifice. All He could realize during this time of amazing darkness was the heinousness of sin that was laid upon Him, and the horror of its penalty, death. He feared that sin was so offensive in the sight of his Father that their separation was eternal. The temptation that his own Father had forever left Him, caused that fearful cry from the cross, ""My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?"" BEcho September 15,  1892, par. 2

Though all was enshrouded in gloom, yet amid the awful darkness, which was felt even by sympathizing nature, the Redeemer drained the mysterious cup to the dregs. Though He realizes but dimly that He shall triumph over death, He cries with a loud voice, ""Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit."" He is acquainted with the character of his Father; He understands his justice, his mercy, and his great love; in submission He commends Himself to God. Amid the convulsions of nature, the amazed spectators hear the dying words of the Man of Calvary, ""It is finished!"" BEcho September 15,  1892, par. 3

The heaving earth, the rent rocks, and the terrific darkness, proclaimed that it was the Son of God who died. There was a mighty earthquake. The vail of the temple was rent in twain.  BEcho September 15,  1892, par. 4

Jesus did not yield up his life until He had accomplished the work which He came to do, and exclaimed with his expiring breath, ""It is finished."" Angels rejoiced as the words were uttered. They knew that Satan was defeated, his kingdom lost. The great plan of redemption, which was dependent upon the death of Christ, had been thus far carried out, and there was joy in heaven that through faith in Christ the sons of Adam could finally be exalted to the throne of God. BEcho September 15,  1892, par. 5

. O, what love! what amazing love! that the Son of God should come to earth to be made sin for us, in order that we might be reconciled to God, and exalted to a place with Him in the mansions of glory. And O, what is man that such a price should be paid for his redemption! BEcho September 15,  1892, par. 7

Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God!"" Here is love that no language can express.

facebook,"Friday House Fellowship on the Radio: With Pee Dave üåπ üåπ üåπ üåπ üåπ Topic: Handling Conflicts in a Christian Marriage. Text:Amos 3:3, Proverbs 27:5, Col 3:16, Eph 5:19, James 5:13, James 4:7, Romans 12:18, James 1:19-20 . Marital conflict is an inevitable part of any marriage and can arise from various sources. Differences in personality, values, and expectations are just a few examples of issues that can lead to occasional conflict. However, how couples handle these conflicts is crucial in maintaining a healthy and happy relationship. As Christians, we benefit from Christian guidance on approaching conflicts constructively. The Bible offers valuable insights on handling conflicts,. Thus the following and more are ways in which we can handle conflicts in Christian marriages. Seek God‚Äôs Guidance Seeking God‚Äôs guidance is paramount. Praying together and asking for His help can provide a foundation of humility and a desire for reconciliation. It is important to remember that we are not alone in our struggles and that God is always ready to guide us toward the right path. Listen Actively Active listening is an essential skill when it comes to resolving conflict. Taking turns listening without interrupting or getting defensive can create an environment of mutual respect and understanding. Repeating what you hear can ensure that both parties fully understand each other‚Äôs perspectives. Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù Statements Using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements instead of blaming or accusing can help express how the conflict affects you personally. This approach avoids blaming the other person and focuses on how their actions have impacted. Find Common Ground Finding common ground can be a powerful tool in resolving conflicts. Instead of focusing solely on differences, look for areas of agreement and work together towards finding a solution that benefits both parties. This approach creates a sense of teamwork and collaboration rather than opposition. Forgive Each Other Forgiveness is crucial in resolving conflicts within Christian marriage. Remembering that forgiveness does not mean forgetting, but letting go of resentment and bitterness can lead to healing within the relationship. Forgiveness allows us to move forward with love, grace, and compassion toward one another. Seek Counseling If Needed If the conflict proves too challenging to resolve on your own, seeking counseling from a Christian counselor who provides guidance and support may be necessary. Seeking outside help does not indicate weakness but rather shows a willingness to work towards resolution within the relationship. Communication Communication is integral to any healthy relationship, especially within Christian marriages where open and honest communication is paramount. Communication can help bridge the gap between two parties and facilitate understanding. The Power of Apologies Apologizing can be a powerful tool in resolving conflicts within Christian marriages. A sincere apology acknowledges any wrongdoing on our part and expresses remorse for any hurt or pain caused. It can create an environment of humility, grace, and forgiveness within the relationship. Question. What other practical steps can be applied in resolving Christian marital conflicts.?? Drop your Contributions, Prayer Request and Questions.

facebook,"PILLARS OF OUR FAITH What are the pillars of our faith and what implications does they carry? I have come to notice that whenever you talk about the pillars of our faith, most seventh day adventists would conflict if the personality of God and Christ is one of them. And a few who accept lessens it's importance. Why do many seventh day adventist try to obscure the fact that the personality of God and Christ were pillars of our faith? The answer is simple_If its a pillar, Then it was established and Ellen g white words forbid removing any pillar. Was the personality of God really a pillar, was it established by our pioneers and what does this mean it being changed. Was the personality of God a pillar? ‚ÄúThose who seek to remove the old landmarks are not holding fast; they are not remembering how they have received and heard. *Those who try to bring in theories that would remove the *pillars of our faith concerning the sanctuary or concerning the personality of God or of Christ are working as blind men*. They are seeking to bring in uncertainties and to set the people of God adrift without an anchor. {YRP 235.3}. ‚ÄúA Warning Against False Theories,‚Äù May 24, 1905.) {MR760 12.2} Its such clear that the personality of God and Christ is as much a pillar as is the sanctuary. Did our pioneers search to know and establish this pillar? WHO IS DEPARTING FROM THE FAITH LAID DOWN, THE VERY FOUNDATION THAT WE WERE ON A WHOLE CENTURY AGO? WE ARE ON THE VERY SAME FOUNDATION; we have the same evidence, and we worked on it day and night, TO KNOW IN REGARD TO THE SANCTUARY QUESTION, AND REGARD TO THE PERSONALITY OF GOD AND OF CHRIST, and of all these subjects.‚Äù {Ms138-1906.40} Notice the spirit of prophecy clear say, The foundation was laid down, notice according to Ellen g white, They were on the same foundation, they were, a whole century before. He also says ""We"" Which shows Plurality. Many today think Ellen g white was the one who knew the truth on this point and changed. Is the truth about the personality of God any important? ""The sanctuary question is a clear and definite doctrine as we have held it as a people. You are not definitely clear on the personality of God, which is everything to us as a people. You have virtually destroyed the Lord God Himself."" 18LtMs, Lt 300, 1903, par. 7 When kellogg started teaching Pantheism, Ellen g white said the truth about the personality of God was established already ‚ÄúThe light is given to me in regard to the POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE TRUTH, that these sophistries, and this mysticism, and DOING AWAY WITH THE PERSONALITY OF GOD, AND WITH THE PERSONALITY OF CHRIST, will get the hall-room of the heart all ready for these miracles that Satan will come to work right in our midst. Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.‚Äù (Ms138-1906.40} Was light about Christ and his mission understood? Thus light was given that helped us to understand the scriptures IN REGARD TO CHRIST, HIS MISSION, AND HIS PRIESTHOOD. A LINE OF TRUTH EXTENDING FROM THAT TIME TO THE TIME WHEN WE SHALL ENTER THE CITY OF GOD, WAS MADE PLAIN TO ME, and I gave to others the instruction that the Lord had given me. {EW xxii.4} (RH, May 25, 1905 par. 24) According to many seventh day adventists to day, to believe in what the pioneers believed about Christ is a denial of his Divinity. Mrs white on the contrary says, no one believed in the divinity of Christ as did seventh day adventists at that time. . For instance, an effort was made to obtain the use of the hall at a village four miles from Hastings, where some of our workers proposed to present the gospel to the people; but they did not succeed in obtaining the hall, because a school-teacher there opposed the truth, and declared to the people that Seventh-day Adventists did not believe in the divinity of Christ. This man may not have known what our faith is on this point, but he was not left in ignorance. He was informed that there is not a people on earth who hold more firmly to the truth of Christ's pre-existence than do Seventh-day Adventists. But the answer was given that they did not want that the doctrines of Seventh-day Adventists should be promulgated in that community. So the door was closed. RH, DecDec 5,1893. Its surprising to find that the same accusations are held today. Was light about the holy Spirit understood? Light came to me months ago that there was work that must be done. A company of us were praying and the power of God was in our midst. IF ANY COME UP WITH MODERN THOUGHTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT which takes off from the sanctuary, we need to be on guard, for God wants us to stand in the right position. THIS TRUTH HAS BEEN GIVEN US POINT BY POINT and if we take a piece out of our faith it will leave us, as Christ said, on the sand.

facebook,"üìå LATEST: ABC News Covers Exodus of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh GORIS: ABC News Middle East Correspondent Tom Joyner produced a 5-minute long segment on the latest developments in the Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) and the Republic of Armenia following Azerbaijan's military assault against the 120,000 indigenous Armenians, reported the Armenian National Committee of Australia. The segment included interviews with indigenous Armenians, including those who recount all they have lost, including loved ones and property, as generations of Armenians flee their homes. Joyner, who was on the ground in Goris, whilst the humanitarian crisis was unfolding, interviewed a group of young Armenian-Australian youth, including Salbi Dilanchian, Saro Tahinian, and Natalie Marcarian, who are volunteering in the region to ""take care of Armenian people"", said Dilanchian. In addition, Joyner interviewed human rights lawyer Anoush Baghdassarian, who was on the ground in Goris and said, ""This is ethnic cleansing, so it's important to demonstrate the forced displacement of these people, to understand that this isn't a voluntary exodus."" Tom Joyner and Orly Halpern have also written an online piece titled ""Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in Russia‚Äôs backyard has exposed Vladimir Putin‚Äôs growing weakness"", discussing the unique geopolitical interests that have perpetuated fierce Azerbaijani aggression against the local Armenian population.

facebook,"Why sƒ´la-visuddhi, purity of virtue, is one of the factors for stream-entry. When your virtue is pure, it‚Äôs easy to get the mind into concentration. And what does that mean? There have been people who have reached stream-entry while standing putting food in a monk‚Äôs bowl. Some have reached stream-entry while fixing food in the kitchen. Some have reached stream-entry while gathering flowers in the garden. What does that come from? Purity of virtue. That‚Äôs when it‚Äôs not hard to get into concentration‚Äîwhen the mind is at ease. 1. When we get up and fix food, there‚Äôs no conflict among us. 2. We get the plates in which to serve the food that we‚Äôve gained in a pure way. 3. We see the monks coming for alms, and they‚Äôre pure in their virtue. Our hearts feel cheerful when we put food in their bowls. The cheerfulness of a heart when it feels at ease gives rise to purity of virtue and purity of mind. Purity of virtue is a sot‚Äôa·πÖga, one of the factors for stream-entry. It‚Äôs not all that difficult. You can reach the paths and their fruitions while putting food in a monk‚Äôs bowl‚Äîif your virtue is pure. But if your virtue isn‚Äôt pure, then no matter how much you sit with your eyes closed in concentration, all that settles down are your eyelids. Your mind is jumping out through the skin in front of your eyes and running all over the place. This is the power of defilement when the heart isn‚Äôt clean and bright. It keeps pushing the mind around so that it can‚Äôt find any peace. ~ Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo Starting Out Small: A Collection of Talks for Beginning Meditators trans. by Thanissaro Bhikkhu https://www.dhammatalks.org/ebook_index.html#StartingOutSmall",,68,"{'like_count': 46, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 16072}",The Theravada Buddhist Meditation Tradition,,2023-10-06 20:35:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/92690796_2674250602857039_220492900738269184_n.jpg?stp=c24.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=l_76vcfCvg0AX-IijR0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDHfw_rRY9ELQwQukrHHpp5aAR6LM9bq3F2EaM3Czzy4g&oe=657D57F0,https://www.facebook.com/groups/2432967426941672/permalink/3744291829142552,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385096704_3704915899790499_849740361121387103_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=11v3M99_BOwAX-PB-Ty&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA9OozW6rq_sY1zW-JTMckE70DGPleP1Yi8fChYA2qdTw&oe=6541BD1A

Parents have the responsibility and right to guide the social and moral development of their children. Parents maintain a primary role in guiding their children's education, especially when it intersects with deeply held religious beliefs. It is imperative that children can choose to opt-out of activities that do not align with their faith, without repercussions.

facebook,"15 lessons from Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization by Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright: 1. Organizations are made up of tribes. Tribes are natural groups of people who are connected to each other by a shared purpose and culture. 2. There are five levels of tribal culture. The levels are: o Life Sucks o My Life Sucks Less o Your Life Sucks o Your Life Sucks Less o Life is Good 3. Leaders can influence the level of tribal culture. By understanding the five levels of tribal culture and taking steps to move their tribe to a higher level, leaders can create a more thriving organization. 4. The first step to moving to a higher level of tribal culture is to understand the current level of culture. Leaders can do this by asking their team members questions about their purpose, values, and beliefs. 5. Once leaders understand the current level of culture, they can begin to take steps to move the tribe to a higher level. This may involve changing the tribe's purpose, values, beliefs, or behaviors. 6. It is important to be patient when moving to a higher level of tribal culture. It takes time and effort to change the culture of an organization. 7. Leaders need to be role models for the desired culture. If leaders want to create a culture of collaboration, they need to collaborate with others. If leaders want to create a culture of innovation, they need to be innovative. 8. Leaders need to celebrate successes. When the tribe achieves a goal, it is important to celebrate the success. This will help to reinforce the desired culture. 9. Leaders need to be willing to deal with conflict. Conflict is a natural part of any organization. Leaders need to be willing to address conflict in a constructive way. 10. Leaders need to be persistent. Moving to a higher level of tribal culture is an ongoing process. Leaders need to be persistent in their efforts to create a more thriving organization. 11. Tribal Leadership is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to lead a tribe will vary depending on the level of culture and the specific situation. 12. Tribal Leadership is not about magic bullets or quick fixes. It takes time and effort to create a thriving organization. 13. Tribal Leadership is about building relationships and creating a culture of trust and respect. When people feel valued and respected, they are more likely to be engaged and productive. 14. Tribal Leadership is about creating a culture of continuous learning. Tribes that are constantly learning and growing are more likely to be successful. 15. Tribal Leadership is about creating a culture of empowerment. When people feel empowered to make decisions and take action, they are more likely to be engaged and productive. I hope these 15 lessons from Tribal Leadership help you to build a more thriving organization.

facebook,"Choti Sarrdaarni Written Update, Saturday 7 Oct 2023 Kulwant says, ""What does Harleen want?"" She's concerned about what might happen if Harleen talks to Sarab. She feels the need to show Sarab that she's always there for his family. Harleen recalls a conversation with Sarab, where she expresses her frustration with his changing behavior. Dolly reassures Sarab of Harleen's love and pleads with him not to let their family break apart. Meher asks the cook what to prepare for dinner, but Harleen confronts her and demands that she choose between her brother and her unborn child. Harleen accuses Meher of breaking her trust and tries to give back jewelry and money, but Meher insists she won't take them back unless she regains Harleen's trust. Sarab is torn between his sister and wife, questioning the impact of his decision on their sibling relationship. Harleen decides to leave the house, and Sarab offers to leave instead, but Dolly intervenes, urging them to talk and find a solution. Harleen suggests dividing everything between them, causing shock and tension among the family members. Sarab agrees to divide their assets to keep his sister happy, even though Meher pleads with Harleen not to break their family. Kulwant discusses the possibility of dividing their assets among her children, while Sarab, Harleen, and Meher are still in conflict. Rovi informs Sarab that the auction papers are ready, and Harleen prepares for the division, while Meher resigns herself to the situation.

facebook,"PHC disposes of petitions against MDCAT PESHAWAR: A division bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday disposed of different petitions against the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT) after the government announced to re-conduct the exam. The division bench comprising Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Arshad Ali had earlier reserved the judgment in the case. The advocate general told the court the government after a cabinet meeting had already announced to hold the test afresh and the Khyber Medical University had been contacted in this regard. He argued that a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) had taken up a number of issues in the MDCAT that needed to be addressed. The counsel of one of the petitioners told the court that some students had scored high marks. He added that there should be a system to ensure that such students do not suffer while re-conducting the test. The court later disposed of the case citing the decision of the government to hold another test in a transparent manner. The detailed judgment will be released later. Earlier, in what appeared to be a case of conflict of interest, a key member of the JIT probing the use of Bluetooth devices and other unfair means in recently held MDCAT in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was found to be the father of a low-scoring candidate in the same test. On the basis of the JIT report, the caretaker provincial government also went ahead of its constitutional role and mandate to announce reconduct of the MDCAT test. According to sources, one candidate named Moeed Hassan, who was the son of an additional secretary in the provincial Home Department and a key member of the JIT, Maqsood Hassan, could obtain only 136 out of the total 200 marks in the test. These marks are insufficient for admission into any public or private medical and dental colleges. As per the law pertaining to the conflict of interest, this officer should not have been made a member of the important investigation team, a senior officer at the Civil Secretariat told The News. When reached for comments, Maqsood Hassan admitted that his son had appeared in the test. ‚ÄúBut, the result of the test has not yet been declared and my son has already chosen another direction for himself,‚Äù he said. The officer claimed that it was not a conflict of interest if he was made a member of the committee probing the use of unfair means in a test in which his own son had appeared. He said the JIT was about the whole process and if the government had asked him to be a part of the probe committee, it was not something unethical. The officer said the JIT had not recommended reconduct of the test but only identified loopholes and gaps in the process. A senior official in ETEA, however, said that they had already finalized the result, declared the top position holders and submitted the same to the PMDC, which would declare it along with other provinces. ‚ÄúETEA has also uploaded the solved key on the internet and every student was able to easily calculate his result from there‚Äù, he added. It is important to mention here that the JIT formed by the chief secretary had been tasked to unearth the elements involved in the unfair means, arrest them and recommend suggestions for averting use of unfair practices in future. It was none of its (JIT‚Äôs) mandate to suggest reconduct of the test, which it did in violation of its mandate. Also, the JIT was led by a police officer which is why the lapses committed by the police got no mention in the report as it was their duty to check and prevent entry of any objectionable devices into the centre. The caretaker government also asked KMU to conduct the test. Again, it was a violation of the law as under section 4 (a) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency Ordinance, 2001 it was the duty of ETEA to conduct admission tests to the educational institutions of the province. ETEA was the only testing agency in the whole country which busted the Bluetooth racket and conducted the test in a much transparent manner for which it should be awarded instead of being subjected to media trial. Dr Yasir Imran, ETEA director, told The News that the staff of the agency caught 219 candidates red-handed who were using Bluetooth and other electronic devices and handed them over to the police. He said that 470 top scorers of the test were having brilliant academic records in the Secondary and Higher Secondary School Certificates. The topper of ETEA MDCAT, who scored 198 marks in the test, has also clinched the top position in the FSc from Kohat Board in FSc too. The topper of Mardan board in FSc also scored good marks in the MDCAT. It is unfair to blame and discourage the brilliant students for the use of unfair means and force them to reappear in the test. The director ETEA said that they had identified only 168 candidates who had not done the required level of rough work on their question papers. These candidates were being investigated further. ‚ÄúThough not (truncated)",,61,"{'like_count': 15, 'comment_count': 42, 'num_users': 51446}",ETEA and MDCAT Aspirants,,2023-10-06 16:33:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/382740966_1339126193644203_7134560571586396642_n.jpg?stp=c43.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=wpD_lFZzPRYAX-7DR4-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB6hRL96MjXu5eaPuCI7UTAdyU5yWPNNVJvGCia358iyA&oe=655A75D7,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1104468893266862/permalink/2158877751159299,

facebook,"Today in Hungarian history:
On 6 October 1636 Prince R√°k√≥czi of Transylvania scatters the army of the Pasha of Temesv√°r at Nagyszalonta...

Read about the details and the political background of this military clash between the Hungarians of Transylvania and the Ottoman Empire's army, based on the research of Hungarian historians Szerecz Mikl√≥s and Szibler G√°bor...

Find out how did the Dutch Protestant powers secretly plot to make a war between their Protestant ally, the Prince of Transylvania, and the Ottoman Empire during the 30-year-war? Cardinal P√°zm√°ny's letter to King Habsburg Ferdinand reveals it.

The Dutch envoys and agents in Istambul were also instigating the Sultan against the Transylvanians in the hope of war would eventually break out between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans, as a bonus of the Transylvanian conflict. 

Being knee-deep in the 30-year-war, they wanted to split the Habsburgs' forces this way; and they didn't really care that they were betraying their ally, the Calvinist R√°k√≥czi by this.
(...)
In the end, the Dutch plotting failed though they could achieve that the Turks attacked R√°k√≥czi who defeated them in the oncoming battle of Nagyszalonta, the battle that this post is all about. 

Thus, there was no new war between the Turks and the Habsburgs because of the victory...R√°k√≥czi proved to be strong enough.

facebook,"5th October, 2023 THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF NIGERIA AND CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL JUDICIAL COUNCIL THREE ARMS ZONE FCT, ABUJA SIR, RE: PETITION AGAINST HON. JUSTICE B.M TUKUR, HON. JUSTICE OMEKA ELEKWA AND HON. JUSTICE O.A ADETUJOYE FOR DELIBERATE PERVERSION OF JUSTICE AND CONSPIRACY TO REMOVE CANDIDATES OF OUR PARTY ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT The above refers. Our attention has been drawn to a purported Petition with the above caption written by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) dated 15th September, 2023 and signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the Plateau State Chapter of the PDP. As interested parties who also sponsored candidates in the 2023 General Election in Plateau State, we are obligated to put the records straight as it is very shocking and surprising to us. This is also very clear from the content of the Petition written by the PDP against the Learned Judges of the Election Petition Tribunal in Plateau State as can be seen, no exact action of the jurists capable of perverting Justice was pointed out by the PDP aside the fact that the Judges delivered Judgments. No procedural error was pointed out to show bias, lack of fair hearing or descending into the arena of conflict. PUTTING THE RECORDS STRAIGHT The Judgments delivered by HON. JUSTICE B.M TUKUR, HON. JUSTICE OMEKA ELEKWA AND HON. JUSTICE O.A ADETUJOYE is in line with cautions and warnings that were in the public domain before the 2023 general elections, about the inescapable disaster or peril that would eventually befall the PDP in Plateau State for disrespect, continuous violation and disobedience to the Judgments and Orders of Court. Well, like it is said, ""time reveals"". But it is worrisome that the PDP are making storms at the outcome of the decisions under review. For the avoidance of doubt, it is important to note that the General Elections where members of the public go out to vote, is actually the concluding part of the electoral process. Election is a process and defect in any of the processes, renders the outcome of the secondary election, a nullity no matter how well conducted it might otherwise be regarded. The process inter alia, includes Registration of Political Parties, Congresses to elect EXCO for the Party at all levels, Conduct of Primary Elections and Qualification of both the Political Party to sponsor candidates and that of the Candidates to contest an Election. All these processes are regulated by Law and must be adhered to, stricto senso. Thankfully, the Court is the last part of the Electoral Process and that is where we are presently. The Tribunal at all levels in Plateau State have been inundated with one potent Ground of Petition by both the Labour Party (LP), Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) aside the general irregularities in the Conduct of Elections. This Ground challenges the Qualification of PDP to field in candidates to contest for elections in Plateau State while living in flagrant disobedience to Court Orders. In proving Ground One, the Petitioners relied and tendered avalanche of cases decided against the PDP as follows: 1. Certified True Copies of the Judgment in Suit No. PLD/J/304/2020- Between: Bitrus Kaze and Others Vs. PDP and Others. This is the genesis of the misfortunes of PDP. Here, the Court ordered PDP to conduct Ward, LGA and State Congresses to elect their leaders. In other words, the Court ordered PDP to form their ""structure"". Mind you, forming Political Structure is part of the Electoral Process a Political Party must fulfil. 2. Certified True Copies of Judgment Between: PDP v Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC) in Suit No. PLD/J/250/2021. Since PDP failed to obey the Order in the first case, the PLASIEC excluded PDP from participating in the Local Government Elections for not complying with the Orders of Court. The PDP filed the above case against PLASIEC and lost. PDP appealed this case to the Court of Appeal and lost on the ground that they are in disobedience to Court Order and when the PDP further appealed to the Supreme Court, they abandoned the Appeal and the Supreme Court dismissed the Appeal on the 7th December, 2022 for want of diligent prosecution. 3.

A testament to the values we uphold, Matt's decades of dedication to special operations and unwavering service to the nation perfectly align with our mission. President of the Executive Board, Mark Stephens said: ""We don‚Äôt always have the opportunity to work with people who share the same passion and investment in a real purpose. I am personally and professionally honored Matt has chosen to join our amazing team who are truly dedicated to serving the needs of our Special Operations members and their Families. We are looking forward to working with Matt as we continue to push the boundaries and increase the levels of support we provide, along with continuing to provide education on the ongoing challenges our SOF members and their Families continue to face from decades of conflict."" Sgt. Major Parrish isn't new to leadership, nor to challenges. Throughout his illustrious 20-year career in Special Operations, Matt served 13 years on Army Special Forces operational teams, completing multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and operational stints across Central and South America. Beyond combat, Matt's accolades include numerous leadership awards, service medals, and certifications in some of the world's most demanding disciplines. Elevating to the apex of the U.S. Army's enlisted ranks, Matt's commitment culminated as the Senior Enlisted Leader for the USSOCOM Preservation of the Force and Family program. In this capacity, he oversaw the human performance and wellness of over 70,000 special ops individuals worldwide. But Matt's contributions don't end there. Many have seen him perform at college and professional sporting events with the SOCOM Para-Commando parachute demonstration team. He's the voice behind SOCOM's first official podcast, SOFcast, and recently unveiled his new podcast, ""Prep For Impact."" Off the microphone, he's leveraged his military humor on Instagram's Another_SF_meme_page to champion veteran and military causes, marking him as a luminary in the veteran community. A frequent guest on various platforms, Matt's commitment to service extends beyond his professional endeavors. A loving husband and father of three, his passion for golf is only paralleled by his faith in Philippians 4:13. Join us in welcoming Matt to the Task Force Dagger family. His wealth of experience and a heart dedicated to service heralds a bright future for our foundation and the heroes we serve. #NextChapter #BigRevealSoon #Staytuned #BigNews #TFDSOF #TFD #SOF #HEAL #MISSION #PURPOSE #FOCUS #MILITARY #ACTIVEDUTY #VETERAN #SERVE #FAMILY #warfighter",,59,"{'like_count': 31, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 14314}",Task Force Dagger Special Operations Foundation,,2023-10-06 21:27:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/241552808_215523197268694_7724092124611350019_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mrIb7ADQPkwAX9_EhdB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBfexTZIPub09wvbsTbZYFlM6gmPuEjY7vC9NUup8rYiw&oe=655BB084,https://www.facebook.com/100064330465687/posts/713273167493692,
facebook,"CHAOS BOMBING by a Narcissist! Chaos is the 'go to' tool that toxic individuals use to create diversion, and confusion with their victims. it is a major form of 'supply' for them because it is power and control over individuals that they desperately need to make their desperate agenda work. From my Book: Greg Zaffuto - Author - From Charm to Harm and Everything Else in Between with a Narcissist https://www.amazon.com/Charm-Harm-Everything-Between-Narcissist-ebook/dp/B01CSR72IA/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1O2XF81O2IDV&keywords=from+charm+to+harm&qid=1691683117&s=digital-text&sprefix=from+charm+to+%2Cdigital-text%2C115&sr=1-1:=:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CSR72IA/ref=tsm_1_fb_lk Think of the many situations where you are taken from a normal day to being completely thrown off balance by one of their 'out of the blue' chaotic attacks. There is no rhyme or reason to their logic - just a 'hit and run' situation that leaves you shaking your head, shocked, silenced, withdrawing, isolated, stuck in your own head trying to reason through this, and once again diminished and managed down for no reason whatsoever. Each time you lose a little bit more of yourself and become more and more VULNERABLE because you know that any attempt to work through one of their chaotic outbursts is just futile, so you only withdraw from the situation completely. The thing we must understand is that the Narcissist is looking for this exact reaction and why they act out as they do. That VULNERABILITY of a target/victim is just an OPPORTUNITY for the Narcissist to suppress their target to inflict more of their poison, but ONLY if there are no witnesses -- so consider it as premeditated because it is. Narcissists are not inconsiderate of your feelings, to the contrary, they are extremely considerate of your feelings and they are monitoring them to see just WHERE your weaknesses are so they can inflict chaos/harm. Your feelings are exactly what they are trying to affect. They closely observe how you react every time they do something to hurt you and then they build it into their arsenal of tools to use against you in the future. Cause and effect is cognitive thinking so they know exactly what they are doing - getting the best of you to push you as close to the edge as they can! We tried to function as a normal person the best we could ‚Äì but it was a situation that was personalized and created just for us with ‚Äúdoom and destruction‚Äù in mind. YES, we tried to fix it because our lives are loaded and impacted by empathy and love ‚Äì but is that a punishable offense. Any way you look at it the target/victim somehow gets the label and the blame because the Narcissist is VERY motivated to hide their acts of chaos, crazy making, and psychological terrorism. The only way to end this type of chaos is to disallow it by disengaging completely.

A time that is marked within you scriptures as the deconstruction point of humanity. Energetically what this holds is a signature of energetic shifting that will bring humanity into a new level of receiving. . This shift is the anchor point to the New Earths manifestation process. . A time where all distortions of the 3D paradigm must surface into the collective consciousness to be rapidly transmuted into a refined expression of energy. . Until this collapse of the collective mind programs around power, dictatorship and control are released the foundational structures desiring to be birthed into the solid form through individual and collective soul missions will be unable to land anchored into the embodied reality. . This is a clearing process of what distorts these new creations that are held within the ‚Äúmind‚Äù of the collective and the molecular structure of the earth. . Over the coming weeks there will be intense elevation in consciousness, an evolvement of truth and many confused, fearful and panicked individuals. . As the acceleration of the vibrational frequency rises, more solar flare activity, toning influence, and the magnetic pull of the earth will all become that of a resonance to support this shift. . However what that means is that there will be intense downloads, awakening and insights without grounded ability to receive them. This will place many into resistances, rebellion, obsession and erratic behaviour that will create contrast and conflict in the mainstream agenda. . This is not to be seen from a lens of fixing, worry or disturbance, but to instead see that this will be present in your reality as a reminder to return to the heart, presence and grounded guidance to support. . Life as you know it is crumbling rapidly, sifting through the hands of time to bring forth what is necessary to be deconstructed from your current experience. . Please remain aware of the following: * Psychic Attach * Extraterrestrial visitation * Satantic Influences * False Light Narratives * Ego Dissolution * Transcendence of Human Attachment * Mental Illness & psychosis * Supernatural Activity * UFO sightings * Military uproar * Flooding of underground bases * Possession by entities * Uprise in Addiction and Methamphetamine * Irrational and paranoia states * Obsessive compulsive thinking * Increase in domestic violence through draconian agenda * Increase in pedolphilia narratives These are increasing in the consciousness to bring them to the surface for awareness, healing and deconstruction. To meet the shadow archetype of the ‚Äúdark masculine‚Äù and draconian consciousness for purification. We remind you with love not to be startled but to be aware and open to seeing this in a new way to find new processes within the self and relationships. You are guided, you are supported and in the realms of the unseen you are being insured the importance shifts are taking place to hold the new timeline in place. Reflect now on these questions to see your first initiation. Q. Where are you controlling others in your life for safety? Q. What is necessary to witness to allow acceptance of change? Q. Where are you denying yourself your dark masculine integration, and why? To bring awareness creates that of the initial activation into change, transmutation and healing. Expand your awareness beloveds.

facebook,"During the American Civil War, Virginia resident William Terrill Bradby was one of an estimated 20,000 Native Americans who served with Union military forces in the fight against the Confederacy. A large part of Bradby‚Äôs own contributions to the Union cause involved maritime transportation. A member of the Pamunkey Tribe, Bradby was born in Virginia in 1833. After the Civil War broke out in 1861, Bradby remained loyal to the Union even though Virginia joined the Confederacy. Bradby‚Äôs unwavering decision to side with the North resulted in his church expelling him from its congregation. Even more significantly, his military service on behalf of the Union often placed him at high risk and in harm‚Äôs way. Bradby‚Äôs initial activities with the Union forces included serving as a land guide and scout for the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign in southeastern Virginia in 1862. The following year, however, Bradby exchanged those land-based assignments for ‚Äúwater duty‚Äù when he joined the Union Navy. Throughout the remainder of the war, Bradby served on a variety of military ships and boats and even piloted several of those vessels. For a good part of 1863-64, for example, he was a pilot second class for vessels that were part of a Union flotilla on the James River in Virginia. While serving on the steamship USS Shokokon on that river, Bradby was shot in the leg by a Confederate shell. This injury turned out to be only a flesh wound, but it brought about rheumatism that would plague Bradby for the remainder of his days. Other vessels on which Bradby served were the gunboats USS Onondaga and USS Huron; the tugboat USS Epsilon; the steamship USS Daylight; and the torpedo boat USS Spuyten Duyvil. There were several other Native Americans from Virginia who likewise served the Union as guides and pilots during the war. They included Bradby‚Äôs brother Sterling as well as Thornton Allmond, John Langston, William Sampson, and Powhatan Weisiger. William Terrill Bradby‚Äôs own military record, however, is one of the most detailed and best documented of that group. After the Civil War ended, Bradby returned to where he had lived prior to the conflict: the Pamunkey reservation on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia. Bradby remained there for the rest of his life, becoming one the most respected members of the community. He died sometime around 1905",,56,"{'like_count': 43, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 55753}",Native American Blood,,2023-10-06 14:21:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/276130877_1126313238169452_8040490155062032181_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IY7xnRy0bkEAX926Ffd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD7fLHp9p9baHO_gFOsVpFExq8UvK1_sLXwA5JaoAzTIQ&oe=6559F8CF,https://www.facebook.com/100069255943741/posts/659003199751539,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385886634_659003173084875_2294401799540005719_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=TY50WDtw8T4AX9tbkTT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD0tcWaIFs3oXm4AoLmjv_TNVLxlvaIPCDC6Kuq1TQqaA&oe=65255619
facebook,"#ManipurViolence | Need PM Modi for five minutes to set the system right, says CoTU Protests erupted in Kangpokpi, Manipur, as hundreds of people gathered along National Highway-2 to denounce the recent attack at New Keithelmanbi and the alleged torching of houses by armed Meitei militants. The protest, organized by the Committee on Tribal Unity Sadar Hills Kangpokpi District (CoTU), took place at Bongmol village, and the participants made an impassioned appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit the region for just five minutes, purely on humanitarian grounds, setting aside political considerations. The CoTU's General Secretary, Lamminlun Singsit, revealed that the Meitei armed groups orchestrated the attack to create a false narrative. He stated that on the evening of October 4, around 10:30 p.m., armed Meitei groups, disguised in security uniforms, set fire to their own Meitei farmhouses at Moidangpok. This was done to make it appear as though the attack was carried out by the Kukis. Later, they indiscriminately attacked New Keithelmanbi areas in the buffer zone, but the central forces resisted their advances. Singsit clarified that the conflict that followed was between the Meitei armed groups and the central security forces, not between the Kuki Village Volunteers and the Meitei armed groups as claimed by the Meitei community. Additionally, CoTU Women Wing's Convenor, Neinu, expressed her dismay at the continuous terror perpetrated by Meitei terrorists against the Kuki-Zo community. She stated that such acts, including the recent attacks on houses at New Keithelmanbi and L. Jangnomphai village, were unacceptable and reflected the superiority complex of the majority Meitei community. CoTU's Media Cell Coordinator, Ng. Lun Kipgen, condemned the false narrative presented by the Meitei community. He emphasized that the Kuki-Zo community had remained law-abiding citizens and trusted in the legal system, even in the face of severe provocations. The protesters demanded justice, a separate administration, an end to false allegations and narratives, and swift action by the central government to restore peace in Manipur. They chanted slogans such as ""We want Justice,"" ""We want Separate Administration,"" ""Stop false allegations,"" and ""Stop false narratives."" The protesters stated the urgent need for the Prime Minister to visit Manipur and address the escalating tensions and violence in the state.",,56,"{'like_count': 23, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 66768}",Northeast Digital,,2023-10-06 18:00:52,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352517882_9444713015600383_8725161059282273910_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=igk588Df1kAAX9HJ1GF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCBuwmVInSeBxHwXCHQywajbnrjwXAtaNop4-gCK4eWWA&oe=655A398E,https://www.facebook.com/100070045776432/posts/615531297458391,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386370195_615531074125080_9116696625021501717_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=bMLUDn20hn4AX8h0yfC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDYPhW7EjGSh-1Y4atlK-7WQWfTdzzEg3Au9Idb-6sr3A&oe=652C1E5A

facebook,"I see so many people arguing when people become adults. 25 was the standard. Now people are saying it‚Äôs actually 30. All of this is based on brain development. The truth is many adults are children in adult bodies. It‚Äôs an epidemic in our culture. We don‚Äôt fully go through developmental phases. We don‚Äôt get healthy modeling. We don‚Äôt learn what it is to be an adult, emotionally. In my 30‚Äôs I sat on my couch and realized: I‚Äôm a 10 year old emotionally. I can‚Äôt directly solve (or even address) conflict. I can‚Äôt speak honestly about what I feel. I don‚Äôt even know what my needs are. Im still developing that maturity. Being an adult is really a process. It takes intentional work. It takes being uncomfortable. And of course humility to say: I need to grow here. What do you think?

facebook,"Conflict has forced these people to seek shelter in a disaster zone. As fighting rages in neighboring Sudan, hundreds of thousands have fled to parts of South Sudan already struggling to contain alarming rates of extreme hunger with limited resources. Most making this desperate journey are originally from South Sudan but were living as refugees across the border when war broke out. Returning to the country they fled years ago is not a straightforward affair. Some families arrive at crowded transit centers with children who are fighting for their lives due to severe malnutrition. They then have to make multi-day treks by boat and overland transport just to reach temporary shelters.

He told me how in the trenches, he'd get the lice out of the seams of his uniform and then crackle them in a tobacco tin over a candle. On a more sombre note, he also described witnessing British soldiers coming under heavy machine gun fire and how they sheltered behind a small wooden chicken shed, even though the bullets were passing through it as though it wasn't there. The soldiers froze there without a vestige of protection in vain hope. They didn't survive.

facebook,"So some one had a post up asking if space marine's ever ran out of ammunition. I was typing up a reply when they deleted it. Not upset at them or anything but I put a little effort into the reply and don't want to waste it so I'm taking over the discussion! Here's my reply, finished. In lore, yes a space marine can run out of ammo. Even their backpack power generators can run out and shut down leaving the marine in a very bad situation. MOST marines cannot move in their power armor with out it being powered. The thing a lot of people don't understand about marines is their shock troops. Their suppose to suddenly and unexpectedly hit an enemy REALLY REALLY HARD and break their lines for Imperial Guard to come in and take over a majority of the fighting. When marines are on ""extended"" deployments, they are never far from base or a convoy of resupply vehicles such as Rhino's carrying spare ammunition. With Thunder hawks and Drop pods, resupplying marines even in the most grueling battlefields like on Armaggedon is easier then you might expect as well. For those of you familiar with Halo, something like an Ordinance pod wouldn't be too far out of the question. We even see a mechanic similar to this in Space marine the game with the ""shipping containers"" full of weapons and ammunition, and the ""vaults"" where you can pick up a new weapon for the first time. Either one can very easily be dropped by a Thunder hawk where ever its needed. Since we only really have to go off is the games... Space Marine depicts a marine carrying 330 rounds of ammunition when full. This is 30 rounds in the gun itself, and 10 spare magazines. US Riflemen serving in the Army carry 7 magazines as spares + 1 in their weapon for a total of 240 rounds of ammunition. So not drastically unrealistic to have a few extra magazines. Many armies also have a member of the squad dedicated to carrying more ammunition for the unit. Typically this is for Light and Heavy machine gunners who carry a few belts of ammo for their weapon, and a ""Assistant gunner"" will carry extra ammunition for the gun along side their own gear. With Auxiliary Roles such as Chaplains, Apothecaries, Librarians, ect.... Its not hard to imagine such a thing might exist for space marines as well. Take the Heavy Bolters backpack attachment, modify it a bit to carry say, 50 spare mags of ammo. Done deal. Attaches to any backpack, extends field deployments for the marines in area's of expected heavy conflict. Some old lore even suggested that Bolters would have a belt ammunition feed and backpack supply, though I think this has been retconned now. The point to note how ever is US soldiers are trained primarily for accuracy over volume of fire from everything I have been told. Space marines.... are always depicted as firing on Fully Automatic. Looking to the Space Marine Movie... as terrible as it was.... a marine would run out ammunition VERY VERY quickly by comparison. Going back to the Video Game, Space Marine taking place on a forge world, with an Imperial Guard regiment, there is tons of ammunition laying around because the Guard do use Bolters, Typically heavy, for gun emplacements. So its not hard to argue that a space marine can ""scavenge"" for ammunition If friendly forces are in the area and orbital resupply is unavailable. How ever I feel the more realistic depiction of how Space marines would fight comes from the fan videos, ""The Raptor"" and ""Astartes"" where their shown as firing short, controlled bursts if not single shots to devastating effect. Much like US soldiers, this would make their ammunition supplies last MUCH longer then ""spray and pray"" full auto fire as shown by official sources. Add onto the this that every marine in lore carries at least a combat knife if not a Chain sword. They may choose to use a melee weapon over expending ammunition, especially when they are against a foe with melee only, or they have a change to surprise their foe by dropping on them from above or from around a corner. Tactical marines might not charge into gun fire, but if they got around a fortification and into a bunker where the soldiers operating a heavy machine gun only have pistols if anything for a weapon outside of that machine gun, it would be a prime opportunity for the marine to use his melee over his ammunition. What makes this worse though than RL... Soldiers in RL can pick up weapons and use their enemies equipment in dire situations. If a space marine did this, he would likely be killed by his fellow marines, either during the act or afterwards, as we have seen even numerous times. ESPECIALLY when fighting Chaos and even the ammunition can cause corruption or lead to possessions. The only time you might see this behavior is if Space marines are fighting each other or the Guard, which has also happened in lore. Going onto energy weapons, as Id be remissed not too. They are said to draw from the suits power supply, at least from what I remember.

facebook,"Long before Europeans came up the Kennebec River to the ""head of the tide"" Algonquian-speaking Indians, considered Wabanaki or ""People of the Dawn"" were already here. As early as 1607 the area was explored by English settlers from the short-lived Sagadahoc or Popham Colony at the river‚Äôs mouth. Representatives of Plymouth Colony were the first English to actually live here. In 1625, on a river expedition to find a place to trade agricultural products for Indian furs, Plymouth pilgrims chose the east shore for their ""House at Kennebeck"". The post, probably built in 1628, was operated by the original traders and, later, by Plymouth Company with varying degrees of success, until it was abandoned some time between 1669 and 1676. There were French as well as English influences here in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1646, a Jesuit priest, Gabriel Dreuillettes, visited ""an English settlement named Kinibeki"" and established a mission nearby for the Kennebec natives. It was then that the term ""Cushnoc"" (""Coussinoc"" or ""Kouissnoc"") first appeared in reference to the Plymouth trading post. (Cushnoc means ""Head of Tide"") After years of conflict involving the French, Indians, and English and several decades during which Kennebec settlements were deserted, the Kennebec Proprietors, successors to the Plymouth Company, erected Fort Western near the Cushnoc site. Located below the falls at the head of navigation, the fort was intended as a supply depot for Fort Halifax, 17 miles upriver. The proprietors also initiated efforts to settle the region. When military staffing was no longer needed, Captain James Howard, who had commanded the fort, stayed on as the first permanent settler. The fort‚Äôs main building served as a residence and a store. The village called ""the Fort"" was the upriver part of the town incorporated as Hallowell in 1771. In February, 1796, the Fort residents petitioned the Massachusetts Legislature for permission to build the first Kennebec bridge. Although ""the Hook,"" as the lower Hallowell village was called, wanted the bridge on its shore, the Fort request was granted. The following February, in 1797, the legislature approved separation of the Fort from Hallowell. Incorporated first as Harrington, the new town changed its name to Augusta on June 9, 1797. In 1799, Augusta became the shire town of the newly formed Kennebec County. In 1827, the town was designated the capital of Maine, which had entered the union in 1820 as the 23rd state. The Maine Legislature met here for the first time in January, 1832. Augusta was chartered as a city in 1849. I've always been sad and upset what we and the whole country did to the Natives!",,52,"{'like_count': 32, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 7134}","Augusta, Maine - A Capital Happening",,2023-10-06 01:19:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/304546157_562492922262757_5212527902478498719_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tLDyzH5Pzu4AX_VRCNU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCMsFk2QT-xZpwOCi6wGZ0vW2hpWw4AsNb9P1RQz6SQPg&oe=655AEF76,https://www.facebook.com/100055061633276/posts/855853712926675,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/383995810_855853662926680_5234406038987911645_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=AJLxcppj4kcAX-HR-Ec&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD4XQUWg3WUu_1iiJ8ci09iu6Ms8hhCVp2cBoYk9TZAWA&oe=6541CA5F
facebook,"It is said that a Jacobella, a loving wheaten, ventured far from the plains to bring her  journey to see Blowing Rock and the care of a squaw mother. One day the wheaten Jacobella , daydreaming on the craggy cliff, spied a Cherokee brave wandering in the wilderness far below and playfully shot an arrow in her direction. The flirtation worked because soon he appeared before her wigwam, courted her with songs of his land and they became lovers, wandering the pathless woodlands and along the crystal streams. One day a strange reddening of the sky brought the brave and the maiden Jacobella to The Blowing Rock. To him it was a sign of trouble commanding his return to his tribe in the plains. With the maiden‚Äôs entreaties not to leave her, the brave, torn by conflict of duty and heart, leaped from The Rock into the wilderness far below. The grief-stricken maiden Jacobella prayed daily to the Great Spirit until one evening with a reddening sky, a gust of wind blew his lover back onto The Rock and into his arms. From that day a perpetual wind has blown up onto The Rock from the valley below. For people of other days, at least, this was explanation enough for The Blowing Rock‚Äôs mysterious winds causing even the snow to fall upside down.",,52,"{'like_count': 29, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 29788}",Wheaten Greetin,,2023-10-06 00:51:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/399473326_10228102162712276_2415742319569697870_n.jpg?stp=c28.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=KlAODX2NTXsAX80UhWq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBo2nm59L41XNLs7b5WGu9PpxfWSznKGy2905LQFv8WUA&oe=655B6622,https://www.facebook.com/groups/520579581681318/permalink/1613116879094244,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387176658_848109517029271_9114572278313807276_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=QdG5Ir40UFcAX_8qgtR&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAgRLjKj4TQrMp0WRtRVVvZk6_34sU145RIqhNaXllt3w&oe=65250404

facebook,"SAINT BRUNO OF COLOGNE October 6, 2023 Saint Bruno is believed to have been born into the wealthy and influential Hardeb√ºst family in the city of Cologne, in modern-day Germany. His family‚Äôs status would have ensured him a good education and a successful career. As a teenager, he was sent to the prestigious Cathedral School of Rheims, in the Kingdom of France, about 200 miles from his hometown. After completing his studies, he returned to Cologne where he was made a canon at Saint Cunibert Church. It is most likely at that time that he was ordained a priest. In 1056, when Canon Bruno was about twenty-six years old, he was called back to Rheims by the bishop, given a canonry at the Cathedral, taught at the School of Rheims, and was later made rector of the school. These distinctions speak to his character, holiness, and intelligence. Canon Bruno spent the next twenty-plus years in this capacity, after which time he was made chancellor of the Archdiocese of Rheims. While he was chancellor, a corrupt and worldly man named Manass√®s of Gournay was made Archbishop of Rheims. The honest canons firmly opposed the archbishop‚Äôs ways, and Canon Bruno led the way. The archbishop was deposed by a local council, but he appealed to the pope and became violent toward his opposition. Around this time, Bruno left Rheims, probably for Rome, until the matter was resolved. Finally in 1080, the pope deposed the archbishop, and there was a cry from the clergy and laity to appoint Bruno as the next archbishop. Bruno, however, had other plans. He resigned from his prestigious positions in Rheims and set out to answer God‚Äôs call to a new life. Bruno is believed to have first traveled about 100 miles south to Molesme where he met with a monk and future founder of the Cistercian order, Saint Robert. After a short stay, he decided to travel farther south with six companions to found a new order under the authority of Bishop Hugh of Ch√¢teauneuf, Bishop of Grenoble. Bishop Hugh welcomed Bruno and his companions and told them about a dream he had in which he saw God build a house in the desert for His glory with seven stars showing the way. The bishop believed the seven men were the stars in his dream, so he enthusiastically supported their new mission. With the bishop‚Äôs support, Bruno and his companions traveled into the mountain country called Chartreuse, where they built hermitages and embraced a radical life of prayer, study, and manual labor. Peter the Venerable, an abbot of Cluny, later described their early life this way: ‚ÄúThere, they continue to dwell in silence, reading, praying, and also undertaking manual work, especially in the copying of books. Within their cells, at the signal given by the church bell, they perform part of the canonical prayer. For Vespers and Matins, they all gather in church. On certain days of celebration they depart from this pace of life‚Ä¶They then have two meals, they sing in church all the regular hours and all, without exception, take their meal in the refectory.‚Äù Bruno enjoyed about six years of solitude in Chartreuse when, in 1090, he was called to Rome by the pope. Pope Urban II, who was elected pope in 1088, found himself in serious conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor and Antipope Clement III. Pope Urban was Bruno‚Äôs former student and called on him to become a counselor to assist with the chaos. Bruno obediently went to the aid of Pope Urban, serving him quietly and personally within the Lateran Palace in Rome. Shortly after his arrival, however, the Holy Roman Emperor took Rome by force, and Bruno and Pope Urban had to flee. Around the year 1091, Pope Urban wanted to make Bruno the Archbishop of Reggio, but Bruno once again opposed the idea and the pope chose another. After pleading to return to his hermitage in Chartreuse, the pope agreed to allow him to found a new hermitage in Italy so he was closer and could be called upon if needed. He and some companions settled in the wilderness of Calabria where they built a hermitage named Sainte-Marie-de-la-Tour. Of this new life, Bruno wrote in a letter, ‚ÄúI am living in the wilderness of Calabria far removed from habitation. There are some brethren with me, some of whom are very well educated and they are keeping an assiduous watch for their Lord, so as to open to him at once when he knocks.‚Äù Bruno died in this hermitage a decade later. Though Bruno never formally wrote a rule for his newly-founded order, he did leave them a way of life. Twenty-six years after his death, statutes were written down that guided their monastic-heremitical vocation. Bruno was quickly considered a saint, but in keeping with their hidden vocation, the order never formally petitioned the pope to canonize him. Over the next five hundred years, the Carthusians grew to 198 monasteries with about 5,600 members. In 1514, during a general chapter of the order, a request was made to Pope Leo X to confirm Bruno‚Äôs merits and authorize a liturgical feast for the order.

It also lets us learn more about how apes operate when there‚Äôs no human-animal conflict to be concerned about, like how they use tools, how they use space, and their group dynamics. This type of research allows us to determine what an untouched environment provides for wildlife, and it also helps us make a case for protecting places like Goualougo so more species may thrive. Additionally, it helps us figure out how to be as un-invasive as possible when encroaching on space that animals have been using, free of humans, for a very long time. Having a long-term research camp in this area also means being able to make change in a positive way for both local human and animal communities that will last over generations.

facebook,"üá≤üá´ üá≥üá± Orange (principality) country The Principality of Orange (French: principaut√© d'Orange, Dutch often also principality), is a small former principality of the Holy Roman Empire, currently located in Provence, a region in southeastern France. In Dutch it was historically referred to as Oranghien and later further Dutchified as Oranje. It was initially a county and after 1163 a principality that remained independent until 1713. To the west it was joined by the Rhone River separated from France; on all other sides it was enclosed by the Comtat Venaissin. It was officially declared a French territory at the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. From 1731 it belonged to the French province of Dauphin√©, until it was abolished in 1789. Comt√© d'Orange Principaut√© d'Orange 8th century ‚Äì 1713 Kingdom of France (1589‚Äì1792) ‚Üí The principality is named after the place Orange, a town in the Vaucluse, on the left bank of the Rh√¥ne, twenty kilometers north of Avignon. The territory of the principality measured approximately 19.31 by 14.48 km, or 279.71 km¬≤. It was therefore almost the same size as the island of Bonaire, or about one and a half times the size of the island of Texel. The current municipality of Orange covers approximately a quarter of this area. History Orange has a history dating back to Roman times . History of Orange House Orange According to tradition, the first Count of Orange is William with the Horn, a courtier of Charlemagne, who is said to have conquered the city of Orange from the Saracens in 793. As the only part of the ancient Kingdom of Burgundy, the county had belonged to the Holy Roman Empire since 1032. The house of counts split into two lines in 1150, one of which was elevated to the royal position by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1163. House Les Baux After the death of Raimbaud III of Orange, the area of this last branch belonged to her husband Bertrand I of Les Baux via his sister Tirburge III of Orange. The area of the count's branch was initially ceded to the Order of Saint John, but Bertrand III of Les Baux reunited the whole of Orange in 1308. House Chalon After the death of Raymond V of Les Baux, Prince of Orange, his daughter Maria inherited the principality. Through her husband John III of Chalon it passed to the house of Chalon and, with the death of the last member of this family, Philibert, to his nephew Ren√© of Chalon, the son of his sister Claudia and Hendrik III of Nassau-Breda. Under Ren√© of Chalon, Orange was occupied several times by France as a bone of contention between Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire and King Francis I of France. Because he also remained childless, he appointed his cousin William of Nassau with the approval of Emperor Charles V as successor. This decision contradicted the contents of the will of Mary of Baux, who had brought the principality of Orange into the House of Chalon. In the absence of male heirs, the principality would have to go to the heirs of her daughter Alix of Chalon. Alix's daughter Margarita married Rudolf of Baden-Hochberg (1427-1487) in 1449. Their only surviving granddaughter Johanna of Neuch√¢tel (d. 1543) of son Philip (1452-1503) married Louis I of Longueville (1480-1516) in 1504. Their descendants were pretenders to Orange until this family became extinct in the male line in 1694. This family protested against the hereditary law after 1544 and immediately took it to court. Given the important position of William the Silent as leader of the revolt against Spain, the French kings decided that the court's decisions would not be followed through and left the principality to the Nassaus (1580-1713). Orange William the Silent, later stadtholder in various Dutch regions, became Prince of Oranghien in 1544 and founded the Orange-Nassau dynasty - but was only able to exercise real power over the principality since 1559. Orange was also occupied several times under his rule. After his death, it fell to his sons, Philip Willem, Maurits and Frederik Hendrik. The latter's heir was William II, who was succeeded by William III in 1650. After the outbreak of the Dutch War (1672), Louis XIV occupied the principality. Willem got it at the Peace of Nijmegen (1678) returned, but it was taken again in 1685 when the Edict of Nantes was revoked. The Peace of Rijswijk (1697) definitively restored him to princely dignity. After the death of William III in 1702, a succession conflict broke out between Johan Willem Friso of Nassau-Dietz and Frederick I of Prussia. The former - as grandson of Frederik Hendrik's daughter Albertine Agnes - was designated as successor by will. However, Frederik I, as the son of Frederik Hendrik's eldest daughter Louise Henri√´tte, also laid claim to the principality under Frederik Hendrik's will. Meanwhile, Louis XIV declared the principality of Orange abdicated to the French throne. The Parliament of Paris assigned the principality to Louis's pretender, Francis Louis of Bourbon-Conti.

facebook,"15 lessons from Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization by Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright: 1. Organizations are made up of tribes. Tribes are natural groups of people who are connected to each other by a shared purpose and culture. 2. There are five levels of tribal culture. The levels are: o Life Sucks o My Life Sucks Less o Your Life Sucks o Your Life Sucks Less o Life is Good 3. Leaders can influence the level of tribal culture. By understanding the five levels of tribal culture and taking steps to move their tribe to a higher level, leaders can create a more thriving organization. 4. The first step to moving to a higher level of tribal culture is to understand the current level of culture. Leaders can do this by asking their team members questions about their purpose, values, and beliefs. 5. Once leaders understand the current level of culture, they can begin to take steps to move the tribe to a higher level. This may involve changing the tribe's purpose, values, beliefs, or behaviors. 6. It is important to be patient when moving to a higher level of tribal culture. It takes time and effort to change the culture of an organization. 7. Leaders need to be role models for the desired culture. If leaders want to create a culture of collaboration, they need to collaborate with others. If leaders want to create a culture of innovation, they need to be innovative. 8. Leaders need to celebrate successes. When the tribe achieves a goal, it is important to celebrate the success. This will help to reinforce the desired culture. 9. Leaders need to be willing to deal with conflict. Conflict is a natural part of any organization. Leaders need to be willing to address conflict in a constructive way. 10. Leaders need to be persistent. Moving to a higher level of tribal culture is an ongoing process. Leaders need to be persistent in their efforts to create a more thriving organization. 11. Tribal Leadership is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to lead a tribe will vary depending on the level of culture and the specific situation. 12. Tribal Leadership is not about magic bullets or quick fixes. It takes time and effort to create a thriving organization. 13. Tribal Leadership is about building relationships and creating a culture of trust and respect. When people feel valued and respected, they are more likely to be engaged and productive. 14. Tribal Leadership is about creating a culture of continuous learning. Tribes that are constantly learning and growing are more likely to be successful. 15. Tribal Leadership is about creating a culture of empowerment. When people feel empowered to make decisions and take action, they are more likely to be engaged and productive. I hope these 15 lessons from Tribal Leadership help you to build a more thriving organization.

facebook,"Why is the FEAST of the OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY, on every October 7th? 
..... The story of the  VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY at the Battle of Lepanto, on OCTOBER  7, 1571.

IN TIMES OF ACUTE DANGER AND HARDSHIP, WE MUST ALWAYS FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD AND TURN TO THE RECITATION OF HER HOLY ROSARY. The Battle of Lepanto is a great lesson of confidence for us today. 

When Saint Pius V became Pope, Christendom faced the perils perhaps unequaled in its history of continual conflict with the violent followers of Mohammed. All the information and intelligence that Pope Pius V had been gathering indicated that the Ottoman juggernaut was about to roll across the Mediterranean and adjacent lands, spearheaded by the Turkish fleet, with Italy and Rome as one of its target. (The Ottoman Empire is also historically known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire)

Only Spain and Venice had the resources to resist, and they hated each other along with deep mistrust. Yet Saint Pius ‚Äî calling down divine grace as only a man of prayer could ‚Äî forged an alliance with them as the core of an organized fleet of over 200 galleys. With his considerable tact and diplomatic skills, he not only kept them unified, but he convinced them to attack the enveloping menace.

The Archbishop of Mexico had an exact copy of the HOLY IMAGE OF THE LADY OF GUADALUPE sent to King Philip II, who in turn gave it to Andrea Doria, one of the three principal admirals of the fleet, who placed it in his cabin. When the Armada went from file to line abreast and attacked on the morning of OCTOBER 7, 1571 the blue standard of OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE was also flying from the masthead of Don Juan‚Äôs flagship. 

Pope Pius V, a Dominican prelate before becoming a Pope, did what Catholics have always done in times of acute danger: FLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOTHER OF GOD. As a follower of Saint Dominic, HE KNEW THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF IMPLORING HER HELP WAS THROUGH THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY. He ordered all monasteries and convents in Rome to increase their prayers for the impending battle and organized ROSARY PROCESSIONS in which he, as sick as he was, participated. OUR LADY‚ÄôS PRESENCE THAT DAY WAS MORE ACUTELY FELT THROUGH THE HOLY ROSARY.

As the Christian fleet sailed toward the great clash, MASS WAS CELEBRATED AND THE ROSARY RECITED DAILY ON EACH VESSEL‚Ä¶.. THIS HEARTFELT REQUEST FOR DIVINE ASSISTANCE RESULTED IN A CRUSHING DEFEAT OF THE OTTOMANS AT LEPANTO THAT ENDED THEIR DOMINANCE AND CRUELTY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. OCTOBER 7, 1571, WAS THE VICTORY OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY, EVEN IF THE CHRISTIAN FLEET WAS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE OTTOMAN FLEET.

TO CELEBRATE OUR LADY‚ÄôS INTERCESSION AND VICTORY, THE CHURCH HAS DESIGNATED OCTOBER 7 AS THE FEAST OF OUR LADY OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY. Similar acknowledgement to the Blessed Virgin‚Äôs intercession through the Rosary were made when John Sobieski forced the Turks to lift the Siege of Vienna in 1683 and after the victory of Prince Eugene of Savoy at Temesvar in his successful campaign to remove the Ottomans from Europe in the next century.",,45,"{'like_count': 23, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 313049}",üíùThe Blessed Sacramentüíù,,2023-10-06 15:40:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/273697806_3178498479138985_8703205382825898916_n.jpg?stp=c0.6.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=M4Q35uP7ZI8AX8WeNUF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfATKV1wPSENiU2mtHxoKjxCCReEiTYCyEn6UW9V8wVEWw&oe=6559D8CB,https://www.facebook.com/groups/367620301465991/permalink/708424630718888,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386786913_6622074261203396_5928534652368284138_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=Qg0P94W8ylIAX9sFoJO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCNTKI1pWNU0ePVQvu8_kfkzFpLjoa5fBVRrQVBT5-K3g&oe=6524553F

facebook,"Raise of hands üôãüèªif smartphones have ever been a topic of worry and/or conflict between you and your teen. The teen years are a time of developing identity and independence üí™. Even if we don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs totally normal for teens to push back against boundaries and resist parental influence. But they still need their parents!! Especially when it comes to things like learning to use technology üì± in ways that enrich, rather than hinder, their life. Asking questions‚ùîlike these from Brooke Romney Writes can be a great place to start. They (1) show our teens we‚Äôre on their side and (2) help them consider their phone usage for themselves! üëâAs you find natural ways to bring up these questions (not all at once!), you set the stage for offering support and guidance while helping your teen take charge of their own screen time. Bonus tip: Teens are often more willing to open up about things like this if it‚Äôs not a direct, face-to-face conversation. Try going for a drive or going out for ice cream for some casual but quality together time.

facebook,"Zoutleeuw. Het systeem op de Kleine Gete werkte in de glorietijd maar werd letterlijk een pest in de moeilijke jaren. In 1573 brengt een overstroming niet alleen de pest in de stad maar veroorzaakt ook veel schade aan de gebouwen. Sinds 1578 krijgt de bevolking het zwaar te verduren van een groot Spaans garnizoen dat in de stad wordt gelegerd. De Spanjaarden zetten grote delen van het landschap onder water met armoede en ziekte als gevolg door het verlies van weiden en pachthoven. In de 17de eeuw komen daar nog eens een drietal grote stadsbranden bovenop. Ondanks de in 1671 gebouwde citadel wordt het stadje in 1678 en 1701 door de troepen van Lodewijk XIV bezet en geplunderd. De geschiedenis van Zoutleeuw is een goed voorbeeld hoe een klein stadje en zijn burgers lijden kunnen onder de veroveringsgrillen van grote Europese machten. Na de stad bezet en geplunderd te hebben in 1678 moeten de Fransen nog datzelfde jaar de macht weer aan Spanje overdragen als gevolg van de ‚ÄòVrede van Nijmegen‚Äô die een einde maakt het conflict tussen Frankrijk en de Republiek der Zeven Verenigde Provinci√´n. Maar zeven jaar later, in 1705 wordt de stad met zware beschietingen opnieuw veroverd, ditmaal door de geallieerde Engels-Hollandse troepen onder bevel van John Churchill, hertog van Marlborough. Vanaf 1715 brengt het einde van de Spaanse Successieoorlog de stad onder Oostenrijks-Habsburger bewind samen met de rest van de zuidelijke Nederlanden. Dat brengt tijdelijk rust en zelfs weer wat welvaart tot aan de Franse revolutie maar betekent onder het bewind van Keizer Joseph II wel het einde van talrijke plaatselijke kloosterorden. Tot aan die Revolutie blijft de stad strategisch belangrijk als grens met het prinsbisdom Luik maar als de Fransen Brabant en Luik annexeren valt dat belang weg. Dat heeft de stad na de revolutie goed gedaan want onder Koning Willem I kan er opnieuw gehandeld en ge√Ønvesteerd worden in burgerlijke goederen en diensten en niet alleen in het militaire. Het verzoek om de verzande Gete opnieuw bevaarbaar te maken wilde de koning echter niet inwilligen. Bij de onafhankelijkheid van Belgi√´ moet de stad wel zijn stadstitel inleveren en die hebben de Zoutleeuwers pas in 1985 teruggekregen. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ [https://ernstguelcher.blogspot.com/2021/09/op-stap-in-zoutleeuw.html](https://ernstguelcher.blogspot.com/2021/09/op-stap-in-zoutleeuw.html)",,44,"{'like_count': 29, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 2379}",Ge zijt van Zoutleeuw als ge...,,2023-10-06 16:21:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/155064758_5262550423785219_3171328838572439531_n.jpg?stp=c25.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=zRXLJ3u91awAX_HKzMv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCimsX1X_GyszTU-MynezJiwj27YFBCK7SK6eDy0BJpIg&oe=657D2FB8,https://www.facebook.com/groups/141038514541415/permalink/697259392252655,

Thank you all.* ‚úÖ Free & New ‚úÖ Ongoing ‚úÖ Daily Updates ‚úÖ Strong, sassy female lead -‚éΩ__‚éΩ-‚éª‚é∫‚é∫‚éª-‚éΩ__‚éΩ--‚éª‚é∫‚é∫‚éª- ‚ùóSome words and sentences have been changed / removed entirely to keep this post facebook appropriate ‚ùó ""What happened here?"" the Beta demanded, his gruff voice low and authoritative. He was a tall, muscular man with graying hair and his long years of wisdom reflected in his eyes. ""Fenrir ‚Äì he's gone,"" I croaked, barely able to utter a sound. Selene, carrying Fenrir's unborn child, stepped forward. ""I have been fulfilling the duties of Luna for a long time now,"" she declared. ""I believe I should lead the pack, with the assistance of our loyal beta and gamma, until our son is old enough to become the Alpha."" ""Lyla,"" one of the elders spoke up, his voice strong, ""you were the true fated mate of Fenrir, and by shifter law, that makes you the rightful Luna of this pack."" Rylan nodded in agreement, his gaze unwavering. ""The Moon Goddess chose Lyla to be Fenrir's mate,"" he added, ""and it stands to reason that she was meant to be the Luna of this pack."" As the night sky glimmered above, I inhaled deeply, ready to face whatever fate had in store. I was no longer a weak human, bound to an Alpha's cruelty. I was Lyla, the water elemental, the Luna of the pack‚Ä¶no, the Alpha of the pack‚Ä¶and I would be up for any challenges that came my way. I would shape a new path for myself and all members of Silvermoon. -‚éΩ__‚éΩ-‚éª‚é∫‚é∫‚éª-‚éΩ__‚éΩ--‚éª‚é∫‚é∫‚éª- Days earlier: Struggle. It has become my constant companion, etched into my very being like the trials that mark my flesh. Darkness enveloped me as I sat in the dimly lit room, my body shivering from both tension and cold. For years, I had endured the relentless cruelty of Alpha Fenrir, my mate. I was nothing more than his human captive, a pawn in his twisted game of power. The collar around my neck was proof of his claim over me. Fenrir returned after leaving me alone all day, and his arrival brought an air of impending doom. As he grabbed the chain leash that adorned my neck, pulling it with force, I fell to my knees to the floor. I hissed in anger at being treated this way, which he ignored. ""Follow me,"" he commanded, his voice laced with malice. ""Try to keep up and don't be a burden on me, Lyla."" My spirit refused to be broken, even in the face of a truly horrible beast as himself. ""The only burden in this room is you to me,"" I mustered the strength to retort, but my defiance only earned me a harsh response. He yanked me back to my feet and pulled the leash, leading me through the cold stone corridors to a makeshift hospital within the pack's stronghold. Inside, injured warriors from the recent battle were tended to, their wounds telling the tales of the conflict they endured. In the center of the room stood a well, a lifeline to my elemental powers. This well, built directly into the building, was a source of both strength and despair for me. Fenrir's voice echoed coldly as he demanded I heal his warriors, preparing them for the next battle in the ongoing war with a rival pack. My heart cried out in protest. I loathed using my water elemental powers; they had brought me nothing but terror throughout my life. Many different kinds of people, both human and supernatural, sought me out for these very powers, seeking to exploit me for their own gain. I glanced down at the necklace around my neck, the Moon's Tear, my most cherished possession. It was an intricate piece, bestowed upon me by my mother, who had loved me dearly before fate took her away. The necklace served as a reminder of the strength and resilience I once possessed. With a heavy heart, I agreed to Fenrir's command, knowing that if I refused, the consequences for myself and the pack would be dire. Drawing upon my abilities, I called forth a substantial amount of water from the well, and with precision, I manipulated it to rest gently on the warriors' wounds, coaxing them to heal. Each healing was a draining task, both physically and emotionally, but I pushed through, fueled by the hope that my actions might save these lives. -‚éΩ__‚éΩ-‚éª‚é∫‚é∫‚éª-‚éΩ__‚éΩ--‚éª‚é∫‚é∫‚éª- [#fantasyfiction](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/fantasyfiction?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVKvlnfHMaoPeaAHKg2jQHrjiaI1KfxZJsWH2L-uiz2XpUBejqLYPamk1PgBVJzuANnrN2YuvYQvl3Ni9TagRCvGX6ZroATx78XGCSFD4kjsLucb7P54GB31FczsOMEfhPyfdyFkCXjXrYU9oZhOAC4&__cft__[1]=AZVKvlnfHMaoPeaAHKg2jQHrjiaI1KfxZJsWH2L-uiz2XpUBejqLYPamk1PgBVJzuANnrN2YuvYQvl3Ni9TagRCvGX6ZroATx78XGCSFD4kjsLucb7P54GB31FczsOMEfhPyfdyFkCXjXrYU9oZhOAC4&__tn__=*NK-R]-R) (truncated)",,44,"{'like_count': 19, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 1991949}",Dreame Official Fan Group,,2023-10-06 01:34:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/322137312_669964211589172_2358298083586211_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CNGP8jyeAygAX9uEhM9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDBukZgCi8ftDO1p5GdcD4PRxCzt6UHP_KyuSLQJi4ARw&oe=655A37CB,https://www.facebook.com/groups/313813773557936/permalink/868624618076846,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/384098795_147274598461463_6022806169628041956_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=yF6DshlIdk4AX-kFXc1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBfAp2hzOAGCpiTszmyVKUevJzFbw-WRC0kqPT9sKtI1g&oe=6524373D

facebook,"TINGNAN | KAGAMITANG PANDIGMA NG NPA NASAMSAM NG 80IB SA ISANG ENGKWENTRO SA QUEZON

BARAS, RIZAL ‚Äì Umabot sa 30 minuto ang sagupaan sa pagitan ng mga elemento ng 80th Infantry (STEADFAST) Battalion, 2nd Infantry (Jungle Fighter) Division, Philippine Army at ang humigit kumulang na 20 miyembro ng New People‚Äôs Army o NPA na mga miyembro ng KLG NARCISO, Sub-Regional Military Area 4A ng Southern Tagalog Regional Party Committee sa pamumuno ni Janice Javier alyas Yayo, Secretary ng KLG Narciso at Jordan Mopon alyas Boyong, Platun leader habang nagsasagawa ng focus military operations sa Sitio Imawang, Barangay Lumutan, General Nakar, Quezon Setyembre 27, 2023.

Malaking tulong sa hanay ng kasundaluhan ang mga impormasyon mula sa mga mamamayan upang masubaybayan at tuluyan nang mawakasan ang armadong rebolusyon ng CPP-NPA-NDF sa probinsya ng Rizal, Bulacan, at Quezon. Ito ay nagresulta sa isang engkwentro sa pagitan ng mga kasundaluhan at armadong grupo ng NPA at pagkakarekober ng mga kagamitang pandigma ng armadong grupo tulad ng rifle grenade, M16 short magazine, mga bala, mga subersibong dokumento at personal na kagamitan.

Matatandaan sa mga nakalipas na taon, sinimulan ng mga kasundaluhan ng 80IB sa tulong ng iba‚Äôt ibang ahensya ng gobyerno ang programa o ang pagsasagawa ng malawakang Local Peace Engagement (LPE) o pagbabalik-loob ng mga dating miyembro at sumusuporta sa teroristang  CPP-NPA-NDF at pagbubuo ng people‚Äôs organization. Isa na rito ang Barangay Lumutan na sinuportahan ng Pamahalaang Bayan ng General Nakar, Quezon at netong buwan lang isinakatuparan ang pagkakaroon ng livelihood project, ang Eco-Tourism Park & Campsite sa naturang Barangay. Ito ay nagpapakita lamang na ang mga mamamayan ng Rizal, Bulacan at Quezon lalung lalo na sa Barangay Lumutan ay mulat na sa mga maling idelolohiyang ipinapakalat ng mga makakaliwang grupo at nais na nilang matamasa ang isang tunay na mapayapa at maunlad  na pamayanan na malayo sa presyensya  ng CPP-NPA-NDF.

Muli, patuloy parin ang panawagan ng pamahalaan sa mga natitira pang mga miyembro ng NPA na bumaba, isuko ang kanilang mga armas at talikuran ang mga maling idelolohiyang pinaglalaban na nagdudulot lamang ng kapahamakan. Ang gobyerno ay palaging bukas palad at nakahandang tumanggap sa lahat ng gustong magbalik-loob upang makasama nilang muli ang kanilang mga mahal sa buhay.

facebook,"Malignant meaning, evil in nature or effect, being around narcissists often has many negative effects on you, from emotional, mental, physical, financial, psychological and spiritual. As far as I‚Äôm aware, The malignant Narcissist isn‚Äôt an official diagnosis. The term was coined by psychologist Erich Fromm, who was a German Jew and fled the Nazi regime and settled in the USA he describes the malignant as. ‚ÄúThe most severe pathology and the root of the most vicious destructiveness and inhumanity‚Äù. Signs of a malignant narcissist. Evil in nature or effect. Superficial charm. Relentlessly aggressive. Pathological liar. Sadism. Deliberately causing suffering to others. Antisocial behaviour. Little to no empathy. Zero responsibility. No remorse. Extreme envy. Abrupt mood swings. Superior. Arrogant. The most pathological and, hurtful of all narcissists, they have no sense of their inner worth, meaning they are full of rage and extremely vindictive, they are extremely dangerous and will stop at nothing to harm others, they are extremely unstable and often unstoppable, they will encourage others to fight on their behalf, they are incredibly impulsive, they have no empathy or guilt, taking lots of rash hurtful actions towards others, they have an excessive rage within themselves. They have the ability to change reality for millions of people, their crazy internal reality, makes those around them believe the narcissist‚Äôs crazy reality, in the millions if allowed to do so. They have no limits, and there is nothing they will not do to serve themselves. The malignant narcissist is extremely arrogant and self-centred. They have a very fragile, super-sensitive ego. They need to convince all others just how special they are, in order to feel better about themselves, they might not be aware of their sensitive ego, often they feel threatened in some way real or perceived. Hence, they just believe others are against them and do all they can to seek revenge on those the narcissist perceives to have turned against them. The malignant narcissist is extremely envious and are pathological at holding grudges against others. They hate seeing others with something they haven‚Äôt got, or something they want, most often assuming it‚Äôs down to pure luck that others have achieved, the malignant narcissist can be pathological in trying to destroy someone they themselves are envious of. The malignant narcissist has that sense of entitlement like most narcissists. They believe they are superior to others; not only do they expect to be treated as superior they often demand to be treated as superior. They believe they are entitled to do what they want, whenever they want, with whoever they want and whatever they want, as they believe they are above all others. The malignant narcissist often has no empathy. Many actually get pleasure out of harming others, a complete lack of genuine compassion. They can act empathetically if they have Cognitive Empathy. They will show fake empathy to others, to deceive those around them in order to protect themselves, to get enablers and flying monkeys to protect them. People either love and respect them or genuinely fear them both will carry out their demands. The malignant narcissist will exploit all others to get their needs met, with no thoughts or feelings to how it affects those around them. They need power and control and achieve this by coming across as a great saviour to people in the beginning. They will go all out to protect their enablers, not to protect their enablers in order to protects themselves, by getting enablers to feel obligated into defending and protecting the narcissist. The malignant can show signs of antisocial behaviour. These are pathological liars. They have an unprovoked hostility and aggression towards others that they will blame on others. They can look for trouble, even pre-planning it. They will set others up for a fall, they will create drama and could conflict in those around them. They have volatile mood swings, they cheat, steal and lie, they believe they are above the law and are extremely dangerous and toxic. The malignant narcissist can show signs of Paranoia. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt trust those around them, because of how they think, they are extremely suspicious of all those around them, and believe all others are out to get them. The malignant narcissist is extremely manipulative. These don‚Äôt wait to see an opportunity to manipulate others, although they will use an opportunity. They actively create opportunities, they genuinely go around looking for those they can take advantage of, they plan, and they plot to win at any and all costs to those around them. The malignant can show signs of sadism they will deliberately cause, harm, suffering, pain and distress to others, often showing hatred. They enjoy seeing people, animal, anything suffers. They will knowingly inflict pain and suffering on those around, to gain control of others, or to just feel (truncated)",,43,"{'like_count': 17, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 141699}",Elizabeth Shaw - Overcoming Narcissistic Abuse,,2023-10-06 09:00:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/131895058_221441146207822_6660154306512556918_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=rnMkyJ51OfIAX8mEWXy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfChr_bnBm0QEb_rsfDF5LhC7zKGne-mJ2Vwy0oXt-YXWQ&oe=657D16E4,https://www.facebook.com/100050258149317/posts/930946738590589,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/17693395608906773755?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdy7glz37jgl0b.cloudfront.net%2Fbrand%2Fbetterhelp%2Fbetterhelp-fb.png%3Fv%3D0177f73d2461&fb_obo=1&utld=cloudfront.net&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbGTHGpz814UkSlqi96KP9mCb5jTq9ioNiWIzQt9cJDh3w&oe=6521C776

facebook,"Callie Eh, Malaysian / Swiss Photographer, born 1972 Color of Life: Blue Series, Handprint (Morocco) Fine Art Photography Born and raised in Malaysia, currently based in Switzerland. Her travels have inspired her to capture life with photography. What started off as a hobby, capturing special moments of her time around new cities and environments eventually evolved into a career she never foresaw coming. This very passion drove her to use the camera to express and deliver narratives previously unseen and untold. For her, photography became more than a way of creating memories. ‚ÄãPhotography has been a tremendous support for Callie and It has been a refuge for Callie during difficult times and a safe space to explore a multitude of emotions concerning love, conflict, and hope. Callie‚Äôs works mostly refer to life ‚ÄúIn the moment‚Äù. She captures people to reveal honesty and express the authenticity of their individuality, heritage, and life. The raw power of her images makes us want to know more about the subjects, their life, and their personal stories. ‚ÄãARTIST STATEMENT For me photography was a life-saver. It picked me up at a difficult time in my life and I have not let it go ever since. Originally from Malaysia, I have lived in various countries and I am now based in Switzerland. Photography has changed my view of the world and has made me see things differently. I like to mix genres but my greatest photographic passion right now is documentary photography, inspired by my travels, the people I meet, the different cultures and the different ways of life",,41,"{'like_count': 26, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 136352}",A CELEBRATION OF FEMALE ARTISTS,,2023-10-06 15:03:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/396963602_3699287400300326_7035825126309722014_n.jpg?stp=c0.9.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=J5q2vca4KYwAX_zIcYL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfATogUDIGqS7uG04ZSjVo4_5em9qdEKVBm2445ydxM_VQ&oe=655A8111,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1080475609511196/permalink/1348406066051481,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386558596_6148464648587028_4828873973041335951_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=aa7Jcpw7WBQAX8Ha63r&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCvFZv2cmLX70o4zTi9Ufh0GEtYIdlWzkJRmKFISJKCKw&oe=65259147

Kenojuak Ashevak, CC ONu RCA (October 3, 1927 ‚Äì January 8, 2013) is celebrated as a leading figure of modern Inuit art. 

Kenojuak Ashevak was born in an igloo in an Inuit camp, Ikirasaq, at the southern coast of Baffin Island. Her father, Ushuakjuk, an Inuit hunter and fur trader, and her mother, Silaqqi, named Kenojuak after Silaqqi's deceased father.

Kenojuak remembered Ushuakjuk as ""a kind and benevolent man."" Her father, a respected angakkuq (shaman), ""had more knowledge than average mortals, and he would help all the Inuit people.‚Äù  According to Kenojuak, her father believed he could predict weather, predict good hunting seasons and even turn into a walrus. Her father came into conflict with Christian converts, and some enemies assassinated him in a hunting camp in 1933, when she was only six.

After her father's murder, Kenojuak moved with her widowed mother Silaqqi and family to the home of Silaqqi's mother, Koweesa, who taught her traditional crafts, including the repair of sealskins for trade with the Hudson's Bay Company and how to make waterproof clothes sewn with caribou sinew.

When she was 19, her mother, Silaqqi, and stepfather, Takpaugni, arranged for her to marry Johnniebo Ashevak, a local Inuit hunter. Kenojuak was reluctant, but in time, she came to love him for his kindness and gentleness, a man who developed artistic talents in his own right. 

In 1950 a public health nurse arrived in her Arctic village; Kenojuak, having tested positive in a tuberculosis screening, was sent against her will to Parc Savard hospital in Quebec City, where she stayed for over three years, from early 1952 to the summer of 1955. She had just given birth when she was forcibly transferred; the baby was adopted by a neighbouring family. Several of Kenojuak's children died while she was confined in hospital.

In 1966, Kenojuak and Johnniebo moved to Cape Dorset. Many of their children and grandchildren succumbed to disease, as did her husband after 26 years of marriage. Three daughters of Kenojuak, Mary, Elisapee Qiqituk, and Aggeok, died in childhood, and four sons, Jamasie, her adopted son Ashevak, and Kadlarjuk and Qiqituk. The latter two were adopted at birth by another family.

The year after Johnniebo died in 1972, Kenojuak remarried, to Etyguyakjua Pee; he died in 1977. In 1978 she married Joanassie Igiu. She had 11 children by her first husband and adopted five more; seven of her children died in childhood. At the time of her death from lung cancer, she was living in a wood-frame house in Kinngait (Cape Dorset).

Kenojuak Ashevak became one of the first Inuit women in Cape Dorset to begin drawing. She worked in graphite, coloured pencils and felt-tip pens, and occasionally used poster paints, watercolours or acrylics. She created many carvings from soapstone and thousands of drawings, etchings, stonecut prints and prints ‚Äî all sought after by museums and collectors. She designed several drawings for Canadian stamps and coins, and in 2004 she created the first Inuit-designed stained-glass window for the John Bell Chapel in Oakville, Ontario. In 2017, the $10 bill released in celebration of Canada's 150th birthday features Kenojuak's stone-cut and stencil printed work called ""Owl‚Äôs Bouquet"" in silver holographic foil.

During Ashevak's stay at Parc Savard hospital in Quebec City, 1952 to 1955, she learned to make dolls from Harold Pfeiffer and to do beadwork. These crafts later attracted the attention of civil administrator and pioneer Inuit art promoter James Archibald Houston and his wife Alma. Houston introduced print-making to Cape Dorset artists in the 1950s, and he and his wife began marketing Inuit arts and crafts, including an exhibit of Inuit art in 1959.

By 1959 Kenojuak and other Cape Dorset Inuit had formed the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative as a senlavik (workshop) for aspiring Inuit artists, later known as Kinngait Studios.

In 1963 she was the subject of a National Film Board documentary: Eskimo Artist: Kenojuak, about Kenojuak, then 35, and her family, as well as traditional Inuit life on Baffin Island. The film showed a stonecutter carving her design into a relief block in stone, cutting away all the non-printing surfaces; she would then apply ink to the carved stone, usually in two or more colours, and carefully make 50 ""shadow"" prints for sale. With the money she earned from the film, Johnniebo was able to purchase his own canoe and become an independent hunter to help provide for the family, which now included a new daughter, Aggeo, and an adopted son, Ashevak.

The work of Ashevak Kenojuak can be found in the collections of Canada's National Gallery, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Burnaby Art Gallery.

Kenojuak became the first Inuit artist inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2001, and traveled to Toronto with her (truncated)",,41,"{'like_count': 21, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 7636}",Suquamish Community,,2023-10-06 17:53:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.18172-8/15994560_10156003432934848_6158917397633887309_o.jpg?stp=c12.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=pRO2I_ZQLh0AX_OMW1_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCYZh8BT0Sh562saytTtbin0HWReZBOF50xQ1vQipWdbg&oe=657D33EB,https://www.facebook.com/groups/46929309247/permalink/10161052581909248,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385048522_10227989171948786_5865078509164134339_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=T0czETognD4AX-3GVW6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDtz5PHpwMHeYJzvsmi1VMH09CXV2luPclCaYsPFxPHpg&oe=652D4CAD

facebook,"zojuist ontvangen in de mail ;-) Beste partijgenoot, Afgelopen weken heeft het dagelijks bestuur van de Partij voor de Dieren een zorgvuldige en intensieve procedure doorlopen, conform onze meldregeling, om tot een standpunt te komen ten aanzien van de meldingen van vermeende integriteitsschendingen die tegen Esther Ouwehand zijn gedaan. Mede op basis van advies van externe deskundigen, is het dagelijks bestuur tot de conclusie gekomen dat Esther Ouwehand geen integriteitsschendingen heeft begaan. We zullen deze conclusie nader toelichten. Allereerst merken we op dat meldingen van vermoedens van integriteitsschendingen normaliter in volledige vertrouwelijkheid moeten worden behandeld, zodat in alle rust uitvoerig onderzoek kan worden gedaan. We betreuren dat er beschuldigingen van integriteitsschendingen in de openbaarheid zijn geuit. Dit heeft de partij en Esther Ouwehand schade toegebracht. Ook was dit een inbreuk op het onschuldprincipe. Bovendien werd hierdoor de gehele procedure onder grote druk gezet. In het kader van de vertrouwelijkheid kunnen we niet op de exacte inhoud van de verschillende meldingen ingaan. We kunnen wel in algemene termen beschrijven wat er is gebeurd en welke procedures daarbij zijn gevolgd. Op 27 september heeft onze integriteitssecretaris negen meldingen tegen Esther Ouwehand overgedragen aan onze voorzitter. Deze meldingen waren alle afkomstig van leden van het voormalige partijbestuur. E√©n van deze meldingen was gedaan op 30 augustus, zeven van deze meldingen werden gedaan op 14 september en √©√©n melding werd gedaan op 27 september. Conform de meldregeling is het in de eerste plaats aan de voorzitter om een standpunt in te nemen over meldingen. Hij kan zich laten bijstaan door leden van ons dagelijks bestuur. Dat is in dit geval gebeurd. Zij kunnen zich verder laten bijstaan door externe deskundigen. Daar hebben zij in dit geval ook voor gekozen. De eerste stap in het beoordelen van de meldingen is de ontvankelijkheidstoets. De functie van deze toetsing is om te voorkomen dat ieder conflict in de vereniging via de meldregeling wordt uitgevochten. De meldregeling is bedoeld als een laatste redmiddel voor serieuze vermoedens van integriteitsschendingen die niet op een andere manier bespreekbaar gemaakt kunnen worden. Bij het formuleren van een standpunt heeft het dagelijks bestuur zich laten bijstaan door een externe deskundige die is gespecialiseerd in verenigingsrecht. Zij hebben gezamenlijk geconcludeerd dat acht van de negen meldingen niet-ontvankelijk waren en de negende deels niet-ontvankelijk was. Concreet wil dat zeggen dat deze meldingen volgens de meldregeling niet in behandeling kunnen worden genomen. Vaak was dit omdat een gedraging niet onder de reikwijdte van een gedragsregel viel of omdat de melder de beklaagde redelijkerwijs had kunnen, of nog kan, aanspreken. E√©n melding werd als gedeeltelijk ontvankelijk beoordeeld. Deze melding bleek echter niet gegrond. Dat wil zeggen dat, hoewel de melding binnen de reikwijdte van de regeling paste, er geen sprake bleek van een integriteitsschending. Uit oogpunt van zorgvuldigheid en gelet op de grote belangen heeft het bestuur daarna twee externe deskundigen op het gebied van integriteit om een second opinion gevraagd. Deze stap gaat verder dan de meldregeling voorschrijft. Zij hebben voor hun oordeel een triage uitgevoerd. Daarbij zijn zij uitgegaan van de (hypothetische) veronderstelling die maximaal recht doet aan de positie van de melder, door blind uit te gaan van het waarheidsgehalte en de ontvankelijkheid van de melding. In die context hebben ze de vraag beantwoord: als de door de melder beschreven handelingen precies zo hebben plaatsgevonden als beschreven, zou er dan inderdaad sprake zijn van een integriteitsschending? Zij concludeerden dat in geen van de meldingen sprake was van enige integriteitsschending. Dezelfde conclusies gelden voor de medewerker van de Tweede Kamerfractie tegen wie √©√©n van de meldingen ook was gericht. Het bestuur concludeert ook dat er door het voormalige bestuur op een oneigenlijke manier is omgegaan met de eigen meldprocedure. Zowel de bestuurlijke lijnen als de integriteitsregelingen zijn aan een stevige professionaliseringslag toe. Het bestuur heeft naar aanleiding van de recente gebeurtenissen ook besloten zo snel mogelijk een externe integriteitssecretaris aan te stellen. Al langere tijd bestond er een verschil van inzicht over de professionalisering van de Partij voor de Dieren tussen enerzijds het voormalige partijbestuur en anderzijds de partijleider en een groot deel van de lokale en regionale volksvertegenwoordigers en afdelingsbestuurders. De meldingen die tegen Ouwehand zijn gedaan zijn door hun timing en strekking onmiskenbaar een escalatie geweest om dit verschil van inzicht te beslechten. We willen en gaan nu verder vooruitkijken. Als bestuur zullen wij aan de slag gaan met de verdere professionalisering en democratisering van onze prachtige beweging.

Idinepensa ni Vice President at Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Sara Duterte ang kontrobersyal na proposed confidential funds ng kanyang opisina. Sa nagdaang selebrasyon ng 122nd Police Service Anniversary ng Police Regional Office 13 na ginanap sa Butuan City nitong Miyerkules, October 4, iginiit ng bise presidente ang kahalagahan ng confidential funds para sa seguridad ng bansa. Binigyang diin ni VP Sara na kung sinuman ang kumokontra sa confidential funds ay kumokontra sa kapayapaan at kung sinong kumokontra sa kapayapaan ay kalaban ng bayan. Nabanggit rin ni VP Sara ang pagiging miyembro ng DepEd sa Anti-Terrorist Council pati na rin sa National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict bilang patunay ng ‚Äúunwavering commitment‚Äù ng ahensya para maprotektahan ang mga mag-aaral, mga guro, at iba pang stakeholders nito. Pinalagan naman ng Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) ang pahayag ni ito ng Pangalawang Pangulo. Binigyang diin ng Bayan na isang mapanganib na paraan ng pag-iisip ito ng Bise Presidente. Ayon kay Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes, ngayon lang sila nakarinig na ang paghingi ng transparency at pananagutan ay ituturing nang banta sa kapayapaan at seguridad. Ikinabahala ni Reyes ang takbo umano ng pag-iisip ni VP Sara dahil hindi naman aniya nangangahulugan na ang pagtutol sa confidential fund ay isa nang pagpapakita ng suporta sa isang maling gawain. Matatandaang kamakailan lang nang magdesisyon ang Kongreso na alisin ang pinagsamang P650-million confidential funds ng Office of the Vice President at DepEd na pinamumunuan ni VP Sara para sa 2024 at ilipat ito sa ahensyang nakatutok sa West Philippine Sea. Bago ito, nauna nang maging usap-usapan ang confidential funds nang aminin ni Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo na nagastos ng OVP ang P125-million confidential funds nito noong 2022 sa loob lamang ng 11 araw, taliwas sa naunang report na 19 araw.

facebook,"PESHAWAR: A division bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday disposed of different petitions against the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT) after the government announced to re-conduct the exam. The division bench comprising Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Arshad Ali had earlier reserved the judgment in the case. The advocate general told the court the government after a cabinet meeting had already announced to hold the test afresh and the Khyber Medical University had been contacted in this regard. He argued that a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) had taken up a number of issues in the MDCAT that needed to be addressed. The counsel of one of the petitioners told the court that some students had scored high marks. He added that there should be a system to ensure that such students do not suffer while re-conducting the test. The court later disposed of the case citing the decision of the government to hold another test in a transparent manner. The detailed judgment will be released later. Earlier, in what appeared to be a case of conflict of interest, a key member of the JIT probing the use of Bluetooth devices and other unfair means in recently held MDCAT in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was found to be the father of a low-scoring candidate in the same test. On the basis of the JIT report, the caretaker provincial government also went ahead of its constitutional role and mandate to announce reconduct of the MDCAT test. According to sources, one candidate named Moeed Hassan, who was the son of an additional secretary in the provincial Home Department and a key member of the JIT, Maqsood Hassan, could obtain only 136 out of the total 200 marks in the test. These marks are insufficient for admission into any public or private medical and dental colleges. As per the law pertaining to the conflict of interest, this officer should not have been made a member of the important investigation team, a senior officer at the Civil Secretariat told The News. When reached for comments, Maqsood Hassan admitted that his son had appeared in the test. ‚ÄúBut, the result of the test has not yet been declared and my son has already chosen another direction for himself,‚Äù he said. The officer claimed that it was not a conflict of interest if he was made a member of the committee probing the use of unfair means in a test in which his own son had appeared. He said the JIT was about the whole process and if the government had asked him to be a part of the probe committee, it was not something unethical. The officer said the JIT had not recommended reconduct of the test but only identified loopholes and gaps in the process. A senior official in ETEA, however, said that they had already finalized the result, declared the top position holders and submitted the same to the PMDC, which would declare it along with other provinces. ‚ÄúETEA has also uploaded the solved key on the internet and every student was able to easily calculate his result from there‚Äù, he added. It is important to mention here that the JIT formed by the chief secretary had been tasked to unearth the elements involved in the unfair means, arrest them and recommend suggestions for averting use of unfair practices in future. It was none of its (JIT‚Äôs) mandate to suggest reconduct of the test, which it did in violation of its mandate. Also, the JIT was led by a police officer which is why the lapses committed by the police got no mention in the report as it was their duty to check and prevent entry of any objectionable devices into the centre. The caretaker government also asked KMU to conduct the test. Again, it was a violation of the law as under section 4 (a) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency Ordinance, 2001 it was the duty of ETEA to conduct admission tests to the educational institutions of the province. ETEA was the only testing agency in the whole country which busted the Bluetooth racket and conducted the test in a much transparent manner for which it should be awarded instead of being subjected to media trial. Dr Yasir Imran, ETEA director, told The News that the staff of the agency caught 219 candidates red-handed who were using Bluetooth and other electronic devices and handed them over to the police. He said that 470 top scorers of the test were having brilliant academic records in the Secondary and Higher Secondary School Certificates. The topper of ETEA MDCAT, who scored 198 marks in the test, has also clinched the top position in the FSc from Kohat Board in FSc too. The topper of Mardan board in FSc also scored good marks in the MDCAT. It is unfair to blame and discourage the brilliant students for the use of unfair means and force them to reappear in the test. The director ETEA said that they had identified only 168 candidates who had not done the required level of rough work on their question papers. These candidates were being investigated further. ‚ÄúThough not proven yet, if they are for the time (truncated)",,39,"{'like_count': 18, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 58912}",MDCAT-ETEA Updates 2023-24,,2023-10-06 10:45:20,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/308783068_177027931511993_2178341013037050442_n.jpg?stp=c15.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=OfKCUmB7hbkAX8fzXtV&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCJ0xkbTA_YYS9gJn0HJpgDgj-y3aJo0ruk1nFb7Ox3qw&oe=655BA0D5,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1417296505413674/permalink/1658630754613580,

facebook,"Friday evening we begin the holiday of Shemini Atzeres. Shemini means ‚Äúeighth,‚Äù and Atzeres means ‚Äústop.‚Äù On this eighth day and last day of the holiday of Sukkos, Hashem asks us to stop. The Sages teach that the holiday of Sukkos has been like a celebration that the King throws for His entire kingdom. At the very end of the festival, all of the guests say their goodbyes and head home. But the King detains His beloved children and says ‚Äú◊ß÷∏◊©◊Å÷∏◊î ◊¢÷∏◊ú÷∑◊ô ◊§÷º÷∞◊®÷µ◊ì÷∑◊™÷∞◊õ÷∂◊ù, ◊¢÷∑◊õ÷º÷∞◊ë◊ï÷º ◊¢◊ï÷π◊ì ◊ô◊ï÷π◊ù ◊ê÷∂◊ó÷∏◊ì/Your departure is difficult for me; stay one more day‚Äù (Rashi on Numbers 29:26). The Sages teach that from this we learn how precious we are to Hashem. But the Lubavitcher Rebbe takes the lesson further. It is not possible for us to depart from Hashem, the Rebbe notes, because He is One and everywhere. Therefore, wherever we go, He is there and thus there is never a departure. What does it mean, then, when He tells us that our departure is difficult for Him? What is difficult for Hashem, the Rebbe teaches, is that we BELIEVE that we are departing from Him. We are not conscious of His infinite Oneness, and therefore we suppose that it is possible to be distant from His presence. If so, then what good will one additional day do? If we have not come to understand Hashem‚Äôs unity by now, then how will one more day help? But this additional day of Shemini Atzeres is no ordinary day. It is a ‚Äú◊ô◊ï÷π◊ù ◊ê÷∂◊ó÷∏◊ì/yom echad/a day of Oneness‚Äù when we will stop and focus all of our energies on internalizing the reality of Hashem‚Äôs absolute unity. Afterwards, though we leave the palace and go on our way, there will be no departure because we will understand that there is nowhere we can go where He is not. To take it one step further, the Rebbe teaches that Hashem‚Äôs statement ‚Äúyour departure is difficult for me‚Äù refers not only to our departure from Him - for as we have seen, we cannot ever truly depart from Him. Rather, what is difficult for Hashem is our distance and separation from ONE ANOTHER. ‚Äú◊§÷º÷∞◊®÷µ◊ì÷∑◊™÷∞◊õ÷∂◊ù/pridaschem‚Äù means not only ‚Äúyour departure,‚Äù but your division, or divisiveness. The acrimony and conflict among His children pains Hashem deeply. He therefore implores us to remain together one more day in order to meditate on our inherent indivisibility. It is time for us to stop - to stop fighting with one another, to stop focusing on our differences, to stop and listen to one another and realize that though we may have diverse ideas, stories, and beliefs, we have far more in common than we imagine or admit. On Shemini Atzeres, we stop and contemplate our Universal singularity. Afterwards, we join hands and dance together on Simchas Torah in circles. We dance this way because the circle has no head and no tail, no leader and no follower. We dance as one because this is the ultimate lesson that the Torah was given to teach us: that G-d is One, that we are one, and that our very purpose is to go forth from the King‚Äôs palace and spread the awareness of this Oneness throughout the entire creation. - Derived from Pnei Hashem, an introduction to the deepest depths of the human experience based on the esoteric teachings of Torah. www.pneihashem.com",,39,"{'like_count': 21, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 26284}",Wisdom in the Torah,,2023-10-06 12:24:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/26220219_1810910765868768_3997198001595616271_n.jpg?stp=c10.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=SO9lWyToXrIAX-Z23PM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBpypZ2OO2seyBe26MIEf5o07e7YhUhs-gnjRqdbjm2cA&oe=657D264C,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1420456141410458/permalink/6390096317779724,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385776858_329063996383957_2043794457240162334_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=uKeRi0pCo2AAX-FypEP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDYNZk3w3TBlGekiDY4Zs7d_HawyHSS1Kyjf9bJ8TsxwA&oe=6524CAFC

facebook,"The very 1st prophecy in the Bible is at Genesis 3:15. ‚û• Genesis 3:15 "" I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel."" This ""enmity"" between the serpent & the Woman plays out in Revelation 12."" The serpent bruised Christ's heel by killing Him on His 1st Coming. The wound was temporary however with Christ's resurrection! Christ will bruise the serpent in the head when the serpent is cast into the Lake of Fire at the end of His 1,000 year reign at Revelation 20:10. Post Content Summary: (scriptures listed below) ‚û• Revelation 20:7-10 - Serpent bruised in the head by destruction in the lake of fire. ‚û• Ezekiel 39:11-13 - Serpent (Gog) bruised in the head by death and burial! ‚û• Revelation 12 - Serpents conflict with the Woman & her seed during Christ's 2nd Coming. ‚û• Genesis 3 - The 1st Prophecy! ---------------- Serpent bruised in the head by destruction in the lake of fire. ‚û• Revelation 20:7-10 7 And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison 8 and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. 9 And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, 10 and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. Same event described in Ezekiel 38-39. Gog (the Serpent) gets a burial! ‚û• Ezekiel 39:11-13 11 ""On that day I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers, east of the sea. It will block the travelers, for there Gog and all his multitude will be buried. It will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog. 12 For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order to cleanse the land. 13 All the people of the land will bury them, and it will bring them renown on the day that I show my glory, declares the Lord GOD. ---------------- Serpents conflict with the Woman & her seed during Christ's 2nd Coming. ‚û• Revelation 12 (ESV) 1 And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. 2 She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth. 3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems. 4 His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child he might devour it. 5 She gave birth to a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for 1,260 days. Satan Thrown Down to Earth 7 Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back, 8 but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. 9 And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world--he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. 10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, ""Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. 11 And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. 12 Therefore, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!"" 13 And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 14 But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. 15 The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood. 16 But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth. 17 Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus. And he stood on the sand of the sea. ---------------- The 1st Prophecy! ‚û• Genesis 3 (WEB) 1 Now the serpent was more (truncated)",,37,"{'like_count': 26, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 282709}","Book of Revelation Church, Bible Study & School by RevelationScriptures.com",,2023-10-06 12:27:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/44052535_1855266481259929_7428696209641963520_n.jpg?stp=c43.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=LgCY4ioGSNgAX8ZnUVS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBZhMvjHj-n9SfT9BTmHS_-bs4RUKXspdIjCajwkC0M6g&oe=657D2140,https://www.facebook.com/groups/247127822356816/permalink/1811065949296321,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385775245_6585175491602314_1846949140582502797_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=_IVelTGcTIUAX8VZW1T&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDkemMBZL_gtUqEK7K_SA-XoYaNFUp9uAntk8FPQRl1SQ&oe=652496E9

facebook,"MY EX, MY PAST (I MARRIED MY EX) By Adebowale Olaoye. 1B Fola's love for Christ was unwavering, but she also yearned for a husband. She had attended countless Christian singles' events, relationship group meetings, grasped the principles of healthy relationships, fasted, and prayed diligently. Yet, no man seemed willing to commit to her. She felt the weight of her age, especially when her mother called and questioned when she would bring a man home. The pressure had led her to settle for Gbenga, a known womanizer who was now pressuring her for sex, as if their entire relationship hinged on it. Gbenga believed he had made significant efforts. He had followed her severally in name of attending church, but he lacked the commitment to a devout Christian life. He simply wasn't ready for the perceived monotony of a born-again lifestyle. Their relationship had become a battleground over the issue, and, as usual, Gbenga had prevailed. Fola had reluctantly allowed intimacy to enter their relationship, and he had left her feeling empty once more, emotionally and physically. In the wake of their encounter, Fola grappled with a mix of emotions. She still longed for a husband, but Gbenga's actions had left her questioning whether he was the right man to fulfill that desire. As she sat alone, tears welled up in her eyes, and she wondered if there was more to life than this tumultuous relationship. She pondered whether she should continue down this path or muster the strength to break free and find the love and commitment she truly deserved. The uncertainty weighed her down as days turned into weeks, and Fola found herself in a constant state of internal conflict. She knew she deserved better than the rollercoaster ride she was on with Gbenga. Her faith in God remained unshaken, but her faith in the future of their relationship had eroded. As she attended church services, she sought solace in her prayers, desperately seeking guidance and God's forgiveness. Fola had always believed in the power of prayers. Gbenga's thoughts were also in turmoil. He realized that he had paid a price for his actions, not just in the strained relationship with Fola, but also in his own inner turmoil. His desire for physical intimacy had driven a wedge between them, and he had begun to question the emptiness that followed each encounter. One evening, after a particularly heated argument with Fola, Gbenga found himself alone in his apartment. The echoes of their words still rang in his ears. He knew he had to confront his own demons and decide whether he wanted to continue down this destructive path. As for Fola, she found strength in her faith and the support of her church community. She decided to have a heart-to-heart conversation with Gbenga, one last attempt to salvage their relationship. She longed for a love that was built on trust, commitment, and mutual respect. Their future remained uncertain, but both Gbenga and Fola stood at a crossroads, each grappling with their own desires, doubts, and the possibility of redemption. TO BE CONTINUED!

Parentification is sometimes known as ""growing up too fast."" It typically occurs when a youngster assumes parental duty for their siblings or even their parents, physically, intellectually, or emotionally caring for a sibling or parent. This can harm a child's mental health and lead to long-term mental health issues like depression and anxiety. 

Parentification occurs when children provide physical and emotional care that exceeds their developmental abilities and capability.

When parents push their emotional demands on their children and seek emotional and mental support from them, this is referred to as emotional parentification. Emotional parentification is thought to be the more complex and difficult for the child of the two forms.

Instrumental parentification is comparable to emotional parentification and frequently occurs together. Instead of solely attending to their parents' emotional needs, children who engage in instrumental parentification are assigned jobs and obligations that are inappropriate for their age group. This could include food shopping, meal preparation, bill payment, caring for sick siblings or parents, and other activities.

While we wish to give our children more responsibilities, parents remain in charge. The children do not make the final decisions. Because parents have the final say, the weight of the decision and its implications falls on the adult, not the child, even if the child is a teenager. Children should be permitted to express their ideas and opinions, but they are not the head of the household.

We nurture our children to become adults. If parents build co-dependent connections with their children to the point where children are expected to never leave or accomplish everything required of them, they will be unable to be themselves. If children believe they cannot be themselves, they will undoubtedly take on the burden of other people's sentiments.

A child's bond with his or her parents is unique. You may want them to disclose all of their secrets so you can help them, but that can't happen if you're disclosing stuff you shouldn't. There are a few issues you should probably avoid discussing with your child as if they were your best friend, such as a marital problem. This is not to say that parents should not be honest and vulnerable, but if a child does not believe their parent can take care of themselves emotionally, it will be difficult to believe they will be taken care of as a child.

Parentification, or children taking on parental roles and responsibilities, is a difficult topic to discuss because cultural standards vary even within the same country. Furthermore, some families have situations or just function in ways that need children to take on additional tasks. Parents and carers are sometimes simply doing what they know or need to do to survive.

Parentification trauma refers to the detrimental impact that parentification can have on a child. It most commonly arises when a youngster is expected to take on the job of a parent without the appropriate assistance or resources to do so effectively.

Symptoms differ depending on the situation. The symptoms will be more severe if the case of parentification is severe. Among the most common symptoms are:
‚Ä¢  Stress and anxiety 
‚Ä¢  Stomachaches or headaches 
‚Ä¢  Aggression 
‚Ä¢  Academic troubles 
‚Ä¢  Social difficulties 
‚Ä¢  Trouble maintaining friendships 
‚Ä¢  Inability to enjoy age-appropriate activities 
‚Ä¢  Neglect of their own needs and feelings 
‚Ä¢  Feelings of self-blame and self-doubt 
‚Ä¢  Anger and depression over the loss of childhood in teenagers and adults 
‚Ä¢  Substance abuse 

Other indicators of parentification include serving as a mediator between parents, receiving compliments from strangers on being mature or responsible, hesitating to express emotions owing to fear of a parent's reaction, and feeling emotionally mature than a parent.

A child is typically parentified when a parent is unable to fulfil their own function as a parental figure for a variety of reasons. Among these causes are:
‚Ä¢  Divorce 
‚Ä¢  Chronic illness, disability, or a death in the family 
‚Ä¢  Alcoholism or drug addiction 
‚Ä¢  Physical or mental abuse by a partner 
‚Ä¢  Sexually predatory tendencies (sometimes directed at the child)

facebook,"I searched previous posts in our group before posting this. I would like to get some advice, and/ or perspectives in case this happens to me. - A friend of mine got hit by a car, he flew off onto the car window. - The driver was very sorry, said that he is also a cyclist, etc. so they could exchange driving licenses and contacted ICBC about that and told my friend not to worry. - 2 other cyclists and 1 pedestrian stopped to check on my friend and offered witnessing. My friend who was dazed at that moment did the worst thing - he told witnesses that he would be fine and he didn't take their contact info. My friend said the driver seemed like a good man so he thought it's unnecessary. - My friend reported to ICBC in case of injury. He felt the pain but powered through and tried to move on cause he said nothing broken. - My friend received the bill from ICBC of $3k++ with the reason that he suddenly cut into the car lane with no shoulders check and cause the broken windshield of the car. - My friend said it's not the case: he did check the behind - the car was far behind, made hand signal, finished the merging, stopped in the lane waiting as previous cars cause the red light was on; it's the driver that was speedy and didnt stopped on time. - ICBC said my friend was getting into the car lane so he had to make sure it's safe to do so - by default he was seen as cutting in front of the car improperly. Unless he can prove he did turn back to check. The fact that my friend waived witnesses was so ignorant. But I struggle to understand ICBC conclusion and how it can be the verdict. Is it conflict of interest when ICBC makes decision that is beneficial to them and force the other side to prove otherwise? If it were me, I don't have $3++k to give out. Especially if I were the victim, I would feel helpless, angry and depressed from the unjustice. What a cyclist can do in this case to help themselves? Or paying is the only choice? (My friend is also a driver having car insurance with ICBC, he believes ICBC would force him to pay in order to renew his insurance.)

That was my primary mission when I went to Rwanda to collect stories. I had to hear each and every one of them,‚Äù said Polish reporter Wojciech Tochman. ‚†Ä Lviv, October 5. Together with the publishing house Choven and the Ye Bookstore we organized a presentation of the Ukrainian edition of Wojciech Tochman‚Äôs book Today We‚Äôll Draw Death, translated by Andrii Bondar. The event was moderated by Olena Sheremet, who translates Polish literary reportage into Ukrainian. ‚†Ä Rwanda, April 6, 1994. In the post-colonial African country where two nations with a complicated history coexist ‚Äì the Tutsis and Hutus ‚Äì the head of state dies in an airplane crash. This marked the beginning of a genocide in which millions of people perished. Wojciech Tochman returned to this African country many times to understand how, after what happened there, people could live together. He spoke with survivors, perpetrators, and witnesses. ‚†Ä During the presentation, the author was asked why he thought the conflict had started. Here‚Äôs what Tochman replied, ‚ÄúCommunities are forged by relationships. When these relationships become unhealthy, they are often left untreated. People do not wish to kill one another. However, when, under the influence of certain circumstances, a person views others as terrifying or wrong entities, they become ready to annihilate.‚Äù ‚†Ä After the genocide and civil war in Rwanda, yesterday‚Äôs perpetrators and their victims live side by side and seek common ground. You can ride a bus or stand in line for groceries, and the person next to you may be a killer. Is forgiveness possible? ‚†Ä ‚ÄúForgiveness is the most complex of human arts. It is very private. And I believe that no survivor is obligated to forgive,‚Äù said Wojciech Tochman. ‚†Ä During the presentation, attendees had the opportunity to talk with the reporter, purchase books, and get autographs. Thanks to Iryna Sereda for the photos. If you didn‚Äôt manage to order the book, visit the Choven publishing house‚Äôs website üëâüèª choven.org/. ‚†Ä We are launching LMF Talks 2.0 with the backing of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).",,35,"{'like_count': 23, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 12261}",Lviv Media Forum,,2023-10-06 12:04:07,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/241134349_2052776048204534_5360433909278087483_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2nAZi5P4ewMAX95Ov-H&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBiZeIXQMQSqSji5vXOscHBsSu5qRyb7i19dX-wxhvNWQ&oe=655ABE79,https://www.facebook.com/100066521414129/posts/658869239673784,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/382980898_658868226340552_6428078416503510360_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=813123&_nc_ohc=9xF4hCp7MEQAX9ioFcW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCcRj13ezH6X-Fj7cifdkZI_SYtFdRvPmK08PQt6oC7XA&oe=65263E62

facebook,"Attention all quilt lovers! The Heritage Center is celebrating the late Nancy Roan (1932-2023) with an exhibit of her handmade quilts titled ""A Loving Tribute to a Quiltie Lady: The Quilts of Nancy Roan"" on view now until April 14 in the Putera Meeting Room on the first floor. Nancy made many quilts, including bed-sized quilts and wall hangings, over her many decades as a quilter‚Äîsome based on traditional designs while others were more contemporary and whimsical. Her quilts were definitely a product of her extraordinary creativity and sense of humor. Nancy worked hard to preserve Pennsylvania Dutch culture through recording the ‚Äúold ways‚Äù of cooking and quilting and as a stalwart member of the Goschenhoppen Historians. Join us for this delightful journey through Nancy‚Äôs quilting life!üëâPLEASE NOTE: the reception scheduled for the exhibit on Sunday, October 8 is postponed due to a scheduling conflict.

Joining the city as a brand new department director -- that's how important this job is -- I am proud to present: the former superintendent of Columbia Public Schools! Squee! ""Thank you, Madam Mayor. I couldn't be more thrilled. Columbia is such a wonderful town!"" I know you're all dying to know, what department will he direct? Utilities? No. Personnel? BORing. Nope. Police? Oh, hell no. Our new director will take charge of the most important city function of all: the newly-created Department of Niceness! He will review everyday activities, documenting their coefficient of nicety. Like: Was that City Council commenter NICE when she spoke against the huge electric rate hike we just passed? Was the police association NICE when it asked for ARPA money? And then got mad cuz no funds for them! Is it NICE for voters to challenge a Council member over a conflict of interest? And all these emails about robberies and shootings -- I mean, really people? -- are these emails NICE? I'm reading them now and -- well Director? What do you think? ""Oh, dear. Oh dear. So sad, all that meanness. Reminds me of -- school board meetings during Covid."" The Niceness Director will also be revising some of our city ordinances. Like changing ""must stop at Stop Sign"" to ""SHOULD stop at Stop Sign."" It's the new ""stoptional"" approach many cities are adopting to combat institutional oppression. Now onto your podcast plug! ""Thank you, Mayor. As everyone knows, I host the 'Imperfect Leader' podcast. Because all leaders ARE imperfect."" Hmm? What? I'm not imperfect. ""Of course you are."" I am NOT imperfect. ""Are too."" School superintendents might be imperfect. But Mayors, as I learned at Harvard, are certainly not. ""Are too!"" You wanna see imperfect? I'll show you imperfect! Just give me -- Hold it. What are you writing? What's that? ""A citation for superintendent shaming. Ordering you to appear before the new Columbia Commission on the Creation of Safe Spaces for Management. I'm the city staff liaison."" #FridayFunnies #columbiamo #cpsbest #como",,34,"{'like_count': 7, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 4693}",The Columbia Heart Beat,,2023-10-06 13:46:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352398955_915051582937664_7506382858866733610_n.jpg?stp=c10.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bgYXPv4UzS4AX_0heS_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAgq5IwcNdPbKTXm_LVYrBc44xddN5FIreCT0BJouKPCA&oe=6559EACF,https://www.facebook.com/100052147726821/posts/941118894303026,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385075129_941109580970624_7280398178659146915_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=UIN9A7svBmsAX9BpJWk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCg11xbOjmwK0E0TKZN41kJZguBRNx_VxRdsS_R6nMTGg&oe=654B8B1E

Prior to the Fort, there was a Fort from the War of 1812 in this land, post war, the barracks was used as a hospital.

The activity aims to educate the Tribal Leaders on the Basic Legal Processes in the mainstream and enhance their capability in Conflict Resolution. It also aims to harmonize the mainstream and customary processes in settling disputes between and among IPs. In the said activity, the participants were taught on how to document the proceedings in conflict resolution using customary laws as well as drafting of amicable settlement. The participants conveyed their heartfelt gratitude to the Ministry as they were able to learn a lot from the said activity and they had have been equipped with the necessary knowledge which they could be used in settling disputes effectively.",,33,"{'like_count': 15, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 10230}",Ministry of Indigenous Peoples' Affairs - BARMM,,2023-10-06 02:21:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/324921859_836914977383149_3353823496504486431_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=sgnDvumFaH0AX9Zlxzn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAr6KSn5VvRRyl-4_H1vrYgKDsxfU8BkT2HhSNqYfNZsw&oe=655AEBDA,https://www.facebook.com/100064559747201/posts/705684024926916,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386728953_705683298260322_7104183638486317470_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=hTzBeUThC8EAX_uRVK5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAksfg8v4RkfiDAPYchcdzGWsx2M19UTqr47z4Fr2mftg&oe=65255CCD
facebook,"Kalaban ng kapayapaan at kalaban ng bayan ang mga kritko ng confidential fund. Ito ang buwelta ni Vice President Sara Duterte sa kaniyang mga kritiko na bumabatikos sa confidential fund na kaniyang inihihirit sa Kongreso. Sa ika-122 anibersaryo ng Police Service sa Agusan Provincial Police Office (PPO) sa Camp Rafael Rodriguez, Butuan City, binigyang diin ni VP Sara na ang mga kritiko ng confidential fund ay maituturing na tutol sa kapayapaan at kaayusan. Dahil dito, sinabi ng pangalawang pangulo na ang mga ayaw sa kapayapaan at kaayusan ay malinaw na kumakalaban sa estado kaya‚Äôt dapat silang ituring na kalaban ng bayan. ‚ÄúMakinig kayo sa lahat ng sinasabi sa palibot ninyo at tandaan ninyo, kung sino man kumokontra sa confidential funds ay kumokontra sa kapayapaan.

üá≥üá±We hebben deze week zeer interessante gasten bij POLKA gehad! Bij ons nieuwe filiaal in Vrouwenbuurtlab kregen we bezoek van twee wijkagenten die in Laak werkzaam zijn. Dorota en Jeffrey vertelden ons wat hun werk inhoudt en met welke problemen en situaties ze benaderd kunnen worden. Het blijkt dat de rol van een wijkagent in Nederland heel anders is dan wat wij met deze functie in Polen associ√´ren! Hier kunnen ze bijvoorbeeld benaderd worden wanneer we een bemiddelaar nodig hebben in een conflict met een buurman of wanneer we ons hulpeloos voelen bij sommige opvoedingsproblemen met onze kinderen. 
Kortom, de wijkagent is er vooral om te helpen, niet alleen om toezicht te houden en aangeven wat wel en wat niet mag.

Er waren ook veel praktische vragen over het melden van overtredingen, overlast door buren of parkeren. Kortom: een zeer geslaagde bijeenkomst!,",,33,"{'like_count': 10, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 13751}",Polish Embassy in the Netherlands,,2023-10-06 09:09:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311516276_455512473345983_2678531039792965670_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nAu4WiUk2KMAX_MV4tf&_nc_oc=AQlissyWGM6BRbEm9XE7qNtjrs3OlmBZtmyNhXUPDPXY_83qGb1fEdaYAsXah2re6zE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA42KAJtDMxaQpHFYZJdrYNheETHLzCsk4XMRCWFQmcog&oe=6559F289,https://www.facebook.com/100066617018722/posts/670085941888634,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386747746_719554310217301_7802848558593155621_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=ytYA8Y9_X6gAX8MTTGM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDumrUToo1zQoJmwCiXIpGM7uwgApkb-2FH2-YAE70y2g&oe=65251BC1
facebook,"En conflict binnen of buiten onszelf een tijdje laten zijn in plaats van te proberen het snel op te lossen kan een uitdaging zijn. Als we echter de spanning tussen de twee tegengestelde krachten toe kunnen laten kan er een derde weg ontstaan die de twee kan verenigen en overstijgen. Jung geloofde dat deze transcendente kracht cruciaal is voor onze heelwording. De derde manier komt echter meestal als een verrassing omdat ze niet eerder onze verdediging kon binnendringen. Een overhaaste beweging om spanning los te laten kan wel de groei van het nog niet bekende derde alternatief in de weg staan. Maar als we lang genoeg de spanning kunnen laten rijpen in onze psychische baarmoeder, kunnen we letterlijk iets nieuws in onszelf baren. ¬© Marion Woodman Jungiaanse therapeute en auteur üß°",,33,"{'like_count': 15, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 24382}",HET LICHTPUNT,,2023-10-06 13:42:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/381070776_794244105964592_4535647568306966920_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4AmNLK6HIgMAX8NzTEP&_nc_oc=AQmSvqUzkAJi4G7jxdu5Mb0MvFTBqCWFaACWly0C3zlx7r4JClZI9N9q3qNNE5N_Kbs&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCwnzFndagj0Dw2moj-HF7soluhBA-0gwECdGkGn9du_Q&oe=655B88CB,https://www.facebook.com/100061370302103/posts/803164288405907,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386797209_803164171739252_187200009013787004_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=xKpy4tJHMxUAX9QZItf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCaw9SR6hJxCAoP5yiK5ZY8tNeefArD6tIGGnu9WbrNcw&oe=65253CFF

facebook,"""Parental alienation is a mental state in which a child‚Äîusually one whose parents are engaged in a high-conflict separation or divorce‚Äîallies strongly with 1 parent (the offending, but favored parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate reason.1 This condition occurs in the context of a maladaptive family dynamic involving at least 3 individuals: the alienating parent, who intentionally and purposefully manipulates the child to reject the other parent; the child, who experiences parental alienation; and the rejected, alienated parent. A variety of tactics and maneuvers are used by alienating parents to achieve their goal, ranging from bad-mouthing and disruption of visitation time to false allegations of abuse and criminal charges.""

facebook,"BATSWANA IMPLORED TO DISCUSS ON DRUG RELATED PROBLEMS The Drug Enforcement Agency Coordinator, Ms Pearl Ramokoka has implored on Batswana to discuss drug related issues openly. Ms Ramokoka made the appeal at the University of Botswana Counselling Day commemoration organized by the University‚Äôs Careers and Counselling Centre. The day which was themed ‚ÄúDrug-Free Life: A Journey of Millions‚Äô Support #Recovery is Possible was to sensitise the students on dangers of illicit drug use. In her keynote address, Ms Ramokoka raised concern that mental health is not a subject matter that is regularly discussed by the society. ‚ÄúMental health is not normally discussed amongst families, friends, church, at social events and communities in general. More often than not, if and when we discuss mental health, it is usually from a negative perspective, due to stigma that surrounds the subject matter.‚Äù Ms Ramokoka added that, ‚Äôwe take mental health as a self-care and private matter. As a result, opening up about our emotional state is not easy in our society as it is regarded as a weakness. That should not be the case. I am indeed happy that today we are celebrating mental health in a positive and relaxed environment‚Äô‚Äô. She urged Batswana to talk to their family members when they have drug problems and mental issues. ‚ÄúIf you are challenged by the drug related problems, please, seek counselling to get a professional help. As students do not to be ashamed or embarrassed to seek for help from professionals. It is a positive step that will get you out of this devilish situation.‚Äù According to Ms Ramokoka there is a need for mind-set change in the discussions that concern drug related issues. ‚Äò‚ÄôWe need to think differently, and we need to change how we have been doing things. Let us learn to discuss issues even when there are no problems so that we sustain good behaviour‚Äô‚Äô. Ms Ramokoka added that choosing to take drugs and alcohol is an unhealthy decision as drugs will only mask your problems and they will even create more problems to one‚Äôs life. She further highlighted that Drugs change the chemistry of the brain and the body to alter moods, emotions, and behaviors and perceptions, and impacting on how individuals relate with the world around them. ‚Äò‚ÄôDrugs can make you a person you are not, they affect your brain, respiratory, blood pressure, your heart and your health in general, they also affect your finances. Drugs also put you to be in conflict with the law as it is illegal to possess drugs. #ASecureNation #BWMindsetChange",,32,"{'like_count': 17, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 29041}","Ministry Of Defence and Security, Botswana",,2023-10-06 06:03:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271741474_230243639282230_6463544339279072754_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2zG3tvoUHM0AX-TuH6f&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC-s1CfVVW45HP9PO84Ko3uechU59tLOKWKfxvkLxtFfg&oe=655A59C0,https://www.facebook.com/100068897872737/posts/630044312635492,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387205976_630043529302237_1894067615169647885_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=49d041&_nc_ohc=m-ZII3bFm7gAX9lsnNl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDBIK4mosvqnHf3O_UjmyCwmj1ZKblqxePSQq6IFjZF2g&oe=6524EE7D

Inilantad ni Genelyn Dichoso, dating Secretary General ng Karapatan Quezon, ang mga estratehiya ng Karapatan Quezon kung paano ito gumawa ng mga propaganda para isalba ang kanilang mga kasamahan.  Ayon pa sa kanya, kung may nahuhuli naman na NPA, gagawa ang tagapagsalita ng Karapatan na sila ay mga organizers ng kababaihan, kabataan, at mga legal na organisasyon o kung ano man ang mga legal na gawain sa barangay. Palalabasin nila na ito ay legal. Si Genelyn ay mahigit 20 years ng naglingkod at ginamit ng CPP-NPA-NDF.
Tayo'y magkaisa upang mapigilan ang paglaganap ng mga mapanlinlang na propaganda at taktika ng mga teroristang grupo.

What we do in Metro-Laguna Baptist Church and what we herald is within the bounds of local church' independence. We don't claim superiority nor the basis of standard. We are still in the process of learning from others, big or small, known or unknown, from those who love and serve God. 
However, if I caused conflict to anyone as a result of what I've aired, it's not intentional, I express my sincere apology and entreat your kind understanding. TY very much.

Our first story begins 870 miles east of the Falklands, on the remote, mountainous, snow-covered British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands. Its ‚Äòcapital‚Äô is the smallest in the world ‚Äì the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) research station at King Edward Point, on the north-eastern coast of South Georgia, which has a permanent population of 22 scientists. In 1978, a contract was agreed between an Argentine business and Christian Salvesen, for the removal of an abandoned whaling station on the island at Grytviken, the burial place of polar explorers Sir Ernest Shackleton and Frank Wild. Two trips involving scrap merchants were made in the period December 1981 to March 1982 to assess the facilities there. However, little did the BAS realise that Argentine marines had infiltrated the working party, posing as scientists. On March 19, 1982 ‚Äì two weeks prior to the war proper ‚Äì the ‚Äòmetal workers‚Äô arrived at Leith Harbour without landing clearance and raised the Argentine flag. A formal protest was issued by the British embassy in Buenos Aires and within days two Argentine corvettes, ARA Drummond and ARA Granville, were deployed to reinforce their position. As a dependency of Falklands, BAS personnel contacted Governor Rex Hunt ‚Äì commander-in-chief and vice-admiral of the islands ‚Äì who dispatched the ice patrol vessel HMS Endurance with 22 Royal Marines. Back in Port Stanley, the famous Falklands War was about to kick off in farcical style. As it happened, a detachment of marine guards under Major Mike Norman had just relieved a similar group of soldiers from Naval Party 8901. Minus the men sent to South Georgia, this left a total of 57 Royal Marines, 25 Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF) volunteers, and 11 BAS hydrographers and sailors as the last line of defence against an impending Argentine attack. At 3.30pm, a Foreign Office telegram half-heartedly confirmed with Rex that ‚Äú‚Ä¶an Argentine task force could be assembling off Stanley at dawn tomorrow. You will wish to make your dispositions accordingly.‚Äù Even the local radio station was unsure of the news ‚Äì was this an April Fool‚Äôs joke? The official UK government line was to await a peaceful resolution at the UN. The governor‚Äôs thoughts, though, turned to defending the local population ‚Äì guided by the two majors at his disposal. Documents were shredded and burned, key installations were defended by the FIDF, and marines positioned themselves around Stanley. Rex Hunt, although advised to head for the hills to mount a guerrilla campaign, stood firm: Government House was to be their Alamo. The situation, to say the least, was pretty dire. Molotov cocktails and an array of small arms were brought to the Drill Hall and tactics were formed in the face of teenage volunteers, to prepare for the worst possible outcome. Argentine residents were rounded up and placed into custody at a local hotel. By 11pm, Operation Rosario ‚Äì to recapture the Malvinas ‚Äì was underway. Argentine special naval forces made an amphibious landing south of Stanley, followed by several other landings on nearby beaches. The airfield and the lighthouse were soon captured and, at 5.30am on April 2, the marines‚Äô base at Moody Barracks was destroyed by hand grenades; the invading force, grimly, thought the marines were fast asleep. Two lines of defence were formed at Government House and the Drill Hall. No Man‚Äôs Land comprised absurd obstacles like a tennis court, greenhouses and allotments. The Argentines successfully landed several armoured personnel carriers with heavy weaponry, headed in the direction of the governor ‚Äì one of which was put out of action by the marines. Within a short time, an aircraft carrier and a cruiser arrived off Camber Peninsula. Thought to be pinned down by 200 elite soldiers, the marines were, in fact, opposed by just 16 badly-equipped Argentine commandos with limited radio contact, huddled on a ridge above Government House. Adding to the theatrical nature of it all, at 7.30am, the local police chief had to intercept a Scottish exile, Henry Halliday, who was heading to work in the thick of the battle! Two hours later, faced with inevitable casualties, Governor Hunt agreed to a ceasefire. During the Battle of Government House, one Argentine commando was killed and six were wounded, versus no British casualties. A sweep of the islands was ordered but despite having superior numbers, some ham radio operators escaped the invaders‚Äô attention and relayed vital information back to the UK.

facebook,"Elder's Meditation of the Day - October 6
""Lots of people hardly ever feel real soil under their feet, see plants grow except in flower pots, or get far enough beyond the street light to catch the enchantment of a night sky studded with stars. When people live far from scenes of the Great Spirit's making, it's easy for them to forget His laws.""
-- Tatanga Mani (Walking Buffalo), STONEY
Nature is life's greatest teacher. The natural laws are hidden in nature. Hidden are solutions to everyday problems such as; conflict resolution, how to forgive, lessons about differences, how to manage organizations, how to think. Hidden are feelings. You can look at something and you will feel it. At night, have you ever looked at the sky when there are no clouds? As you look at all the stars, your heart will become very joyful. You will walk away feeling joyful and peaceful. We need to visit nature so we can see and feel these things.
My Creator, let me learn nature's lessons.

facebook,"My son scootered over this European Hornet on Wrotham Road yesterday, but still alive so I moved it to safety. It was HUGE!!! Much, much bigger than our average wasp üêù Here‚Äôs some info about them taken from a wildlife site for anyone interested. Nice to know that they‚Äôre docile and unaggressive! üíõ There's little doubt that the European hornet, Vespa crabro, is a rather fearsome looking insect. But this ferocious exterior betrays a species that is in fact rarely aggressive. Unlike their infamous relatives, hornets are unlikely to disrupt your picnic. Their sheer size - between 2-3 cm's for workers and males, 3-4 cm's for queens - and riotous buzz can however make them an intimidating proposition. They're our largest and most impressive eusocial wasp species, displaying the very highest level of organisation of animal sociality and frequently more than doubling the size of our more familiar common wasp, Vespular vulgaris. Both belong to the order Hymenoptera, comprising bees, wasps, ants and sawflies. Woods Mill currently resounds to the frantic commotion of hornets - particularly at night. This is where they differ from other members of the wasp family, Vespidae. Hornets are attracted to light. This behavioural trait can leave them viewed with no small amount of trepidation. On warm autumn evenings there's little doubt they'll pay a visit if their nest is placed in close proximity to a well-lit dwelling. Many a recent Woods Mill moth trap has been plagued by them. Hornets can of course potentially pack a punch. They harness a sting typical of their family group, though it's non-barbed and won't be pulled from the hornets body, unlike that of a honey bee. It's used predominantly in defence of the hive. The sting doesn't contain high levels of toxic species-specific compounds that tend to be wielded by invasive Asian hornets, and it's toxicity is on average lower than that of the honey bee, Apis mellifera. It is of course worth noting that stings can still trigger allergic reactions, and those susceptible to wasp venom will likely suffer the same from hornets. But the simple fact is that the European hornet is a docile creature, avoiding conflict and rarely displaying any form of aggression unless the nest is approached or the colony is threatened. It suffers from an undeserved reputation. The hornet queens are the sole colony survivors of a UK winter and they emerge as the weather finally starts to warm in early spring. They waste little time searching for a suitable location for their paper-pulp nest, mixing saliva with chewed plant fibres to create a hardy cement. Though the hornets display an avid attraction to light, the nest site will be quite the opposite, most likely built in a darkened tree hollow or sheltered cavity, usually two metres or so above the ground. Queens lay eggs into individual paper cells which then hatch as infertile workers. Whilst these tend the nest the queen settles into life as an egg-laying machine. The nest expands throughout the summer with new queens and males emerging in early autumn, keen to mate after a 'nuptial' flight. Life is short for the males who quickly die off, followed a short time later by the original queen and workers. The newly mated queens will then search for a hibernation site, never returning to the original nest.",,30,"{'like_count': 14, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 5716}",Meopham News & Views,,2023-10-06 16:49:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/400441481_6889484957772804_4294334951223517914_n.jpg?stp=c0.6.50.50a_cp1_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2fBV15HLG8cAX8QF59t&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAa_wvJ5v0WOVZotPPl92JAimZU_t5Fkl2L3763vSM85w&oe=655AF890,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1599844220313876/permalink/3277062889258659,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/383995787_10168778131695427_567092078538509145_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ZTK5ibZaxxEAX9KQ-7A&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDNnig5ea1v-SRvdH4l6HbhHYXbDEVplJ-NtUPLKHPQvQ&oe=653E293C

TEXT: PROVERBS 10: 1 - 17
TOPIC: THE CLUSTER OF WISDOM

PROVERBS 10: 1 - 17 NIV

1:The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.

2:Ill-gotten treasures have no lasting value, but righteousness delivers from death.

3:The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.

4:Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.

5:He who gathers crops in summer is a prudent son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son.

6:Blessings crown the head of the righteous, but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked.

7:The name of the righteous is used in blessings, but the name of the wicked will rot.

8:The wise in heart accept commands, but a chattering fool comes to ruin.

9:Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.

10:Whoever winks maliciously causes grief, and a chattering fool comes to ruin.

11:The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.

12:Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs.

13:Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense.

14:The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool invites ruin.

15:The wealth of the rich is their fortified city, but poverty is the ruin of the poor.

16:The wages of the righteous is life, but the earnings of the wicked are sin and death.

17:Whoever heeds discipline shows the way to life, but whoever ignores correction leads others astray.

THE CLUSTER OF WISDOM

Today's text gives us an idea about how to deal with wealth and poverty and points out that wealth acquired by unrighteous means has no value but wealth gotten through righteous means is far more valuable. 

The wisdom here is that diligence under God's guidance is the secret of acquiring wealth but a lazy person is a disgrace and is heading towards poverty (vs.4-5). 

In fact, verses 15-17 confirm that riches fortify the city for the righteous but verses 6 and 7 show that the wise man shows the contrast between the life of a righteous person and the wicked. 

While blessings will be the portion of the righteous, violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked and even their names will rot (vs.7). 

Verses 8 and 9 show that the wise accepts and is obedient to instruction whereas the fool pays no attention to instruction and that one can walk with his or her head high if such a person is known for integrity but he who takes the crooked path will be exposed.

QUESTION: Are you on the path of folly or pursuing righteousness and hard work?

PRAYER: Lord God, help me to always tread the path of wisdom by pursuing righteousness in order to attract Your blessings, in Jesus name. Amen.

I experience peace in my inner world. There is no restlessness or rush to do things as it used to happen in the past. Inner dialogue has considerably reduced.

Thoughts used to trouble me, now I can easily see them come and go. Earlier I used to struggle with my thoughts. I can now be observant of my suffering or conflict and dissolve them with my awareness and prayer. There is no disturbance within.

Earlier when a troublesome event happened, I used to feel a lot of stress and tension. Body used to go into struggle mode. Now it feels light and I am able to quickly bring my inner turmoil into calmness.

If some hurts me now, I can see the hurt within me and in 10 minutes it is gone. If something major happens, I could dissolve it in an hour. 

I can easily go about my everyday work without conflict. 
I used to eat mechanically, now I eat with total awareness. Concentration has increased. 

I know my journey of Enlightenment has just begun and there is a lot Sri Amma Bhagavan has to offer me in the path ahead. So grateful for all Your timeless blessings.

facebook,"Elder‚Äôs Meditation of the Day ~ October 6

‚ÄúLots of people hardly ever feel real soil under their feet, see plants grow except in flower pots, or get far enough beyond the street light to catch the enchantment of a night sky studded with stars. When people live far from scenes of the Great Spirit‚Äôs making, it‚Äôs easy for them to forget His laws.‚Äù 
‚ÄìTatanga Mani (Walking Buffalo), STONEY

Nature is life‚Äôs greatest teacher. The natural laws are hidden in nature. Hidden are solutions to everyday problems such as; conflict resolution, how to forgive, lessons about differences, how to manage organizations, how to think. Hidden are feelings. You can look at something and you will feel it. At night, have you ever looked at the sky when there are no clouds? As you look at all the stars, your heart will become very joyful. You will walk away feeling joyful and peaceful. We need to visit nature so we can see and feel these things.

facebook,"Callie Eh, Malaysian / Swiss Photographer, born 1972 Colour of Life, (Morocco), 2021 Fine Art Photography Born and raised in Malaysia, currently based in Switzerland. Her travels have inspired her to capture life with photography. What started off as a hobby, capturing special moments of her time around new cities and environments eventually evolved into a career she never foresaw coming. This very passion drove her to use the camera to express and deliver narratives previously unseen and untold. For her, photography became more than a way of creating memories. ‚ÄãPhotography has been a tremendous support for Callie and It has been a refuge for Callie during difficult times and a safe space to explore a multitude of emotions concerning love, conflict, and hope. Callie‚Äôs works mostly refer to life ‚ÄúIn the moment‚Äù. She captures people to reveal honesty and express the authenticity of their individuality, heritage, and life. The raw power of her images makes us want to know more about the subjects, their life, and their personal stories. ‚ÄãARTIST STATEMENT For me photography was a life-saver. It picked me up at a difficult time in my life and I have not let it go ever since. Originally from Malaysia, I have lived in various countries and I am now based in Switzerland. Photography has changed my view of the world and has made me see things differently. I like to mix genres but my greatest photographic passion right now is documentary photography, inspired by my travels, the people I meet, the different cultures and the different ways of life.",,28,"{'like_count': 17, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 136352}",A CELEBRATION OF FEMALE ARTISTS,,2023-10-06 15:03:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/396963602_3699287400300326_7035825126309722014_n.jpg?stp=c0.9.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=J5q2vca4KYwAX_zIcYL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfATogUDIGqS7uG04ZSjVo4_5em9qdEKVBm2445ydxM_VQ&oe=655A8111,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1080475609511196/permalink/1348408679384553,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386601550_6148484081918418_4691662167626065626_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=4c1e7d&_nc_ohc=cJJHNBAQ0akAX_1SVUT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDN_EHi3X8uaxrVs2ck3GhHVgeN6PCtfdBh_8tOw89nRw&oe=65242BD5

facebook,"""In 2019, a poll found seven out of ten Iraqis wanting Americans to withdraw from the country, with VOA News reporting 78 percent of Iraqis feeling the US military presence in their country ‚Äúis provoking more conflict‚Äù than it is preventing. The following year, Iraq‚Äôs parliament passed a resolution calling for the US to withdraw, prompting war-hungry American news networks such as CNN to condescendingly cover the move with headlines such as, ‚ÄúIraq has voted to expel US troops. Whether they‚Äôll actually be kicked out is far from clear‚Äù.

facebook,"Pack Fact Friday History time! The African wild dog was first scientifically described back in 1820 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck, a Dutch aristocrat, zoologist and museum director. They were discovered and described after Coenraad saw the dogs off the coast of Mozambique. Since then, the dogs have been studied, analyzed, hypothesized and reviewed. We have gained insight on their social structure, habitat, range, vocalization and so much more! Though we have come a LONG way since 1820 and gathered invaluable data, the one thing we can we are absolutely certain on is that there is still so much to learn. As a species that is known for their complex and tight social structure, unique vocalizations, and impressive hunting skills, every piece of gathered data serves to continue to build the foundation of what we know about the dogs. We at KAWDCP are excited and honored to contribute to that data base through our field studies. One of the hypothesis regarding the persecuted free-roaming African wild dogs we are studying is the potential adaptation of vocalizations. Due to the conflict and human presence, have these packs decreased or even ceased the use of their vocilziations in order to remain undetected? By supporting the organization, you're furthering research and what we know about this illusive species.

Philippine National Police Chief, Police General Benjamin C. Acorda Jr., led the send-off ceremony for 25 police officers who are set to be deployed to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). The event, which took place on October 2, 2023, was attended by dignitaries and officials, including Secretary Antonio Ernesto F. Lagdameo Jr., the Special Assistant to the President.

In his send-off message to the PNP contingent, PGen. Acorda emphasized the significance of the Philippines‚Äô unwavering commitment to international peacekeeping efforts. He stated, ‚ÄúIn line with our noble peacekeeping missions aimed at promoting global peace and security, we gather here today to bid farewell to 25 courageous officers who will be deployed to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).‚Äù

The Philippines has a long-standing tradition of contributing to UN peacekeeping missions. Over the years, Filipino police officers have consistently served with honor and distinction in various UN operations worldwide, often in challenging conflict zones, where they risk their lives to protect vulnerable communities and uphold the principles of the United Nations.

‚ÄúTo the 25 members of the PNP contingent who are embarking on this mission, you are about to represent the PNP, our nation, and our people on an international stage,‚Äù PGen. Acorda emphasized. ‚ÄúYour journey will be arduous, filled with both triumphs and trials, but I have absolute confidence that you will carry our flag with unwavering pride and unwavering integrity.‚Äù

As these officers prepare to venture forth to South Sudan, the PNP Chief encouraged them to serve with honor, courage, and unwavering dedication. He urged them to return home safely, knowing that their country is immensely proud of their service.

During the ceremony, Secretary Antonio Ernesto F. Lagdameo Jr., the Special Assistant to the President, also addressed the contingent, emphasizing the significance of their mission and the trust that the nation places in their hands. His heartfelt insights and words of encouragement were a profound source of inspiration for the officers as they prepared to face the challenges ahead.

In conclusion, PGen. Acorda extended his heartfelt best wishes to the 25 PNP contingent members, acknowledging the sacrifices they are making by leaving behind the comforts of home, the warmth of their families, and the familiar streets of their nation. He praised their willingness to venture into an environment fraught with uncertainty and danger, commending them for their selflessness and profound sense of duty to uphold the ideals of the United Nations.

‚ÄúMabuhay kayong lahat! May your journey be safe, your mission successful, and your hearts filled with the pride of serving humanity,‚Äù he concluded.

As these dedicated officers embark on their mission in South Sudan, the Philippines stands united in wholeheartedly supporting their noble efforts to promote peace and security on the global stage.

facebook,"Today's Sandhyavela Message!   Prioritize your inner wellness and cultivate a mindset of peace by consciously deciding to rise above any situation that triggers inner conflict. Remember in order to create inner tranquility you have to be willing to lose your connections with the people, places, and the things that create the noise.

instagram,"Fifty years ago today, a war erupted in the Middle East that changed not just the region, but the world. It‚Äôs a war of many names, depending on who you ask: the October War, the Yom Kippur War, the Ramadan War, or the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The war‚Äôs victor is just as disputed. It began with a two-pronged attack against Israel by Egypt and Syria.‚Å†
Egypt attacked from the south, to take back the Sinai Peninsula, and Syria from the north, to take back the Golan Heights.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Israel had captured both six years prior in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, alongside occupying what remained of historic Palestine.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The recently formed state was riding high on that victory: it never anticipated an attack like this, especially not during Yom Kippur, an auspicious day for Jews. Meanwhile, the politics of the Cold War played in the background.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The Soviets supplied the Arab countries with weapons and the United States backed Israel. The two sides were on the brink of military conflict for the first time since the so-called Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.‚Å†

instagram,"If you want a fake relationship, avoid conflict.

If you want a real relationship, learn to fight wise.

By which I just mean learn how to honor BOTH your own experience AND your partner‚Äôs ... at the same time.

Learn to fully feel what you are feeling while simultaneously holding space for your beloved other to fully feel what they are feeling, too.

Make space for how they are seeing/describing things even as you continue to hold space for your own ‚Äúversion of truth.‚Äù

I know that ain‚Äôt easy ... which is why we run from conflict (even when we stay and fight).

We far too often expect to be seen and heard before we are willing to see and hear.

Yet we cannot receive a love we are not willing to offer.

The partner you‚Äôre looking for is not the one you‚Äôll never fight with.

It‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs willing to stay in the fire with you when things suddenly turn shitty, who‚Äôs willing to take radical ownership of their part in starting that shit-fire, and who can (at least before long) say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for my part in this. I love you. Let‚Äôs figure this out together.‚Äù

Wouldn‚Äôt just that much be amazing?

instagram,"Former Indian cricket team captain Mohammad Azharuddin has been disqualified from contesting the Hyderabad Cricket Academy (HCA) elections on grounds of violation of terms.

Azharuddin‚Äôs disqualification was based on the decision made by a committee constituted by the Supreme Court, and headed by Justice Lau Nageshwar Rao, for handling HCA‚Äôs affairs. The committee was formed after reports of brewing differences surfaced between the Azharuddin, who was the president of HCA, and its working members.

Azharuddin was elected president of the association in the last election held in September 2019. His tenure ended a year later. However, he continued to hold the position until Supreme Court appointed a single-member panel to look into the issue.

Former Supreme Court judge Justice L Nageswara Rao removed the former cricketer from the list of voters for HCA polls scheduled this month on the grounds of conflict of interest as he was president of the Deccan Blues Cricket Club while serving as the president of HCA till early this year.

Nageswara Rao wrote to Azharuddin that he was removed from the voter list on the basis of the order passed by him on July 31, 2023.

‚ÄúAccording to the order dated 31-07-2023, all the executive committee members of clubs in which a person/his family members are involved in the management of multiple clubs have been disqualified to either vote/contest in the ensuing elections to the HCA for one term or a period of three years, whichever is greater.

In the past quarter, our dedicated team:
üå≥ Spent a total of 18 days monitoring isolated orangutans in the Batang Toru Ecosystem
üìû Received and responded to 3 conflict reports from concerned communities
üôè Successfully rescued and relocated three orangutans, offering them a second chance at life in the wild.
ü¶ß Safely confiscated an orangutan from danger, ensuring their safety and well-being.

instagram,"We‚Äòre celebrating National Badger Day with this beautiful photograph taken by @rachelbigsby in ancient woodland. ü¶°üì∏

Rachel recounts: ‚ÄúOver the countless hours that I‚Äôve loved, learnt from, observed and photographed European badgers, I've witnessed the astonishing eco-system engineering they do to support the health of our forests. Whether that‚Äôs seed dispersal or creation of habitats for our precious pollinators. üêù

As a photographer, I owe immense gratitude to our forests for providing me with a creative and calming space to work in. However, it‚Äôs worrying to imagine what would happen to badgers without access to forests, as they could easily become like the brown bears and wolves that they once roamed the land with. Without forests, badgers will be more forced into urban areas where they face an increased risk of persecution and human-wildlife conflict ‚Äì putting an already struggling species under significant risk of extinction.""

We must protect our fantastic forests. üíú

Here's an affirmation you can use to protect yourself from the evil eye:

""I am surrounded by a shield of positivity and light. My aura radiates strength and resilience, deflecting any harm. I am protected, I am empowered, and I am filled with boundless positivity. So it is, and so it shall be.""

Repeat this affirmation regularly, especially in moments when you feel the need for extra protection. It's important to say it with intention and belief in its power.

I'll be sharing some powerful techniques on cleansing and protecting your energy in my upcoming posts. Stay tuned for some practical tips and rituals to keep your positivity shining bright!

instagram,"The world is desperately short on teachers, with 44 million more teachers needed to cover every child by 2030, says a new UNESCO report. Parts of Africa account for one-third of the shortfall. Teachers are leaving the profession twice as often as they were in 2015. ‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Across parts of Africa, over 13,000 schools closed over the last four years because of conflict and insecurity, say NGOs ‚Äì including countries like Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Niger ‚Äì affecting over 2.5 million children. ‚Å£
‚Å£
One in five children in southern, western and eastern Africa are not in school. The countries with the highest rates of uneducated children also tend to have the highest levels of poverty. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Worldwide, COVID has also intensified gendered violence and economic disparities between men and women. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Lack of school access was a problem before the pandemic, with up to 60 million children out of school. Barriers to education, including pandemic closures, unaffordability and gender discrimination, were linked to higher risk of child labor and child marriage. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Over half of girls who dropped out of school during the pandemic in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania reported pregnancies, according to UN Women. ‚Å£
‚Å£
In Africa, most teaching vacancies are for entirely new positions, says UNESCO. But as demand for schooling grows, the availability of places to receive training as a teacher hasn‚Äôt, making positions hard to fill. And once on the job, teaching resources ‚Äî like textbooks, curricula reform and poor equipment ‚Äî also play a large factor in retention. ‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Women are much more likely to stay in the field, as jobs with higher pay and social mobility are more available to men. ‚Å£

instagram,"Over the past year or so, I‚Äôve become reacquainted with myself in a way that feels quietly liberating. 

I think I‚Äôve hoped to be different. Not in particularly drastic ways, and neither in ways that differ from everybody else - we all entertain at least a little bit of conflict with who we truly are - but the hope has been there, tucked just beyond the reach of what I was willing to address. It felt like a general, ongoing discomfort with what I wanted, the lingering suspicion that what I felt naturally drawn towards was not what was best for me.

And sometimes that suspicion has been correct. If offered the choice: stay in or go out? I would/will always prefer to stay in. It‚Äôs easier. It‚Äôs comfortable. But challenging myself to be more open and social has been so nourishing for me. Spending time with people makes me feel good, sometimes - often - better than hunkering down at home alone.

In other ways, though, I‚Äôve come to accept that there are certain parts of myself that just *are*. Having an annoyingly loud laugh, for example, or always leaving parties early so I can have two hours to decompress before I go to sleep. Small talk is fine but let‚Äôs also discuss dying. I can‚Äôt speak slower and yes, I should stop interrupting people, but I have something to say and I‚Äôll burst if I don‚Äôt say it right now. I‚Äôm catastrophically bad at communicating and I‚Äôve tried to be better but I just can‚Äôt and criticising myself has never done anything. I can love high-brow literature but also salivate over tawdry gossip. Two things can co-exist! Wanting something that is sometimes good for me and sometimes not. Feeling that I should improve but accepting that I‚Äôm a person, not a trajectory.

Perhaps it‚Äôs more accurate to say that I‚Äôm becoming less stressed about not understanding myself, and less critical of the parts I think I should change. I‚Äôm also understanding that none of my friends have ever cared about this shit, and have long seen the heart of me that I still struggle to glimpse.",,1845,"{'like_count': 1824, 'comment_count': 21, 'num_users': 93028}",Chloe Plumstead,,2023-10-06 11:03:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/370954128_1945867789145111_5716645580876207364_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Mdf0sFa0DT0AX8R4XBn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCFud-k-74Mc5ErAtKmeWUXVvKT110cuIxmzfJhxvebfQ&oe=655B6544,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyDhQzhMwvO/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/385633450_734551535115071_4315897882291997931_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=oLVtGPG2NLIAX-H3gN8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA_UJ3LIxz78phJgRszjjegsuHYIw4sxvAQNSxRP47dKg&oe=655A74D4

Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman

qotd: If you could only eat one thing for the rest of your life what would it be? 

üí≠:
Medieval horror? Sign me up please! I was recommended this book by an employee at my favourite bookstore in Toronto @littleghostsbooks . It is spoopy (spooky) season but I read horror year round, so please drop any recommendations below ‚¨áÔ∏è in the comments. I admit, I haven‚Äôt felt this excited about a book in months, so I can‚Äôt wait to start this one! But first..I have to tackle a few arcs that are coming due, a bookclub read, as well as a buddy read first ü´¢ (bookstagrammer things). I know most of you can relate to this, is there a book you‚Äôre excited to start soon? 

GR Description:

The year is 1348. Thomas, a disgraced knight, has found a young girl alone in a dead Norman village. An orphan of the Black Death, and an almost unnerving picture of innocence, she tells Thomas that plague is only part of a larger cataclysm‚Äîthat the fallen angels under Lucifer are rising in a second war on heaven, and that the world of men has fallen behind the lines of conflict.

Is it delirium or is it faith? She believes she has seen the angels of God. She believes the righteous dead speak to her in dreams. And now she has convinced the faithless Thomas to shepherd her across a depraved landscape to Avignon. There, she tells Thomas, she will fulfill her to confront the evil that has devastated the earth, and to restore to this betrayed, murderous knight the nobility and hope of salvation he long abandoned.

As hell unleashes its wrath, and as the true nature of the girl is revealed, Thomas will find himself on a macabre battleground of angels and demons, saints, and the risen dead, and in the midst of a desperate struggle for nothing less than the soul of man.

instagram,"A conflict is not a red flag! üö©

You might be thinking, ""Duh, obviously.""

üòüBut if you're anything like me, my nervous system was so used to toxicity, that any hint of a disagreement sent me spiraling into doubts about my relationship. 

I was freaking out!

‚û°Ô∏è Until I let go of the fantasy that healthy relationships mean never having hurt feelings or conflict. 

*This doesn't mean tolerating abuse or mistreatment.*

üíô It means when you have real love, there will be happiness, affection, and closeness.

And it will also mean conflicts, uncomfortable emotions, and working through issues that come up. 

Which I realized is GREAT NEWS! üòÄ

üåøIt means we don't have to be perfect to find real love.

You can be loved just as you are-

üîπOn your bad days

üîπWhen you're emotional

üîπAnd when you disagree with your partner

Healthy love isn't perfect...

üåà But it's even better than that. 

It's REAL.

Physically, mentally, and emotionally. Growing up, I have always felt the need to keep my head up high, to support the people and animals around me. I don‚Äôt like to express my emotions when I am feeling weak, and it‚Äôs not easy for me to ask for help. So this is new to me to express very publicly with you all, that I am drained.

Every single day I work my butt off providing the best possible care we can for our animals, and creating the best most positive and welcoming environment for our people. I want everyone to feel like our farm is a safe space & healing sanctuary for those who need it most no matter age, gender, race, background, etc. 
I am an extreme empath, whether it‚Äôs with horses or people. I always want to be the strong one in time of uncertainty, and be there for those who needed someone. I struggled with conflict & didn‚Äôt like when someone was upset or angry. I still don‚Äôt, but in a professional business and adult world there‚Äôs a fine balance which I am learning more about every day. Being an empath I feel the emotions of everything, whether it‚Äôs said in words by people, or felt by energy in animals. We care for 30+ horses every single day, not just ‚Äúregular horses‚Äù but special needs horses who all have their own traumas & emotions to work through. I‚Äôve experienced a numerous amount of trauma in my life that I don‚Äôt normally share with people and I feel like that is why I can relate so well to these horses who have been through something similar. So it hurts me when they are hurting.

instagram,"Sometimes, we know we‚Äôre growing: we practice a new skill, try a new approach, or respond in a different way. We may choose to change parts of our lives, like switching careers or trying to cook healthier meals. This type of growth often happens when we feel we have the capacity to expand, but we can often grow during periods of challenge, too.

A difficult boss requires you to manage up, a conflict with a family member causes you to revisit an old, painful narrative, a health crisis throws your whole worldview off-kilter: hard, uncomfortable situations can prompt our growth in a myriad of ways.

instagram,"Most people for almost two hundred years believe that the only aspect that matters in every activity we undertake is its quality and the effect it will bring, because only the benefits it carries to us are essential for our further existence. As a matter of fact, even the greatest intentions make no sense if they fail to produce tangible results that reflect our potential success. Therefore, each person should evaluate all activities in terms of victory or gloomy defeat, because only they count at the end of our life. Nonetheless, some eminent sages believe that usually the most vital thing that counts in the whole world is the value of the energy and time we have devoted to getting a given phenomenon, because life often does not give us what we want, despite our greatest effort and enormous amount of commitment. Actually, there are many individuals determined to achieve the same goals as a given person, so the whole view of getting a given activity changes dramatically as a result of the clash of several equivalent forces. Hence, we should give our whole heart to each activity and accept the final score as it will be. So does it all depend on the end outcome? Or maybe the contribution counts before the result?
_
As a matter of fact, it is unimaginably difficult to resolve this conflict considering that absolutely no one knows whether our life brings a further effect in the form of nothingness or some further existence. Actually, both the result of our activities and the contribution we make to them are extremely essential to our development and the importance of our entire life. Therefore, we should take into account the scale of enthusiasm and strength we are presenting, but not forgetting that the final effect is also often equally vital, seeing that we must combine both dedication and tangible benefits during our road to happiness.

Well Rilfriends, bagaimanapun juga silent treatment sebaiknya dihindari yah. Meskipun kamu lagi marah banget sama seseorang dan kamu butuh waktu sendiri, sebaiknya tetap ijin dan bilang baik-baik. Daripada berujung pada salah paham dan kerenggangan hubungan. Karena kunci hubungan apapun kan komunikasi üí¨

Bila masih sulit untukmu untuk memulai komunikasi ketika lagi cekcok, yuk konseling di Rilismi. Konselor kami akan mendengarkan masalahmu dan membantu memberikan saran untukmu. Baca juga yah artikel terkait agar kamu lebih memahami silent treatment itu sendiri. Semangat ya Rilfriends!¬†üíñü•∞

I once read in a review that you can only read one Kristen Hannah book every so often in order to give yourself the time needed to emotionally recover from the absolute devastation her books bring. Truer words have never been spoken üòÇ

With her new upcoming novel publishing in a few months, I decided to tackle one of her backlist books, and whew, this one left me in shambles‚Ä¶again.

There‚Äôs just something about how she writes her characters with such depth that you feel like you‚Äôre right there with them each day, experiencing their heartbreak. That, coupled with her ability to bring attention and awareness to historical events or time periods that are not often written about in historical fiction, fully immerses the reader in such an in depth, highly emotional, reading experience.

This book which explores childhood trauma, generational trauma, and both the effects and experiences of civilians in conflict, specifically the siege of Leningrad during WWII is no different.

This sweeping novel about love, war, and unimaginable loss is sure to move. And more than likely have you breaking out the Kleenex üò≠

instagram,"The Balkan Wars began primarily due to a combination of long-standing ethnic and territorial disputes in the Balkan Peninsula and the desire of Balkan states to weaken and dislodge the Ottoman Empire's presence in the region. Here's a brief overview of how they started:
The Balkan Peninsula was home to various ethnic groups, including Serbs, Bulgarians, Greeks, Albanians, and others, who had long-standing grievances and aspirations for self-determination. Nationalist and ethnic tensions had simmered for decades.
 The Ottoman Empire, which had controlled much of the Balkans for centuries, was in a state of decline by the early 20th century. This decline created a power vacuum and an opportunity for Balkan states to assert their independence.
 In 1912, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Montenegro formed the Balkan League, a military alliance, with the common goal of driving the Ottoman Empire out of the Balkans and expanding their own territories. The Balkan League launched an offensive against the Ottoman Empire in October 1912. They achieved significant success, capturing most of the Ottoman-held Balkan territories. However, as they began to discuss the division of these newly acquired territories, disputes arose, leading to the outbreak of the Second Balkan War.
The Second Balkan War began in June 1913 when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its share of the spoils from the First Balkan War, attacked its former allies, Serbia and Greece. Romania and the Ottoman Empire also joined the conflict. The war ended with the Treaty of Bucharest in August 1913, which redrew the borders and further reshaped the Balkans.
These wars were driven by a complex mix of factors, including nationalism, territorial ambitions, and the decline of the Ottoman Empire. They significantly altered the map of the Balkans but also left lasting ethnic and political tensions in the region, contributing to future conflicts. #Serbs #bulgarians #greeks #albanians #montenegro #ottomanempire #firstbalkanwar #secondbalkanwar #nationalist #territorialambitions #balkans #nationalism #treatyofbucharest1913 #talkdiplomacy #upsc #css #upscmotivation #csstricks #upscaspirants #warandpeace #geopolitics #ir #borders",,701,"{'like_count': 696, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 91579}",TalkDiplomacy IR,,2023-10-06 16:55:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/328799506_219447953811073_3104956161528819700_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pw2J3khjfvsAX8PWC77&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDB5PH0Ztb9ehsOpSDE9OQh8wdqO0qrpdwjjvpSRE76eQ&oe=655AEA98,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyEJkf7rF2A/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386295057_696585125320108_2924899037899860563_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=yokgxDgEwUMAX9-sYQ6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAAnbMb0hicz4ssWGhc3jQ-iZXws-OJdGffJxNrnkryJA&oe=653092AE
instagram,"‚ÄúAll I heard were the sounds of an explosion, followed by the cries of my granddaughter, 'Grandpa, my leg.‚Äô‚Äù 

Over a decade of war in Syria has left behind a lethal legacy of mines and explosives. Among one of the most severely affected areas is Ariha, located in the Idleb governorate in northwest Syria. 

The conflict forced many local families to flee. When they finally returned home, they were faced with a new danger‚Äîthe mines and explosives that now contaminated their land. 

Abu Zeyad was on his farmland with his young granddaughter when, unaware of the danger, they crossed into a minefield. There was a catastrophic explosion, seriously injuring the little girl. 

In August 2022, HALO Syria identified large amounts of explosives, as well as two  minefields and began work to make the community safe. Our explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams have since safely destroyed 133 hazardous items and earlier this year, our first-ever Mechanical Clearance Team in the region began work.

instagram,"The First Punic War, which took place from 264 BC to 241 BC, was a crucial moment in Roman history as it marked their first major military campaign beyond Italy. This war primarily revolved around naval conflicts against Carthage, a formidable maritime power, and had significant consequences for both Rome and Carthage.

What made the First Punic War distinctive was its focus on naval warfare. Although Rome was known for its legions and land-based military prowess, it lacked a substantial naval force. To challenge Carthage's dominance at sea, Rome quickly built a formidable fleet. A pivotal invention during this conflict was the ""corvus,"" a boarding device that allowed Roman soldiers to engage in close combat on enemy ships. 

In 260 BC, the Battle of Mylae marked a historic moment for the Roman Republic as it achieved its first significant naval victory against the mighty Carthaginian Empire. The key to Rome's success at Mylae was the ingenious corvus. This boarding bridge, equipped with a large spike at its end, allowed Roman soldiers to securely attach to enemy ships and engage in hand-to-hand combat. This essentially transformed a naval battle into a land battle, where Rome's well-trained infantry had the upper hand. The Carthaginians were caught off guard, and the Romans succeeded in boarding and capturing a significant number of Carthaginian vessels, resulting in a decisive victory.

The success at Mylae had a profound impact on the course of the First Punic War. It encouraged Rome to invest more in its navy, leading to the construction of additional ships and the training of more sailors. The corvus became a symbol of Roman naval innovation and played a significant role in subsequent naval engagements.

instagram,"MY ROOMMATE IS A VAMPIRE
By Jenna Levine
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Thank you to @prhaudio for the free audiobook.

I‚Äôm jumping in on  @lindsey.the.librarian Spooky Bingo. Here‚Äôs my first square: ‚ÄúA book on my fall TBR.‚Äù

üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Q: What‚Äôs your preferred type of vampire (sweet, terrifying, sparkly)?

A: I‚Äôm in love with Matthew Claremont from A Discovery of Witches. Brilliant, scary, broken, handsome.

üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What‚Äôs it about?
Cassie is in desperate need of a place to live. She‚Äôs an artist who works at the library and can barely make rent. So when she sees an ad for a roommate for only $200 a month, her interest lights up‚Äîbut so does her skepticism. No way a normal person would rent for that low amount of money, right?

When she goes to meet her would-be roommate she notices some things: 1. He‚Äôs gorgeous. 2. He‚Äôs very odd‚Äìhe dresses and speaks like he‚Äôs not from this century. 3. He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand basic things like the internet.

As the title implies, this is because Frederick is an adorable, clueless vampire who fell into a coma for 100 years and is desperate to have a roommate who can help him understand the modern world. Too bad his traditional mother is set on roping him into an arranged marriage while he and Cassie discover their mutual attraction.

üíóMy thoughts:
This book is just plain sweet. It‚Äôs low angst, cute misunderstandings, a cinnamon roll vampire and no third act breakup. This is a feel-good book.

Cassie is a fun FMC, and one I think most people can connect with. She‚Äôs struggling, but kind. Has major imposter syndrome, but works hard. And she has a thing for a hot guy who dresses like Mr. Darcy.

Frederick is so clueless. I did think it odd that he came off as old school chivalrous and a bit naive in romance, then later admitted a long string of sexual flings for part of his life.

The conflict with Frederick‚Äôs mother was too easily (and kind of cheesily) resolved. But this book is intentionally low angst, so it works.

I recommend this if you need a sweet, fun, happy read this spooky season!

üéß Gilli Messer is a great audiobook narrator. I wish there would have been a male voice for Frederick‚Äôs thoughts and letters, but she pitches her voice well!",,630,"{'like_count': 556, 'comment_count': 74, 'num_users': 9789}",Jessica Booth,,2023-10-06 12:03:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/402798373_1322368835306592_6934193564862746643_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=7vsNIbddvBEAX-AlV7Y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDSlw2gXMwQfQgy0Liu5x496tXVhkompPO-utHQsXCTWQ&oe=655A199A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyDoGWxr9pl/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/387005712_18103067485343838_572384708903096607_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=MkwIpgzB8-YAX95hn8j&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB70deCGd40sLvn6j89qVhQezJfLPuGDcgaDiLLwrHjmw&oe=6548C3CB

instagram,"Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @the.holistic.psychologist I see so many people arguing when people become adults. 25 was the standard. Now people are saying it‚Äôs actually 30. All of this is based on brain development.

The truth is many adults are children in adult bodies. 

It‚Äôs an epidemic in our culture. We don‚Äôt fully go through developmental phases. We don‚Äôt get healthy modeling. We don‚Äôt learn what it is to be an adult, emotionally.

In my 30‚Äôs I sat on my couch and realized: I‚Äôm a 10 year old emotionally. I can‚Äôt directly solve (or even address) conflict. I can‚Äôt speak honestly about what I feel. I don‚Äôt even know what my needs are.

Im still developing that maturity.

Being an adult is really a process. It takes intentional work. It takes being uncomfortable. And of course humility to say: I need to grow here.

They walked with silent majesty, like veterans of a forgotten war, carrying the weight of distant worlds on their shoulders.
A masked man, his face concealed by a dark helmet, walked with a melancholic dignity. He recalled soldiers from a faded photo from a past conflict, their tired looks and scars hidden beneath their helmets. But his armour shone with light, as if he carried with him a hope that survives even in the darkest times - Generated with MidJourney v5. #designmidjourney #design #architect #architecturaldesign #archilovers #architecture #midjourney #midjourneyart #ai #digitalart #artgallery #photography #interiordesign #artistsoninstagram #love #starwars #photooftheday #art #city #mood #film #inspiration #fashion #milano #venice #life #gaming #impression_shots #yoda #black",,522,"{'like_count': 517, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 9195}",Alessandro Peritore,,2023-10-06 16:39:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/349218004_594664442636097_8800667737108559253_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=_gbqtPrh0SYAX-6TeOi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBRYCLeh1HnSxoSbM_Y1r4YJurcgZPYYb3rE0w8-IbdbA&oe=655A9D65,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyEHr0ro-SO/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386337570_1423129534907276_6442491507016740434_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=czlJHMHCbycAX9rnrv-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA0hMUqCTyQ3qG8m2Cn2aVGwPbxPJVMpT4H0t9uPsz9Zg&oe=65423694
instagram,"Beyond the fame is a compelling story about a family's rise to success. Though they have numerous achievements, it does not dismiss them from both heartache and pain. The Jones' are what most people would consider the perfect family because of what they have accomplished. Together, they learned a lot about life itself and the hard work it takes to maintain a level of success.

Devin Jones is a businessman who is very successful by his own right. He is married to a beautiful woman by the name of Ashlee and they have 3 awesome children.

Devin stumbled upon distress, which caused conflict in his marriage, in addition to pain, and confusion among his children. Devin failed to consider the most important things in life as he betrays his wife and family. The perfect family doesn't seem so perfect, with infidelity, lost love, self-worth, and dignity. Family is important, and it is the foundation on which we build our lives upon.

Maybe Devin is human after all. Should a mistake shatter everything that he's worked so hard for? Devin must decide to swallow his pride and admit to his wrong doing.

Through growth, maturity, and self-awareness together the Jones family is able to overcome adversity.

instagram,"Do you tend to be pessimistic?
Then you might have an exaggerated expectation that something bad might happen or that things will fall apart.

When as a child you were raised with an exaggerated
expectation that things will go wrong, you learned to
focus on the negative aspects of life pain, death,
 loss, disappointment, conflict, guilt, resentment, un-
 solved problems, potential mistakes, betrayal, while minimizing or neglecting the optimistic aspects. 

- As a result you chroÔøΩnically worry, complain, are vigilant, or indecisive since 
- you fear making mis- takes that might lead to financial collapse, loss, humiliation, or being trapped in a bad situation.

Healing is going from surviving (experiencing unrealistic threats) to thriving (being able to let down your defences to see that nothing bad will happen).

As I think about those specific situations and my own seasons of grief and suffering, I am so grateful that this world is not all there is. No matter how complicated the issue, all of the bad stuff in this world has an end date. There will be a day when there is no more death, disease, hardship, conflict, or sadness. Because of Christ, we will live forever without any of those things. 

We will live in perfect bodies. 
We will have sinless lives. 
We will dwell with our Triune God forever. 

So, no matter how hard it is, we always have hope. This means we can grieve with hope, persevere with hope, and keep showing up for life with hope as we try to put the broken pieces back together.

Because of Christ, there is always hope.

Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.

instagram,"Trump late on Thursday abruptly dropped a lawsuit against his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen as a conflict loomed between the litigation and Trump‚Äôs campaign to win back the White House.

Trump claimed through a spokesperson that he was simply pausing the litigation, but seemed to concede that it had become complicated by the four criminal cases the former president now faces.

A federal magistrate judge had ordered Trump to sit for a deposition in the Cohen suit starting Monday morning in New York. Earlier this week, however, the former president scheduled a campaign rally in New Hampshire for Monday at noon.
Trump had already delayed the deposition twice, and his lawyers had tried to have it scheduled for Sunday. But at a hearing last week, the judge declined to grant that date and insisted on Monday.

Trump aides and lawyers rebuffed questions about the conflicting demands over the past couple of days, but in a court filing around 8 p.m. on Thursday, a Florida-based attorney for Trump, Alejandro Brito, announced that his client was dropping the case.

The one-line filing offered no explanation for the rare courtroom retreat by Trump but said the termination of the suit was ‚Äúwithout prejudice,‚Äù meaning he was reserving the right to re-file it.",,401,"{'like_count': 361, 'comment_count': 40, 'num_users': 25069}",Denise Williams,,2023-10-06 17:21:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/118982620_2074585479340150_5599547092296835167_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=-Ukiac08KtgAX8sxHbt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfALZTspggV97oRapJLx5V0yBxCuWMbUYH1NIlY8cSSsWQ&oe=6559C99F,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyEMfFJALP9/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386891118_212085611735530_3701304503228587039_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=gVqlhpGyCTsAX8FkK7H&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBO3cvUdmpqSHbXKhDf-39sPZsmv4_WEwEYr6WVBkR0ng&oe=652A08C9

instagram,"As only one of two Levantine states flanking the Mediterranean Sea, Lebanon's geographic location is of great interest to the various road, rail, and waterway connectivity projects emerging in West Asia - not only in connecting the region, but as a bridge between Asia and Europe.

A second look, however, reveals a massive land access problem for Lebanon, which can only be reached via the territories of Syria and Occupied Palestine. Clearly then, for Lebanon to actively participate in West Asian connectivity initiatives, it must establish robust links with either of these two countries.

While Palestine is not a practical or feasible option for the time being, Syria remains Lebanon's only territorial means for the import and export of goods. However, more than a decade of conflict in Syria, persisting foreign occupation of its territories, and US-imposed Caesar Act sanctions have posed immense challenges to historic Lebanese-Syrian political and economic relations.

instagram,"In 1889, nearly 100,000 coal miners went on strike in Germany to demand higher wages and shorter workdays. These strikes pushed Emperor Wilhelm II to introduce a labor reform program. He called for a conference with other European leaders on how to manage the growing demands of united workers.

In 1890, European political elites gathered in Germany to attend this conference on labor standards for coal mining and employment limits for women and children. As the conference began, coal miners in England and Wales launched a wage strike that grew to about 260,000 participants, including women and children.

A New York Times article warned of ‚Äúthe possibilities of a gigantic and ruinous labor conflict open[ing] before us‚Äù if coal owners did not accept worker demands.

In the 1900s, Western elites would increasingly invest in alternative, oil-based energy systems to avoid the effective strikes and labor power that characterized coal production.

Hyderabad: Former Indian cricket team captain Mohammad Azharuddin has been disqualified from contesting the Hyderabad Cricket Academy (HCA) elections on grounds of violation of terms.

Azharuddin‚Äôs disqualification was based on the decision made by a committee constituted by the Supreme Court, and headed by Justice Lau Nageshwar Rao, for handling HCA‚Äôs affairs. The committee was formed after reports of brewing differences surfaced between the Azharuddin, who was the president of HCA, and its working members.

Azharuddin was elected president of the association in the last election held in September 2019. His tenure ended a year later. However, he continued to hold the position until Supreme Court appointed a single-member panel to look into the issue.

Former Supreme Court judge Justice L Nageswara Rao removed the former cricketer from the list of voters for HCA polls scheduled this month on the grounds of conflict of interest as he was president of the Deccan Blues Cricket Club while serving as the president of HCA till early this year.

Nageswara Rao wrote to Azharuddin that he was removed from the voter list on the basis of the order passed by him on July 31, 2023.

‚ÄúAccording to the order dated 31-07-2023, all the executive committee members of clubs in which a person/his family members are involved in the management of multiple clubs have been disqualified to either vote/contest in the ensuing elections to the HCA for one term or a period of three years, whichever is greater.

‚ÄúAs you are the President of Deccan Blue Cricket Club according to the information received by the Single Member Committee, you have been disqualified and not included in the voter‚Äôs list,‚Äù reads the letter.

The letter mentions that on September 30, 2022, the supervisory committee appointed by the Supreme Court had asked Azharuddin to collect information relating to the details of all registered clubs which are members of the HCA.

El-Haji has ridden his horse, Pouchou, since 2019. The horse has one blue-blind eye, and is a little nervous when approached from the right. Together, they have travelled from Chad to the remote jungles of northern Congo. 

In Fulani nomad communities, horses are a source of prestige and are believed to bring protection. The small and hardy ponies are used to herd huge groups of cattle. With thousands of animals, these nomads migrate freely across borders, reaching Congo from as far as West Africa and Sudan, searching for pastures.

instagram,"The forests of the Goualougo Triangle in Nouabal√©-Ndoki National Park are among the most remote in the world. Here, in the Congo Sangha Trinational region‚ÄîA UNESCO World Heritage site that encompasses part of the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, and Cameroon‚Äîpristine green landscapes feature old-growth trees, plus important waterways and swamps that are associated with the Ndoki and Goualougo Rivers. 

Many of the animals hadn‚Äôt had much exposure to humans when GTAP began. This allowed researchers to do some important research about ‚Äúfirst contact‚Äù with chimpanzees. It also lets us learn more about how apes operate when there‚Äôs no human-animal conflict to be concerned about, like how they use tools, how they use space, and their group dynamics. 

This type of research allows us to determine what an untouched environment provides for wildlife, and it also helps us make a case for protecting places like Goualougo so more species may thrive. Additionally, it helps us figure out how to be as un-invasive as possible when encroaching on space that animals have been using, free of humans, for a very long time. 

Having a long-term research camp in this area also means being able to make change in a positive way for both local human and animal communities that will last over generations. 

But the importance of this place is so much more than just ‚Äúthe facts.‚Äù David Morgan, Ph.D., the current GTAP director and Lincoln Park zoo research fellow, says that when Dr. Jane Goodall visited back in 2002, she understood. He remembers her saying that it was the forest she dreamed about as a kid‚Äìthat seeing the big trees, large buttresses and the African forest with chimps and gorillas was eye-opening for her.

instagram,"On Thursday, Azerbaijani officials confirmed the reports of the arrest of Arayik Harutyunyan, a former president of Nagorno-Karabakh. Harutyunyan was detained on Tuesday by Azerbaijani authorities on suspicion of waging an aggressive war against Azerbaijan and alleged war crimes. This occurred following Azerbaijan's invasion of the enclave, resulting in its ethnic Armenian authorities disbanding and most of its population fleeing to Armenia. Ruben Vardanyan, a former president of the enclave, and two other former presidents of the separatist region were also arrested on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Armenia's Foreign Ministry condemned Azerbaijan's actions and vowed to protect the rights of the illegally arrested representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, including in international courts. The Azerbaijani government claims to be holding re-integration talks with the former leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh while also initiating criminal investigations against 300 separatist officials. Azerbaijan and Armenia had a 24-hour conflict in September over the ethnic Armenian enclave. This was the fourth major conflict since the Soviet Union dissolved. The conflict ended in one day with the presence of Russian peacekeepers. The United Nations has urged Azerbaijan to respect and protect detainees.

Assessment
It is likely that this will be another dark stain on the history of this area. While it is highly unlikely that Azerbaijan will do anything short of fully militarizing this area and the border near it. While violent, possibly to the point of genocidal now, it is also possible that this switch of territory could lead to a period of peace in the region. However, it is also possible that a change in leadership within Armenia could lead to an attempt to reclaim territory; however, this will be unlikely if they move towards the west.

Vish√º Rita Krocha
Kohima | October 6
 
Even as the Wildlife Week (October 2-8) is being commemorated to increase the awareness among the common mass that there is a ‚Äòsymbiotic relationship between the forest, forest-dwelling animals, ecosystem services, and humans‚Äô, the issue of human-elephant conflict in Wokha has remained one of the most pressing issues confronting Nagaland state in this regard. 
While there is no permanent solution to this according to Hukai H Zhimo, Forester 1, Head of Wildlife Crime Control Unit, Dimapur Wildlife Division, ‚Äúa short-term solution would be setting up anti-depredation squad comprising of 5-6 members per affected village who could guard their fields especially during harvest time.‚Äù He impressed upon that the only chance to minimise the human-animal conflict in the area is to have a committee coming forward from the elephant bearing villages and also increasing fodder species for elephants such as banana, bamboos.

Across borders and boundaries, an Alliance forms. Reborn in the Hearts of Knights long lost on the Lone Wolf path, the Song of Avalon arises again, calling each to the Table. The Priestesses, ever Stewards of the Sacred Councils, dance the Kingdoms together in a whirlwind of playful harmony. And so Sword and Chalice, Staff and Stone, come together again.

The Altar of the Dragon is laced with Roses, sweet candles catching the night, lights glistening upon bare steel and golden chalices, gleaming crystals and elegant wands. From Magi to Mastery, the way of the Tuatha De Danann sees the gifts of abundance in all forms of change, revealing their mysterious Mythos. Listen to the Elements, look deep into the shadows, and illuminate the darkness with the Light of Eternal Love‚Ä¶

So mote it Be, that we be Blessed

Ruhail Qaisar‚Äôs Fatima is a requiem for a dead future. The debut album release by the self-taught artist and producer screams with the trauma and decay of life in his hometown of Leh‚Äîa high-altitude plateau region in the contested Ladakh area, extending from the Himalayan to the Kunlun Ranges. Qaisar absorbs this external condition of perpetual conflict between nation states into his internal life and resulting compositions, crossing sound art, noise music and experimental filmmaking. Hauntological drones, power electronics and convulsive post-industrial dissonance create an unnerving sense of fear, anger, and alienation. A broken transistor with a knob tuned to the abyss is bombarded with the cries and bitter laughter of a city‚Äôs inhabitants tyrannized, not only by military occupation but the soft-power subjugation of the tourism industry.

Signs of a healthy relationship:
‚úÖBoth partners take responsibility for wrong behavior without making excuses and blaming others. 
‚úÖRespectful conversation is used to resolve conflict. 
‚úÖThere is mutual respect. 
‚úÖThere is trust and freedom to be who you are. 
‚úÖTime with family/friends is encouraged. 

Signs of an unhealthy relationship:
‚ùåOne person makes all the decisions without regard to the other partner. 
‚ùåThere is possessiveness, jealous, controlling behavior.
‚ùåThere are unpredictable and extreme mood changes.
‚ùåOne person is constantly doing hurtful things then apologizes, but does not permanently change.

I joined a gym three weeks ago and have been LOVING the 6:30 aqua aerobics but just got an email that the pool is closing for repairs.

I am trying (semi-successfully) to give my college son as much space as he needs and not be passive aggressive about wishing he‚Äôd call or FaceTime more. The first year requires this break, I think, but, God, I miss him: his ideas, his hugs, his sense of humor and bright light in our home.

Just heard there is a freeze warning for tonight‚Äîwith so many dahlia still about to bloom and lots of green tomatoes. 

And yet‚Ä¶

I have never worked for a better team and the current madness makes me appreciate our norm. Words of affirmation are my love language and I‚Äôm constantly receiving them in this role (yes, a tiny voice wants to say ‚Äúkeep the praise and show me the money‚Äù).

These dahlias exceeded my expectations and we‚Äôll collect the green tomatoes and give thanks for a good garden year.

My youngest is excelling in school and at his job WITHOUT any micromanagement from me. We have moments of conflict but recover quickly and I can see him maturing this year so much.

Bri and I celebrated 33 years as a couple this week and he still makes me laugh when not making me crazy.  I still find him irresistible and being beside him is my greatest source of peace. How lucky!

I got to chat with two of my oldest friends this week, to rant and laugh‚Äîoh so good for my soul!

After highlighting other prize winners this week, here are some Newbery Winners and nominees. If I had to read ALL the winners of any prize, this is the one I‚Äôd choose.

WILDLIFE AND WILDERNESS IN THE NORTH
Largely ignored but of vital value
 
By Dr S Wijeyamohan
6 pm, 19th October 2023, Jasmine Hall, BMICH
 
 
 
 
On the ending of the war in 2009, immediate visitors to the North and the East were astonished at the sight of pristine forests, unlike many left in the remainder of the country, intact and preserved and beautiful, vast tracts of forest and large numbers of wildlife endured.
 
That was 14 years ago, and the narration has changed since. Today, there are reports of rampant deforestation and the killing of wildlife taking place here. Human-elephant Conflict has reached levels never seen before.
 
Yet, just as during the War, information on this barely trickles through to the general public and they remain blissfully unaware that the Nation‚Äôs Natural Wealth is being ravaged here, as it is in much of the rest of the island, at a rate never seen before. Are these areas, freed with considerable human and financial cost, all to be destroyed in a couple of decades? What of the revenue these wonderful places and creatures could bring to the country, and the local communities, if they are protected and shown off to the World? Are we to sacrifice the future on the altar of greed?,
 
Dr. S. Wijeyamohan is well known in conservation circles as someone who has long championed the cause of conservation in the North and the East. Specializing in Wildlife Ecology, Conservation and Management, he is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Bio-science of the University of Vavuniya. There can be none better than Dr. Wijeyamohan to help us understand the reality, and lift the fog of ignorance of these vastly biodiverse, and increasingly threatened, vitally precious areas of this Nation.
 
The monthly lecture of the WNPS is supported by the Nations Trust Bank. It is open to both members and non-members, ENTRANCE FREE.

So lucky to be doing this with my incredible hairy peach hulk husband @t_roy_127 we have survived a long prep together.

üß° October is National Bullying Prevention Month! These 5 questions will help prepare your kids with the knowledge they need to stand up for themselves if they're faced with bullying.

1Ô∏è‚É£ What do you think is the difference between bullying and having a conflict with someone? What would you do if you had a conflict you couldn't resolve on your own?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Cyberbullying happens when someone says mean things about someone else online. Have you ever seen someone do that? What happened?

3Ô∏è‚É£ What adults do you trust at school to get help with bullying? What would you say to them if you saw or experienced bullying?

4Ô∏è‚É£ One way to stop a bully is to say something funny and redirect the conversation. What's something funny you could say to redirect a bully?

5Ô∏è‚É£ Questioning a bully's behavior can help put a stop to it. How do you think a bully would respond if you asked them why they're picking on someone?

instagram,"Yesterday our Students faced the core event of the European Master in Disaster Medicine Residential Course: the Full Scale Exercise. This large simulation took place in Solbiate Olona (Varese, Italy) where the Italian Army deployed a ROLE 3 field hospital.

In the simulated scenario of a post-conflict unstable peace, a sudden heavy storm hit a festival area where many people were gathered. Our master students did their best to respond to the Mass Casualty Incident and coordinate all the forces that came into play to handle the pressure of an already stressed hospital and to save as many lives as possible.

Huge thanks to the City of Solbiate Olona who hosted us, the 150 medical students who played the role of smart victims and the hundreds professionals and volunteers from firefighters, AREU Lombardia, Italian Red Cross Varese and Novara and many more.

Many thanks to @tabiomac for the awesome pictures.

instagram,"Today in 1973, the Yom Kippur War begins. Lasting until October 25, this conflict began when an Arab Coalition, led by Egypt and Syria, attacked Israel. Following the Third Arab-Israeli War (also known as the Six-Day War) in 1967, Egypt and Syria had hoped to recover lost land that was gained by Israel. In 1972, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat expelled 20,000 Soviet advisors from Egypt, and sought new diplomatic relations with Washington DC, in an effort to obtain future hope of peace with Israel. On October 6, 1973, Egyptian and Syrian forces launched an attack against Israel on Yom Kippur. With the conflict occurring mostly around Golan Heights and the Sinai, Egyptian forces fought to keep control of the Suez Canal, while Israeli soldiers launched a major counteroffensive in Syria. The end result was an Israeli military victory, while Egypt and Syria won certain political gains. Five years later, the Camp David Accords were signed in Washington DC, which brought about a new era of peace between Israel and Egypt. On October 6, 1981, Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Islamic extremists in Cairo. #todayinhistory #history",,167,"{'like_count': 167, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 14195}",Garrett Smith,,2023-10-06 13:16:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/343281456_1262780097956508_2976504686011375395_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=d3v-9VXrskYAX_eXm5w&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAVUAu17GmX07TBKcapwBaezsiXwo50wk_6iV4a_Cda1g&oe=655AA65A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyDwfhluovH/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386172475_280396834955890_6280990495121067753_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=vYEaJ9aEORcAX8JRhTM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAX4P2FTHnQjyM0seV62HU7D5bVXkdudcxCbV_5Fw0M-A&oe=653C42E4

instagram,"There was a time when I didn‚Äôt take life stressors seriously. ( okay there are still times I don't, but I am working on it.)

I was doing crossfit 6 days a week, running 40 miles a week and only sleeping about 5hrs a night because I worked a physical job that started at 5:30am and I thought I would just sleep when I was dead. 

And to top it off, I was confused as to why I felt like shit. (LOL) 

It wasn‚Äôt until I took a step back from intense training that I started to realize just how awful I felt. I was tired, irritable, and I wasn‚Äôt even making any progress. It was time for a change. 

Stress is part of being human. 

It is what pushes us to grow and adapt, but if you don‚Äôt recover from it properly, it can start to impact your health/progress. 

You might think ‚Äúif stress is part of being human then why should I worry about it.‚Äù 

Just like with everything else, we need to find a balance with stress. Too much or too little is not a good thing. 

Stressors you need to pay attention to: 
üëâphysical ‚Äî e.g., poor sleep, illness, injury, dehydration, hunger, etc.
üëâmental, or cognitive ‚Äî e.g., information overload, too many decisions, solving difficult problems, etc.
üëâemotional ‚Äî e.g., painful emotions such as guilt, sadness, anger, etc.
üëâsocial ‚Äî e.g., conflict with family and friends, loneliness, discrimination, etc.
üëâexistential, or spiritual ‚Äî e.g., hopelessness, crises of faith or identity, etc.
üëâenvironmental, or what‚Äôs around us ‚Äî e.g., temperature, pollution, noise, safety, etc.

A stressor can be anything that disrupts homeostasis, or our ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù. Stressors can occur in any part of life, and they can affect people differently. 

All of these stressors can impact your progress in different ways. Don‚Äôt brush them off or ignore them. Stay aware of your stress levels and make sure you have healthy ways of coping.

instagram,"Day 8 of my 21-day #GratitudeOnChain journey: Grateful for @ashna.8ters ü•∞

This is my journey to express gratitude on blockchain in a permanent, immutable way.

I was pregnant with Ashna a quarter into my MBA. @devanandreddy and I were upgraded to a 2-bedroom on the Stanford campus. Before Ashna‚Äôs first bath, we bought half the store‚Äôs detergent to deep-clean. We flew to Pittsburgh for her hair shaving ceremony. We call it ‚Äúour most expensive haircut.‚Äù

Ashna is one of the biggest blessings of our lives. @ariyareddy_ , your turn is coming next, eww

ü•∞ She has impeccable timing. Ashna was born a week before the 2nd year of biz school. One of my must-attend courses was Dr. Burgelman and Andy Grove‚Äôs ‚ÄúStrategy is Action‚Äù. The course allowed us to miss 2 classes. With Dev and mom‚Äôs support, I was back in class two weeks after, missing exactly 2.

ü•∞ She is my calm-factor, my moral compass, she stretches my ability to handle conflict, is an excellent communicator and is always the first to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù.

Of all the decisions I have made, the hardest was her daycare. When I handed Ashna over, tears streaming down my face, the caregiver said, ‚ÄúThe baby will eat, sleep and repeat. She will be fine. You need to figure out if YOU will be fine.‚Äù

Fast forward, as I was stressed about my to-do list, Ashna said, ‚ÄúMom, you have always had so much to do. And you always get it done really well. Chill.‚Äù This has become my go-to phrase. It always works out üòÖ

ü•∞ She stays true to herself

When she was 9-years old, she was asked to write about who inspires her. She wrote: ‚ÄúInspiration coming from within.‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

She studied at a top STEM high-school, and decided to major in Design. This broke many Asian stereotypes, especially given our STEM household. Dev and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder.

Ashna- Thank you for the gift of motherhood. Thank you for who you are. I am thrilled to express my love and #GratitudeOnChain.

instagram,"""But sometimes my child just has to get with the program!"" 

Who's program are we talking about here? 
Externally imposed structures are usually designed without neurodivergence in mind, and directly conflict with the structures neurodivergent need to regulate themselves.
As parents and caregivers, you are in the difficult position of being responsible for putting in structures to help your autistic child thrive. 

It can be a big change in thinking to realise that the structures, routines and rituals neurodivergent people put in place may actually be serving a helpful purpose.
 
Many people instinctively see these as being bad or symptoms of disorder so then try to train the person out of it or discipline them for doing this. This is quite harmful to neurodivergent people. 

Instead of imposing rigid rules that take away your child's coping strategies, it is better to work collaboratively to first understand why neurodivergent people are doing what they are doing, and then working with them to develop structures that best support their growth and ability to thrive.

Blessed that I have made it this far as it‚Äôs a privilege denied to many. 

üé®‚ú® Getting older is underrated and I wish someone would have told me how glorious being a crone can be! It‚Äôs the sleeper hit aspect of the triple goddess.

üéÇ I love getting older!
Aging is akin to possessing a time-traveling magic: I carry within me the 13-year-old's curiosity, the 21-year-old's adventure the 36-year-old's passion, and the 42-year-old's resilience. With each passing year, these portals to the past open wide, allowing me to revisit the moments when I dangled my legs from my Caribbean treehouse or shimmied in a Moroccan restaurant in the Village, NYC. üåÜüíÉ
And what a canvas I've become! Freckles, stretch marks, tattoos, wrinkles, birthmarks, and scars - these are not imperfections; they are the artistic brushstrokes of a life richly lived, a story beautifully told. 
Aging has gifted me a crown of freedom. Gone are the days of unnecessary drama, conflict, or stress. I've mastered the art of serenity, even if you tell me 1+1=5 - in my world, you're absolutely right! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüéâ
Life's storms, which once left me waiting for the sun, now find me grateful in the eye of the tempest. As I've matured, I've embraced the idea that the storm itself, with all its chaos, is a vital part of the journey. üå™Ô∏è
My days are now spacious, free from the tyranny of multitasking. I relish the present moment, allowing my spirit to move through life's rhythms at its own pace. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Growing older has also deepened my compassion for others. I see the threads that weave us together, recognizing that in our shared humanity, we all bear our burdens, chase our dreams, and grapple with inner critics. We are one. üåç‚ù§Ô∏è

GOAT OF WESTERN CINEMA !!! Oh the maestro strikes again.  Sergio Leone is simply the üêê in this Western cinema. No other filmmakers can make a wild west era film like Sergio Leone. He is simply on his own. Damn iconic, damn good.

Leone knows best how to display conflicts in those cowboys era, how the characters set revenge towards one another, and how they unleash their wraths with style. Backed with another masterpiece composing by Ennio Morricone. There are probably 3-4 amazing scorings here that I can listen & listen again. I can never get enough of them.

Here we follow the conflicts between few opposing parties (just like his other films). From a harmonica man, a serial killer, a widow, and a bandit. Together they form a tale that is worth our time - from discussing business aspect, territorial disputes, childhood memory, and finally revenge business. 

There are many slowmos that made this film greater than it already is, especially that first scene & last scene. Oh damn it was probably my top 5 endings of all time. The way everything unfolds in the end bring me to wonder how he did that. Charles Bronson and Fonda performances even made it even more iconic.

Hats off to one of my top 3 Western films of all time. this film stood up there alongside 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' & 'No Country For Old Men'. Notice 2 of them are coming from Sergio Leone. What a film, what a conflict, and what a conclusion. This film is simply something else.

One of the best of cinema üêê",,117,"{'like_count': 104, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 3226}",K Film Review,,2023-10-06 04:33:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/391293681_730876495553725_4710466880179663318_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=dEeBEa6NNlcAX-wpriJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDt_4yavTo1nFQlOMWq_Mz0o2dlTXHC7WsFXTH2X4KKig&oe=655B4C1B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyC0kz5vXkz/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386115033_581664700692511_6042271443757037317_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=r2_IxPCFDVQAX806nPe&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAqgJnACNbjWadlFAK1lJh4raTXBZQhD5eCir8HM3YK3Q&oe=653D25C8

A Divided Duty by Ben Vizzard
Genre: Mystery/Thriller/Romance/History
Pages: 292

Q6-CHAPTER 12

WOULD YOU HAVE FOLLOWED GABRIELLA?

Sorry, I wouldn't. I wasn't convinced by her plan. It would have been better if she had prepared more for what she was about to do. There is no way I would have put my life or the lives of my family in danger for it. 

Blurb:
Declared unfit for active service after the Great War, Richard Hansen feels rudderless and out of place. But when the unthinkable happens, and the shadow of a new conflict looms, he is thrust into enemy territory once again for a final, covert mission.

Devastated and mourning her own catastrophic losses, his wife Emily is alone and adrift in a once-idyllic marriage grown cold and distant. When one day, a surprise visitor comes calling, she is faced with a choice that may grant her the very thing she has always longed for‚Ä¶ or lead her into terrible danger.

As Europe goes to war a second time and Richard and Emily‚Äôs paths are wrenched apart, each must confront the ghosts of their own past, battling forces both seen and unseen as their lifelong love is tested to its limits - by duty, grief, time, and betrayal.

instagram,"One of the top things I wanted to do in Sarajevo was to go to the top of Trebeviƒá mountain by cable car and explore the old Olympic bobsled track. The cable car station is near the City Hall, although it's up so many steps that you might feel like you've climbed the mountain before you even get to the cable car ü§£ 

The original cable car opened in 1959 and was used for the Winter Olympics in 1984. This stopped running before the war, and was completely destroyed in the conflict. The one you see today is only a few years old. 

On the top of the mountain there are lots of walking and mountain biking trails but the main attractions are the views over Sarajevo and the abandoned Olympic bobsled track. The track saw lots of fighting during the Bosnian war but is still relatively intact, although covered in graffiti. That night when we got back to the hotel I watched footage of it being used for the Olympics - like a lot of things in Sarajevo, it's fascinating to see but mixed with sadness for what happened during the war.

Berliner Herbstsalons dieses Wochenende weiter. Wir freuen uns besonders auf das anschlie√üende Q&A in Anwesenheit der Regisseur*innen an allen drei Abenden: 

In ùóîùó£ùóõùóîùó¶ùóúùóî untersucht ùóùùó≤ùóπùó≤ùóªùóÆ ùóùùòÇùóøùó≤≈°ùóÆ die Wiederholung kollektiver Verbrechen und die Konstruktion nationaler Identit√§ten.

Unterschiedliche zeitliche Perspektiven auf den Konflikt im ehemaligen Jugoslawien kommen auch am Samstag zusammen: Wir zeigen Filme von ≈†ùóÆùóµùó∂ùóª ≈†ùó∂≈°ùó∂ƒá und ùóöùóºùóøùóÆùóª ùóóùó≤ùòÉùó∂ƒá.

Der Film von ≈Ωùó∂ùòÉùóºùó∑ùó∂ùóª ùó£ùóÆùòÉùóπùóºùòÉùó∂ƒá aus dem Jahr 1967 zeigt die Geschichte eines jungen Vagabunden, der als Saisonarbeiter arbeitet, und gilt als eines der ikonoklastischen Werke der jugoslawischen vague noir ‚Äì am Sonntag im Gorki zu sehen.

After opening with the Oscar-commended ùó§ùó®ùó¢ ùó©ùóîùóóùóúùó¶, ùóîùóúùóóùóî? by ùóùùóÆùòÄùó∫ùó∂ùóπùóÆ ≈ΩùóØùóÆùóªùó∂ƒá, the film programme as part of the 6. Berliner Herbstsalon continues this weekend. We are especially looking forward to the Q&A afterwards in the presence of the directors on all three evenings:

In ùóîùó£ùóõùóîùó¶ùóúùóî, ùóùùó≤ùóπùó≤ùóªùóÆ ùóùùòÇùóøùó≤≈°ùóÆ explores the repetition of collective crimes and the construction of national identities. Gorki will juxtapose the film with a work by ùóùùó≤ùóÆùóª-ùóüùòÇùó∞ ùóöùóºùó±ùóÆùóøùó± in a screening on Friday.

Different temporal perspectives on the conflict in the former Yugoslavia also come together on Saturday: We will show films by ≈†ùóÆùóµùó∂ùóª ≈†ùó∂≈°ùó∂ƒá and and ùóöùóºùóøùóÆùóª ùóóùó≤ùòÉùó∂ƒá.

The film by ≈Ωùó∂ùòÉùóºùó∑ùó∂ùóª ùó£ùóÆùòÉùóπùóºùòÉùó∂ƒá from 1967 tells the story of a young vagabond who works as a seasonal labourer, and is considered one of the iconoclastic works of the Yugoslavian vague noir - on view at Gorki on Sunday.

Rating: 4.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è 

‚ÄúI secretly love romantic comedies despite what I said earlier about classic films, and I think I was a miserably unhappy person until I met you.‚Äù

Guys, this was so lovely ü•πü•π. My favorite romcom of all time is 50 First Dates and that‚Äôs totally the vibe this book gave me.

Every night Gemma goes to bed she forgets all about Jack, this handsome wonderful man who has been trying to win her heart every single day‚Ä¶ whilst stuck in a time loop. Every night Gemma‚Äôs memories are wiped clean, and every day Jack falls more in love with her and is more determined to break the loop & get her to remember him.

I loved the drama, the family conflict (and resolutions), and the dynamic between Gemma and her best friend Lila. This book has so much heart to it and touched me deeply. I really felt like I could connect and relate to some of the struggles the characters were dealing with, and this book also genuinely made me laugh multiple times. 

I loved the whole sci-fi aspect of this romance and I also really enjoyed the narration. From the first chapter I was hooked. ‚ÄúPlease remember me, Gemma.‚Äù Ugh, my heart. 

This book was just a really good time & stands out from the other romances I‚Äôve read. 

I love a unique romance & this one will definitely stay on my mind for a long time!

The Irish republicanism movement ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

__
During the Cold War in Europe - It was following the outbreak of The Troubles in 1966 / August 1969, the Irish republicanism movement had split between the Official Irish Republican Army (Official IRA) and the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) at the beginning of 1970. 

__
Both groups were initially involved in an armed conflict against the British Army, but the Official IRA later moved into mainstream politics after their official ceasefire in 1972, the associated 'Official Sinn F√©in' eventually renamed itself The Workers' Party (active in the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland in the UK). 

__
The Provisional Irish Republican Army, except during brief ceasefires with the British Armed Forces in 1972 and 1975, kept up its campaign of violence for nearly thirty years. It was directed against British soldiers and police and commercial targets (especially businesses) in the 1970s, 1980s, and until early 1998.

instagram,"Conflict has forced these people to seek shelter in a disaster zone. 

As fighting rages in neighboring Sudan, hundreds of thousands have fled to parts of South Sudan already struggling to contain alarming rates of extreme hunger with limited resources. Most making this desperate journey are originally from South Sudan but were living as refugees across the border when war broke out. 

Returning to the country they fled years ago is not a straightforward affair. Some families arrive at crowded transit centers with children who are fighting for their lives due to severe malnutrition. They then have to make multi-day treks by boat and overland transport just to reach temporary shelters. 

To help people reeling from the impact of these overlapping crises, we‚Äôre helping the UN @worldfoodprogramme deliver emergency food assistance and administer treatment for malnutrition at transit centers and locations where returnees finally arrive. With support from @usaid and other donors, the UN agency has already reached 265,000 vulnerable people with life-saving aid, with more help on the way.

instagram,"The history of Rwanda is painful to process- Prior to the colonial era, Tutsis generally occupied the higher strata in the social system and the Hutus the lower. However, social mobility was possible, a Hutu who acquired a large number of cattle or other wealth could be assimilated into the Tutsi group and impoverished Tutsi would be regarded as Hutu. A clan system also functioned, with the Tutsi clan known as the Nyinginya being the most powerful. Throughout the 1800s, the Nyingiya expanded their influence by conquest and by offering protection in return for tribute.

By 1962, when Rwanda gained independence, 120,000 people, primarily Tutsis, had taken refuge in neighboring states to escape the violence which had accompanied the gradual coming into power of the Hutu community.

A new cycle of ethnic conflict and violence continued after independence. Tutsi refugees in Tanzania and Zaire seeking to regain their former positions in Rwanda began organizing and staging attacks on Hutu targets and the Hutu government.
The attacks were one of the factors leading to the war between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo that took place in 1996. Former Rwandan forces continue to operate in the DRC alongside Congolese militia and other armed groups. They continue to target civilian populations and cause deaths, injury and harm. On 6 April 1994, the deaths of the Presidents of Burundi and Rwanda in a plane crash caused by a rocket attack, ignited several weeks of intense and systematic massacres. The killings - more than one million people are estimated to have perished - shocked the international community and were clearly acts of genocide. An estimated 150,000 to 250,000 women were also raped. Members of the presidential guard started killing Tutsi civilians in a section of Kigali near the airport. Less than half an hour after the plane crash, roadblocks manned by Hutu militiamen often assisted by gendarmerie (paramilitary police) or military personnel were set up to identify Tutsis

This film explores the profound connection between the fates of Syria and Lebanon through a dialogue with Samar Yazbek, a prominent Syrian writer and activist living in exile in Paris. Over eight years, the film delves into the question of whether cinema and literature can make a difference in the face of war and what it means to bear witness as a writer. Instead of focusing on the spectacle of war, the film uses a layered approach, combining various elements like images, sounds, music, and text to reveal the inner world of the writer. As the conflict intensifies, the film grapples with the dilemma of whether to speak out or remain silent. The film ultimately presents a poignant and politically relevant testimony of our troubled times through the dialogue between two women artists.

Arab Cinema Week is organized in partnership with Safar Film Festival @safarfilmfestival

Wang Du was in Paris when the war in Kosovo broke out in 1998. Reading Western European newspapers as well as coverage from outlets in Yugoslavia, he noticed that different narratives about the war were being told. Wang began to collect daily reports and analyses, creating an assemblage of papers with plastic toy tanks, ships, and fighter jets. Busts of American president Bill Clinton and Russian president Boris Yeltsin appear embedded within this carefully landscaped battlefield. The work's title, which translates from French as 'armchair strategy', describes the position of a distant observer whose idle talk is based entirely on media reportage. Wang creates a war zone in which alternate truths engage in conflict. #M+ #M+museum #hongkong #art #news #fakenews #lifeevents #media #journalism #ronagam",,36,"{'like_count': 36, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 10415}",Ron Agam,,2023-10-06 10:40:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/285161896_406649314678692_4629401018424985092_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=1qBA989clqIAX8ZI8sX&_nc_oc=AQkzTTFwQljAv3P8pkq0MrkYHgJS2cYGq3FXMqr9WZmcC44kGlWYhjQ_jZTy17w2DSM&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC1WmsJS9HKJP8mkrYNBCtsFc6MZFvznW2AU9Bai12Q1g&oe=655A2155,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyDelvwrMRT/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386875574_284946277706579_6830825021477308289_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fBW2MVGRXDIAX90tuJF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBNfzWEZ9FhuHTAta16zFhpV9N7r_vJrfs9V844ljZi_g&oe=65409C85

Lydia shared that they have created a comprehensive plan to bring the community closer, including engaging activities. They organized movie nights and homemade ice cream gatherings to strengthen their bond. Moreover, they've struck a balance by incorporating productivity-enhancing events like study nights alongside fun-filled adventures such as a Halloween-themed spooky hike.

When asked about their training as RAs, they emphasized the diverse range of skills they have acquired, including proficiency in Title IX and conflict resolution. Mahali stressed the importance of gaining hands-on experience and understanding their unique student demographic and the flow of events to ensure their success as RAs. Dale, addressing the challenge of a growing student body and a consistent number of RAs, stresses the importance of inclusivity and reaching out to various student groups.

For the second year in a row, we have been providing vocational training opportunities for conflict-affected women in Barda, Aghjabadi and Tartar.
60 women successfully completed ""Using Microsoft Office programmes"" üíªcourse, which we organized together with Barda Vocational Lyceum for members of the Women's Resource Centers located in 3 regions. The course covered Microsoft Word, Excel, and Power Point programmes.

At the next stage, women will master their skills in accounting. 60 women are expected to complete the #vocational course on accounting.

These vocational courses are being organized as part of the ‚ÄúEmpowering and creating equal opportunities for vulnerable, conflict-affected women in Azerbaijan to overcome barriers towards greater economic and social participation (ECEO)‚Äù project implemented by UNDP and SCFWCA with the financial support of the UK Government.

instagram,"New @unicef and Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre research found that at least 43 million children have been displaced by extreme weather in the last six years. This is a tragic injustice.

Climate displacement is particularly traumatic for children ‚Äì they are far more exposed to risk than adults, and when displaced, they lose access to critical education, health services, and community.

This image is of Dadaab refugee camp, which houses refugees fleeing conflict and climate-induced drought in Somalia. The analysis found the greatest proportion of child displacements were in both small-island states and here, in the Horn of Africa.

Children are disproportionately impacted by the #ClimateCrisis, yet most climate policy fails to consider them.

Current legal protections for climate refugees are not adequate. Leaders must come to an international agreement to protect all climate refugees, particularly children. The voices of young people must also be heard and included in the policy-making process.

instagram,"The history of Rwanda is painful to process- Prior to the colonial era, Tutsis generally occupied the higher strata in the social system and the Hutus the lower. However, social mobility was possible, a Hutu who acquired a large number of cattle or other wealth could be assimilated into the Tutsi group and impoverished Tutsi would be regarded as Hutu. A clan system also functioned, with the Tutsi clan known as the Nyinginya being the most powerful. Throughout the 1800s, the Nyingiya expanded their influence by conquest and by offering protection in return for tribute.

By 1962, when Rwanda gained independence, 120,000 people, primarily Tutsis, had taken refuge in neighboring states to escape the violence which had accompanied the gradual coming into power of the Hutu community.

A new cycle of ethnic conflict and violence continued after independence. Tutsi refugees in Tanzania and Zaire seeking to regain their former positions in Rwanda began organizing and staging attacks on Hutu targets and the Hutu government.
The attacks were one of the factors leading to the war between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo that took place in 1996. Former Rwandan forces continue to operate in the DRC alongside Congolese militia and other armed groups. They continue to target civilian populations and cause deaths, injury and harm. On 6 April 1994, the deaths of the Presidents of Burundi and Rwanda in a plane crash caused by a rocket attack, ignited several weeks of intense and systematic massacres. The killings - more than one million people are estimated to have perished - shocked the international community and were clearly acts of genocide. An estimated 150,000 to 250,000 women were also raped. Members of the presidential guard started killing Tutsi civilians in a section of Kigali near the airport. Less than half an hour after the plane crash, roadblocks manned by Hutu militiamen often assisted by gendarmerie (paramilitary police) or military personnel were set up to identify Tutsis

‚ùó CrisisWatch is a vital tool for anyone trying to stay abreast of and understand the world‚Äôs shifting conflict landscape.

üóì It provides monthly summaries of political and security developments in over 70 conflicts, crises and vulnerable countries.

üåé When it was created in September 2003, CrisisWatch‚Äôs first early warning bulletin covered about 50 situations of conflict. Today, CrisisWatch covers about 70 conflicts and also monitors major developments in another 40-50 situations.

üóÑ Our database, which contains 18k entries dating all the way back to 2003, reflects our dedication to early warning work and also serves as a valuable source of historical analysis.

We are also proud to announce that we have revamped CrisisWatch to offer greater clarity on what we track and how we make our qualitative assessments.

üÜï Every CrisisWatch entry now explores conflict trends through the following features:

‚úÖ Summary of key political and security developments in an opening bolded line for each conflict, w/ a transparent analysis of how we assessed the situation.

‚úÖ Our analysis is broken down into multiple thematic issues; with a short sentence in italics to introduce each theme.

üó∫ We have also revamped our interactive map with new vibrant colours that help users navigate global conflict situations quickly and easily.

üîé These changes offer readers greater visibility on the local, regional and global dynamics that shape conflicts, including some that may be ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù.

instagram,"Aproape 50 de lideri europeni reuni»õi joi »ôi vineri la Cordoba, √Æn Spania, dar Ilham Aliev, autoritarul pre»ôedinte al Azerbaidjanului, a preferat sƒÉ nu participe. Dar »ôi pre»ôedintele Turciei, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, omite reuniunea ComunitƒÉ»õii Politice Europene (CPE) pentru a doua oarƒÉ consecutiv, d√¢nd vina pe o rƒÉcealƒÉ.

P√¢nƒÉ √Æn aceastƒÉ sƒÉptƒÉm√¢nƒÉ, liderii UE au tot sperat cƒÉ vor putea reaprinde discu»õiile de pace dintre Ilham Aliyev din Azerbaidjan »ôi Nikol Pashinian din Armenia la aceastƒÉ √Ænt√¢lnire din Spania. Dar ini»õiativa a e»ôuat »ôi acum nu existƒÉ niciun rezultat pentru √Ænt√¢lnire. CPE ‚Äûse destramƒÉ ‚Äù, a spus un √Ænalt oficial al UE.

O parte a problemei este cƒÉ scopul CPE nu a fost √Æn realitate niciodatƒÉ clarificat - Comunitatea a fost √Æn»õeleasƒÉ mai ales ca un atelier de discu»õii, o salƒÉ de a»ôteptare pentru aspiran»õii membri ai UE sau ca un forum regional pentru liderii europeni pentru a lua decizii »ôi a ajunge la reducerea tensiunilor. DacƒÉ oricare dintre acestea a fost scopul propus al ComunitƒÉ»õii Politice Europene, deocamdatƒÉ ea e»ôueazƒÉ la toate trei.

√én mod clar, CPE a e»ôuat √Æn atenuarea conflictelor. Una dintre pu»õinele ini»õiative lansate la un summit CPE a fost trimiterea unei misiuni UE la grani»õa Armeniei cu Azerbaidjanul. Dar conflictul s-a extins atunci c√¢nd Baku a lansat recenta ofensivƒÉ militarƒÉ fulger pentru a prelua controlul asupra regiunii Nagorno-Karabah, duc√¢nd la un exod √Æn masƒÉ al etnicilor armeni din regiunea separatistƒÉ.

Dar nu e singurul conflict: √Æn vreme ce pre»ôedin»õii din Kosovo »ôi Serbia participƒÉ am√¢ndoi, oficialii UE »ôi din Kosovo au spus cƒÉ CPE nu este forumul potrivit pentru un dialog, deoarece ar trebui sƒÉ se poarte discu»õii √Æntre pre»ôedintele s√¢rb Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá »ôi premierul kosovar Albin Kurti, care nu participƒÉ la reuniunea CPE. (Kosovo »ôi-a trimis √Æn schimb pre»ôedinta, pe Vjosa Osmani, care de»õine o func»õie √Æn mare mƒÉsurƒÉ ceremonialƒÉ.)

Sus»õinƒÉtorii CPE sus»õin cƒÉ este mare nevoie de mai multƒÉ coordonare √Æn domeniul securitƒÉ»õii pe continent. Dar √Æntrebarea este dacƒÉ mai multe asemenea formate, institu»õii »ôi summit-uri ceremoniale conduc √Æntr-adevƒÉr la mai multƒÉ coordonare.

Blurb 
A consummate warrior and brilliant strategist, Pino is a young Native American woman who must fight against fierce invaders to save her tribe ‚Äî and spirit ‚Äî from annihilation in precolonial southern New England.

The strange tale of sisterhood begins on the stormy spring morning her tribe faces imminent attack by a contingent of the mighty Pagassett Nation, infamous for destroying small tribes in its quest for land and power. Pino knows this is the moment she‚Äôs been waiting for, a chance to save her people and maybe ‚Äîmaybe ‚Äî redeem herself for failing to rescue her beloved sister, murdered ten summers ago.

Aided by her best warrior and forbidden love, Tow, and key tribal leaders who witness Pino‚Äôs gift for camouflage, she clandestinely influences strategy in the short, but wildly intense conflict. She soon discovers her real opposition is Meesha, a beautiful near-slave taken in by the invading tribe when just a girl. By learning how the other operates, the women form an intimate, almost magical sisterhood in their internal fight to free their inner demons.

instagram,"Thank you for a lovely review, Om Sen.

""The Eternal Love Story"" by Aatmn Parmar is a unique and thought-provoking exploration of spiritual growth and the transformative power of love. This book takes readers on a journey that seamlessly blends personal and spiritual development with a captivating narrative.

At the heart of the story are Sarah, a soul in search of a Guru, and a young Indian entrepreneur who becomes the catalyst for her inner transformation. Author's storytelling skillfully weaves together their experiences, making it a compelling and engaging read.

One of the strengths of this book is its ability to convey complex spiritual concepts in an accessible and relatable manner. Through the characters' journeys, readers are invited to contemplate the fusion of material and spiritual aspects of life, and the idea of discovering the ""Guru Within"" is both inspiring and enlightening.

The characters are well-developed, and their personal growth and evolution throughout the story are portrayed with depth and authenticity. Sarah's journey from disillusionment to self-realization, guided by her interactions with the Indian entrepreneur, is a central theme that resonates with readers on multiple levels.

""The Eternal Love Story"" successfully navigates the balance between spirituality and the material world, offering readers a fresh perspective on how these two aspects can complement each other rather than being in conflict. The book encourages readers to embrace life's challenges and experiences as opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

Aatmn Parmar's writing style is engaging and immersive, making it easy for readers to become emotionally invested in the characters and their journeys. The narrative is filled with moments of insight and wisdom, making it a valuable read for spiritual seekers and those looking to deepen their understanding of the human experience.

instagram,"Parenting, whether it‚Äôs a shared journey or a solo expedition, is a complex dance of influences shaping our children‚Äôs behavior and emotional landscape.

For those navigating this path with a partner, the dynamics between caregivers become a silent yet potent teacher. Every interaction, every disagreement, and every tender moment is a lesson absorbed by young, impressionable minds.

üß† Children are deep observers, internalizing the nuances of love, conflict, and communication unfolding before them. It‚Äôs not about crafting a facade of perfection but fostering an environment of awareness, growth, and authenticity.

üìö Studies (Cummings & Davies, 1994) highlight the profound impact of parental interactions on a child‚Äôs emotional and behavioral fabric. It‚Äôs an unspoken curriculum, weaving foundational lessons on relationships, respect, and emotional navigation.

üå± Whether we‚Äôre co-parenting or steering the ship alone, an introspective gaze into our actions and interactions can unveil opportunities to nurture emotionally intelligent, resilient children.

üí≠ Reflective moment: What‚Äôs one thing you hope your child learns from observing your relationships? Share your thoughts and aspirations in the comments.

instagram,"In this particular region of Ethiopia, conflict is common. Ethnic conflict destabilizes the peace, and religious groups often find themselves at odds. That was what pastor Eliso*, coordinator of the local church, wanted to find a solution for. He partnered with Open Doors and thanks to your support, the funds were provided to dig a new well on the grounds of the church compound. 
 
This addressed two issues: First, clean water isn't easy to come by for this community. This new water pump is solar powered and provides clean water to approximately 1000 households today. Second, it became a place where people with differences could come and congregate. Both Muslims and Christians use the well, and where there has previously been hostility Eliso sees friendship. One visitor to the compound said ""There is no pressure on us when we come to fetch water. We are not asked for any payment. What we have is respect and love now. We even enjoy coffee together in their compound.""
 
Praise God for the peacemakers in Ethiopia!

instagram,"Do you like when books reference songs/movies/shows?
‚Ä¢
I‚Äôve come to the realisation that I actually really love when authors include little hints and references to songs or movies or shows, either directly or indirectly, in their books! I‚Äôve only read a couple books by @lynnpainterbooks so far (Better Than the Movies and Betting On You), but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed she does often in her books and I find it so fun (I have a whole list for both of the books tracking all the references üòÇüôå)

Keep reading below for more of my thoughts on Betting On You (releasing November 28th)! Thank you so much to @simonteen / @simonschusterca for the ARC üíñü©µ

If people love Wes then they‚Äôre most likely going to love Charlie because they give off much of the same energy (although no one compares to Wes ü•πü©µ) They both have that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never admit it but I‚Äôd drop anything for her in a heartbeat‚Äù energy and the low-key sweet and caring nature hidden beneath a front of ill-hidden indifference ü•∞

I found Bailey and her hard-and-fast rule following nature to be so relatable at times‚Äîeven more so because she was also an introvert by nature but a book influencer on Instagram ü•πüëè And I loved how her sass and stubbornness slotted in perfectly with Charlie‚Äôs personality (mischievous and dedicated to getting under her skin) for the best banter üòåüòÇ

Mostly, this book was both funny and sweet and a little bit achy because what‚Äôs life without conflict and family issues and what‚Äôs love without a *bit (a *heaping) of denial and a moment of truth in the midst of the most intensely involved fake dating üò©

Also this book was like a treasure hunt of Taylor Swift references and I had so much fun trying to pick up which tidbits where references to her songs üòÇ PLUS it was even better because both Baliey and Charlie admitted to being swifties üòåüíñ (if you were wondering, this book gives of the most All Too Well (the 10 minute version) vibes üò©üëè)

Williams‚Äô charges stem from a shooting at Tiger Express, 375 Sea Island Parkway, Lady‚Äôs Island, SC that left a 50-year-old man suffering from a non-life-threatening gunshot wound.

On October 5, 2023, at approximately 4:15 p.m., Sheriff‚Äôs deputies were dispatched to the Tiger Express for a gunshot victim.  When they arrived, they found the man suffering from a gunshot wound to his thigh. 

Deputies learned that a conflict between the victim and Williams began while both were driving on Sea Island Parkway and one cut the other off in traffic.

Both vehicles pulled into the Tiger Express gas station where a verbal argument ensued.  The argument then escalated to Williams shooting the victim.

Deputies quickly identified Williams as the person responsible for the shooting.  He was located on Dulamo Road on Saint Helena Island shortly after 5:00 p.m. where he was detained.  As the investigation progressed, Williams was arrested and charged.

Williams is incarcerated at the Beaufort County Detention Center.",,21,"{'like_count': 20, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 1520}",Beaufort Co Sheriff‚Äôs Office,,2023-10-06 16:13:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/274990255_493805438859530_2034335853288955887_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=zJlHkheVKHYAX8MRDab&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDq2chG7Mm3T6rz08enSGZq28OYrvPo3TMw6uFAGY7uWA&oe=655AE15A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyEEsiBMlx-/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/386331611_859642829026522_3552531333719764919_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Pjih5f8dNd8AX_L9LIr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDiQxSWY5INlPPqB3ca816ncX3BbLzAjpaW-zTQv5c28g&oe=65406E0C

instagram,"Matters pertaining to education transformation and gun violence were among the areas discussed during a courtesy call between Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley and non-resident Apostolic Nuncio of the Holy See, The Most Reverend Santiago de Wit Guzm√°n.

During the meeting at Government Headquarters recently, Prime Minister Mottley informed The Most Reverend de Wit Guzm√°n, who is also Archbishop of Gabala, and his team, about Government‚Äôs proposed education transformation.

She stressed that all students must have equal opportunities to utilise their talents under a more balanced system.

‚ÄúThe last major reform in education in this country was premised on the 1940s English legislation, which said ‚Ä¶ ‚Äòlet us focus on the top 30 to 40 per cent but let us make sure that the next 60 to 70 per cent are manageable‚Äô, which was the colonial approach. ¬†

‚ÄúRegrettably, we have not broken the chains and the mould of that, so that we see, hear, and create opportunities for each and every child.¬† We have started, but we‚Äôre not where we want to be. Therefore, we need to make a greater resolve in order to ensure that each child can have the best possible future according to their talents,‚Äù Ms. Mottley stated.

She also expressed her deep concern about gun violence and abuse across the region, pointing out that it was necessary to find ways to encourage people to solve conflict, adding ‚Äúit has to be a whole of nation approach, whole-of-region approach, and a whole-of-world approach to tackling this issue‚Äù.

Meanwhile, the non-resident Apostolic Nuncio proffered the view that valuing the lives of individuals and strengthening the family unit could be used as tools to address violence.

‚ÄúI think families are very important and strengthening this institution should be a real goal‚Ä¶. Love, trust, confidence, and understanding that we can rely on one another and trust each other and the fact that we can build something together is very, very powerful. We can also further educate the younger generation about the importance of the family unit,‚Äù he said. The two officials also discussed the ongoing crisis in Haiti.

The Most Reverend de Wit Guzm√°n is based in Trinidad.

Welcome to Issue 138 of The Continent

Images of the Chagos Islands, which are illegally occupied by Britain, are rare. Images of Chagos from the perspective of Chagossians themselves are even rarer. They were brutally evicted from their land in 1973, and have been denied the right to return ever since. That‚Äôs what makes our cover image, a painting of Chagos by the Chagossian artist Modeste Alexis, all the more special. His mother Charlesia Alexis, was a tireless campaigner for the right of Chagossians to return home. That struggle is reaching its culmination, with Britain ‚Äì after being embarrassed in international courts ‚Äì currently negotiating the terms of a handover with Mauritius. But the proposed terms of this deal have divided the tight-knit, long-suffering Chagossian community.

instagram,"Africa's growth projection is either on an upward to downward trend, depending on who you ask and when.

However, throughout the year, the idea of Africa experiencing an economic downward spiral, albiet marginally, has been consistent. Be it the World Bank or the IMF, the projection on Africa's economic figures has been on the declining side.

According to the World Bank's September Africa Pulse report, economic activity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is predicted to have further slowed from 3.6 percent in 2022 to 2.5 percent in 2023, which is a downward revision of 0.6 percentage points from the prediction in the report's April 2023 edition.

The report notes that 28 of the 48 nations in Sub-Saharan Africa have had their growth projections for 2023 revised downward. Notably, the growth prediction for Sudan has been lowered downward by 12.5 percentage points due to the harm done to the nation's industrial foundation, as well as its educational and medical infrastructure, by the armed conflict that began there in April 2023.

With that said, the projected trend begs the question of what factors are responsible for the World Bank‚Äôs assessment. Some of the factors that have contributed to the downward trend include monetary and fiscal policy tightness in response to high inflation and fiscal unsustainability, high risk of debt distress, structural constraints such as energy and transportation bottlenecks, and rising conflict and violence manifested in a series of events such as coup d‚Äô√©tats, protests, and heightened social unrest across Sub-Saharan African countries

Recent research on global growth phases suggests that Sub-Saharan Africa consistently has lower rates of poverty that are sensitive to economic expansion than other areas.

This lower elasticity appears to be caused by a weaker relationship between GDP and household consumption growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, which suggests that African countries need to experience higher growth per capita to match improvements in average living standards experienced by households in other regions.",,16,"{'like_count': 16, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-06 13:07:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyDvejqsGmS/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386274851_1060169725325357_7711320566528636461_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=IcrX8CqfykYAX8zft0o&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAcp_EU7v532RecmAKKaUszbxaa5YhN98owTfSbekGbKQ&oe=65283D83

Designing for the future requires a complete understanding of the histories and systems, both scientific and political, that have led to where we find ourselves today. Otherwise, we risk simply adding conflict to issues like displacement, job insecurity and urban heat, among others.

instagram,"*ùóßùó™* If I‚Äôm being completely honest with myself, the only thing that‚Äôs kept me alive since high school is the fact that I‚Äôm scared of what would happen to my soul in the afterlife if I killed myself.

I don‚Äôt talk a lot about my mental health struggles, but sometimes I get a nudge to share from the deepest depths of my heart because my Inner Muse compels me to.

Today I want to share how my depression caused me to fail freshman year, lose out on one of my favorite jobs in early adulthood, and recently has shifted my work-life dramatically. 

Let‚Äôs start at the beginning.

In high school, the first waves of depression arose around 14 as I found myself floating between the cliques, not sure where I belonged or why I felt so different.

I was struggling with inner conflict that came from hiding my sexual identity.

I didn‚Äôt have any deep friendships, I was the black sheep of my family, and my neurodivergence made it hard to sit still and focus. I was failing multiple classes, and at one point I literally gave up. 

It was a perfect storm for a teenager to come to the conclusion that I‚Äôd probably be better off dead.

No one would really miss me, or so I thought.

I even got as far as making a plan to end it all with a full bottle of Adderall but a family friend actually ended up killing himself before I got the chance to off myself.

I saw how deeply his death affected me and the people around me.

It was enough for me to reconsider taking my own life and I somehow found the strength to push through high school- this was when I learned how to shape-shift and push my feelings down. 

It worked for a time until I eventually graduated and found some relief by learning to be more authentic.

I thought that would be the end of my depression, but I was not so fortunate.

Fast forward to 2016-17, I was working at a high school as an educational assistant for the Hawaii Department of Education.

To keep a long story short, I was having severe health issues that left me overwhelmed, exhausted, and glued to my bed- even when I knew I had to go out, ‚Äúbe an adult,‚Äù to take care of myself.

instagram,"Florian, Colombia ~ Part I
The story of a country, its conflict, and a new chapter. 

The U.S. State Department‚Äôs current travel advisory for Colombia is at level 3. ‚ÄúReconsider travel due to¬†crime¬†and¬†terrorism. Exercise increased caution due to¬†civil unrest¬†and¬†kidnapping‚Äù. The Colombian conflict began in the mid 1940‚Äôs during the period known as La Violencia. Control of the land has undoubtedly been the primary factor for a war that is now considered the longest ongoing armed conflict in Latin America. The fighting primarily took place in the countryside, isolating entire communities and making access to many places impossible. But things have been slowly shifting since the mid 2000‚Äôs, giving way to a new era of exploration in one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. At the forefront of this movement is a small group of climbers that have dedicated the past decade to advancing the country‚Äôs standard of sport climbing in a place known as The Land of Open Windows. 

The town of Florian boasts a stunning view of a steep mountain rock face where a cascading waterfall drops hundreds of meters to the valley below from a cave called Las Ventanas de Tisquizoque. This ancient cave is one of four established climbing areas in Florian with the highest concentration of hard routes ranging up to 5.13+. The high-quality limestone mixed with the steepness of the routes and the three-dimensional feel of the movements make the climbing a truly joyful experience. Filled with stalactites, the river carving through the mountain, and the Andean jungle view from inside the cave makes the entire setting feel surreal. Not to mention the perceived remoteness that makes one feel like being on an expedition to some far-off corner of the world.

‚Äú‚ÄùNever make a deal with shadows at night, especially ones that know your name.‚Äù

Washington D. C., 1925:¬†Clara Johnson can talk to spirits‚Äîa gift that saved her during her darkest moments, now a curse that‚Äôs left her indebted to the cunning spirit world. So when a powerful spirit offers her an opportunity to gain her freedom, Clara seizes the chance, no questions asked. The task: steal a magical ring from the wealthiest woman in the District.

Clara can‚Äôt pull off this daring heist alone. She‚Äôll need the help of an unlikely team, from a handsome jazz musician able to hypnotize with a melody to an aging actor who can change his face, to pull off the impossible. But as they race along DC‚Äôs legendary Black Broadway, conflict in the spirit world begins to leak into the human one‚Äîan insidious mystery is unfolding, one that could cost Clara her life and change the fate of an entire city.

The Monsters We Defy is a timely and dazzling historical fantasy that weaves together African American folk magic, history, and romance.‚Äù",,10,"{'like_count': 10, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 17238}",Erika,,2023-10-06 14:24:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/279786356_509578697319193_8824490435746245941_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=rmXmgMWCV78AX_9BzpS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAUinqk2sBRE8QBHDUgOj7KdWKUTdSan-p7g3vx6Fa1Uw&oe=655A3C47,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyD4PIsL2d9/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386913710_287636537560803_3788144817563990708_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=W0ay-TdrJtwAX90thI4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCOAM5uH_JE4cC1M6ciofXkEkZyY0ZtKH5OisJfYEdOBA&oe=6527279F

instagram,"We are shining a spotlight on Divorce Coach: Christina Watts. She is a graduate of the High Conflict Divorce Coach Certification Program.

When we created the High Conflict Divorce Coach Certification Program, it was Tina Swithin's goal to download over a decade of knowledge and experience to those following in her footsteps. When we hear feedback from clients of our graduates, we know these divorce coaches are making a difference in the world and in the lives of their clients.

From their website, ""My life's mission is to meet people where they are, and then support them to reach their fullest potential. To better serve my calling to help others, I chose to become a healthcare professional as my career path.‚Äù

instagram,"When we die, our souls will be led to a 'False Light / Reincarnation Trap'. So we won't reach further planes / realms to escape this prison realm. When your soul crosses over into the astral-plane they will try to deceive you with their holographic technology, an artificial mechanism that is hijacked by archons (demons). They act like your deceased relatives / loved ones, so called 'spirit guides' or as your relgious god to seduce you with an immense love of energy to enter their Tunnel / False Light / Moon Harvesting Unit.

It all depends on your beliefsystems, they can trick you in many ways by disguising themself as someone else so they can deceive you in the astral plane. They also trick your soul for a reincarnation on earth by acting like you still need to heal some karma. Many innocent / uninformed souls fall for this trap and are stuck in a cycle of reincarnation. If you fall for the false light trap than your memory will be fully erased when you get reincarnated back on this controlled plane / realm into a new body.
Even the names of the days of the week are related to planets and so called 'Roman Gods'/ demonic entities for a reason. Think about it, we live in a scripted world with a main language full of spells. Every MOONday we work to get/stay out of debt (debts= sin / death) and than we look forward to a WEAK-END (weekend). In the weekend we have SATURN-day (Saturday, 6th day of a week) and SUN(day), saturn stands for the limitations such as time, conflict and death. A system designed to keep us trapped in our lowest self.

There is a lot of false information out there on the perception of the moon like 'underground bases / aliens' just to keep you stuck in the rabbit hole with an endless loop of information where truths get mixed with false information. So stay in tune with yourself and learn to trust your own intuiton.

Keep working on yourself on all levels but don't take too much pressure on yourself. Take it easy and keep ya head up, much love!

Over het conflict in Soedan, dat in april losbarstte, wordt met geen woord gerept.

Dat de ene crisis meer aandacht krijgt dan de andere, is niet nieuw. Maar dat ‚Äòs werelds ‚Äì volgens de VN ‚Äì meest ‚Äòergste, complexe en gruwelijkste‚Äô humanitaire crisis op dit moment wordt doodgezwegen, doet toch enkele wenkbrauwen fronsen.

Al meer dan 400.000 vluchtelingen zijn de grens met buurland Tsjaad overgestoken. Samen met Artsen Zonder Grenzen biedt Handicap International hulp aan de getroffen bevolking. Het team kinesitherapeuten biedt er 7 dagen op 7 revalidatiehulp in een ziekenhuis dat uit zijn voegen barst. De landingsbaan van Adr√© wordt door het logistieke team opgelapt zodat hulpgoederen en hulpverleners sneller ter plaatse kunnen komen.

Qu'une crise re√ßoive plus d'attention qu'une autre, ce n'est pas nouveau. Mais que la crise humanitaire ¬´ la plus grave, la plus complexe et la plus horrible du monde ¬ª, selon les Nations unies, soit actuellement pass√©e sous silence... √áa nous indigne.

Plus de 400 000 r√©fugi√©s ont d√©j√† franchi la fronti√®re avec le Tchad voisin. En collaboration avec M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, Handicap International apporte son aide aux populations touch√©es. Notre √©quipe de kin√©sith√©rapeutes sur place fournit des soins de r√©adaptation sept jours sur sept dans un h√¥pital compl√®tement d√©bord√©. La piste d'atterrissage d'Adr√© est remise en √©tat par notre √©quipe logistique pour que les secours et l‚Äôaide humanitaire puissent arriver plus rapidement sur place.

- The Colony (Audrey Magee)‚Ä¶ read this for a quietly thoughtful meditation on nostalgia, the value of preserve the past, and cultural colonialism. At first I thought this was just an elegantly written novel, but as Magee unpacks the characters it turns into a really rich example of how to ‚Äúshow‚Äù your thesis, as the motives of the one dimensional Frenchman make clear why he‚Äôs an advocate for the past, and simultaneously the initially sympathetic characters at the start of the novel turn into a metaphor for hundreds of years of Irish-English conflict.

- Upgrade (Blake Crouch)‚Ä¶ read this if you want a high-octane techno-thriller that strikes a tone similar to what Michael Crichton would have taken if he were writing about biohacking.

instagram,"""I am very proud of the Merck Foundation ""Educating Linda Program"", launched 'Educating Linda' in 2019 to help young girls who are unprivileged but brilliant to continue their education. The spirit of the program is to provide an opportunity for such girls to pursue their dreams and reach their potential through access to education. It has been seen that many girls drop out of school due to a lack of necessities such as fees and uniforms. 

The Merck Foundation strongly believes that education is one of the most critical areas of women's empowerment. It is also an area that represents some of the distinct examples of discrimination women suffer. As evident in UNICEF‚Äôs declaration that in Africa, among children not attending school there are twice as many girls as boys, and among illiterate adults there are twice as many women as men. Girls‚Äô education is not a luxury.

Studies show that, in areas where there is high poverty and decades of conflict, girls face enormous challenges that limit their ability to get the education they deserve.

When Girls are educated, their countries become more powerful, stronger & prosperous. There is a need for more support as there are many brilliant girls who are struggling financially and socially to meet their educational needs.

Merck Foundation started ‚ÄúEducating Linda‚Äù, a pan-African program that is tailored for each country to contribute to the future of young African girls who are brilliant but underprivileged. The spirit of the project is to provide an opportunity for such girls to pursue their dreams and reach their potential through access to education.

Merck Foundation Educating Linda program has supported the education of 1000‚Äôs of the high performing girls from various countries like Burundi, CAR, DRC, Ghana, The Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, and Zambia by providing scholarships and grants that can cover school fees, school uniforms and other essentials including notebooks, pens, and mathematical instruments, so they can continue their education.""

instagram,"Disclaimer, not for the faint of heart: 
My ex of 7yrs was ex Marines/SBS/Private Security (aka merc) & the one question everyone would always ask him was ""what was it like to take a life?"", as a trained and licensed to kill professional most of the time he just answered, ""it didnt feel real because these days you are shooting at a little black dot in the distance"". Unless it was a covert op and they then had to go and clear it up afterwards or dig a mass grave,  a lot of the time it wasnt close up war fare so he said didnt really feel real (dont get me wrong once he left he then had to deal the reality of what he had been ordered to do, hence this incredible, intelligent, funny amazing  young man is no longer with us and took his own life. Bear with me, there's a reason to this story.  So the last close up war we had was the Falklands War, 256 British soldiers were killed during that conflict, and since then 264 veterans have committed suicide. Because it was close up war fare and fighting and the soldiers were seeing their mates being blown up, body parts flying, the trauma this caused and PTSD left these poor veterans unable to live with themselves....one of the times I saw my ex lose it I woke up to see him holding a machete with blood dripping off it and shouting something that I am not going to put on here and I was terrified he had hurt  himself and then the pain hit and I realised he had slashed me with the machete whilst I was asleep, he was moritified and couldnt believe he could do something like, after all the terrible things he had to do and see, cutting me with a blade left him traumatised.  The point of this story is how have we got to a society where people are capable of sticking a knife in someone that can actually kill a person, this is on a whole other level, in America people talk about gun crime and of course its horrific, but again its at a distance, push of a button, pull of a trigger, a drive by and gone, but knife crime, how did we get here? How have we got to a society that people are capable of stabbing people to death? We cannot ignore this any longer. We must unite & fight!

instagram,"Thank you to #PASenate Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness Chair, Senator Doug Mastriano, for hosting a ceremony to remember and recognize the heroic sacrifices made by U.S. military men and women during Operation Enduring Freedom. 
Operation Enduring Freedom was the U.S. led military response to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.

Oct. 7, 2001, less than one month after the attacks of 9/11, Operation Enduring Freedom signaled the start of the Global War on Terror. 

The conflict would last 13 years, during which the Pennsylvania National Guard mobilized and deployed over 4,200 airmen and 4,470 soldiers. 10 PA National Guard members were killed during this time. 

Together, we recognized the anniversary of the operation, its significance, and its effect on so many Pennsylvania veteran‚Äôs lives and their families.

instagram,"A military academy in Syria was targeted in an attack, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 100 individuals. This attack occurred shortly after Syria's defense minister had departed from a graduation ceremony at the academy.

Notably, the attack was one of the most deadly incidents involving a Syrian army facility and marked an unprecedented use of weaponized drones in a nation that has endured 12 years of civil conflict.

instagram,"You know what I haven't hashtagged in a while??? #teamworkmakesthedreamwork .... and I should probably add #divideandconquer ... and people I am so blown away by this team and consider myself the luckiest girl ever to have all of them ... yesterday as I was flying off to spend 10 days buying in Round Top, one of our most beloved projects was finally coming to an end (and our sweet clients can finally get us out of their house and enjoy it üòÇ) the final styling and photoshoot was happening at one of our EDH projects (that's El Dorado Hills for our non local friends) and getting the BTS texts from them was the highlight of my day.  So lemme tell you a little about what is in the works around here... 

Like I said, I'll be in Texas buying up all the vintage treasures, The Shop team is back at home preparing for our holiday collection launch üå≤üéÅ on October 28th (save the date!!). We close the Shop for two weeks and transform her into a magical holiday wonderland and you cannot imagine the work that goes into this launch (we had to hire some extra temp helpers to process all the inventory).

Ashlee, Jada and Amber will be heading off to High Point, NC for a buying trip of their own in a few days (BTW...I really wish the powers that be would stop scheduling HPMKT and Round Top at the same time!  Too many of us do both and the scheduling conflict is a real PIA üôÑ), and the design team is all head down as we race to the end of the year and try to have everything wrapped up for a well deserved holiday break. 

This morning me and the hubs have to drive about an hour away to pick up all of our packing supplies for the trip and then we head to Round Top and my cup will be full again!  Speaking of filling my cup ... Last night we scootered down South Congress Street and had the most amazing dinner and cocktails ü•É and I went home relaxed and maybe a little tipsy (and lemme tell you ...tipsy Leyla is a good time üòÇü•Ç) #RoundTopOrBust

instagram,"Facilitators Sought for MCC‚Äôs Workforce Excellence Series 

MOHAVE COUNTY ‚Äì Mohave Community College‚Äôs Workforce Excellence Series is helping businesses and individuals polish skills that promote success in their dealings with customers and community members. The growing popularity of the program now yields another opportunity for involvement, as course facilitators are currently being sought to help propel Mohave County‚Äôs workforce to the next level of service and success. 

Instructors are needed for courses including Manager and Supervisor, Leadership, Communication, Conflict Management and Resolution, Team Performance and Customer Service. Many of these classes focus on workforce fundamentals, such as setting direction for employees, understanding customers and how to manage arising or ongoing conflicts at work. 

As the MCC series is partnering with ARIZONA@WORK to offer tuition coverage for unemployed and underemployed residents of the region, spots are filling up fast. Instructors, working a paid, part-time position at 19.5 hours a week, are now needed for day, evening and weekend classes. 

While many institutions require employees to fit into a rigid schedule, MCC takes a more realistic approach. Lori Gunnette, Associate Dean, Career Training, Professional Development and Community Education, knows that most people have full schedules throughout the day. 

That‚Äôs why the College makes it a point to work with prospective facilitators and their schedules. Vacations, seasonal preferences and more are all taken into consideration during the planning process. 

‚ÄúIf you have a high school diploma or GED, and professional business and industry experience or training in the Workforce Excellence topic areas, we want you to teach for us,‚Äù said Gunnette. ‚ÄúWe are looking for individuals who are passionate about elevating Mohave County's workforce by sharing their professional expertise and industry knowledge.‚Äù

instagram,"In 2017, I discovered the Resonating Relationship Guide, a beautiful tool created by Discover Healing, which I eagerly shared with my cherished clients. This guide delves into the profound essence of your core love beliefs, explores the lingering traumas from past relationships, and gently guides you through understanding how past experiences may have shaped your reactions and responses in your current love connections.

Fast forward to 2022, and my journey took me to explore the fascinating realms of light scores and shared energies, the unseen threads that weave through our relationships. Inspired by this newfound knowledge, I introduced an Emergency 24-hour session designed specifically for couples facing seemingly insurmountable challenges. The results were nothing short of miraculous, as numerous couples shared heartfelt testimonials about how their partners transformed overnight, leaving them awestruck by the rapidity of their healing and reconciliation.

instagram,"This is a sweet contemporary/historical fantasy mash-up. After her personal and professional life falls apart, Helene escapes to Alaska to start fresh. There she runs into a man who shouldn‚Äôt exist; her imaginary friend, her ideal man who she‚Äôs been writing vignettes about since childhood. While Sebastian initially brushes her off, when they‚Äôre snowed in, he shares the truth; he and Helene are connected to the greatest love story of all time, spanning decades. As the truth sinks in, Helene must decide what she‚Äôs willing to risk for a chance at the type of love she‚Äôs always dreamed of. This book took my a while to get into; the first 50 or so pages really dragged; I think it‚Äôs because there was a lot of telling; all their characters and their surroundings were described in a minute detail, in a way that distracted me from getting into the overall story. Once the tale started to get going, however, I really enjoyed it. The split point of view and flashbacks were really effective, and got you invested in the true breadth of their love story. Helene was really relatable as a main character, I‚Äôve definitely had some of the same worries and insecurities that she dealt with at this stage of life. The final conflict felt a little unbelievable, but I liked the open ended, hopefulness of the ending. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve loved you again and again, across lifetimes. Our story defies reason and science and everything we‚Äôre taught to know about the world, but it is possible. And I think, perhaps, you know it too.‚Äù #virshreads2023 #virshreads #currentlyreading #bookstagrams #bookstagram #bookstagrammers #bookstagrammer #octoberreads #booklover #girlswhoread #book #bookish #supportyourlocallibrary #bookrecommendations #booksbooksandmorebooks #thehundredlovesofjuliet",,2,"{'like_count': 2, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 497}",Michelle V,,2023-10-06 01:12:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11374195_874785705946519_1158240265_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=D2fswTJYKHcAX9Wfwjx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBmY3Y9A3Qvhc0RS4Zypt6ywUwhyHcWvBMxwAX9MyVxgw&oe=655AC100,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyCdndONbRw/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386573102_1315450012432621_7118385252828753276_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=_c_IHau8QtYAX9ZVhwy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC4ulve3SHyFlOpe3WZT5skX12ghX29jM2C670VCbZ75w&oe=65599F66

I pray you won‚Äôt be living helplessly frustrated in marriage. Amen

I pray you will have a considerate spouse who will seek to resolve conflict and settle rather than wrestle .Amen

I pray that your marriage will make you light and peaceful.Amen

Thankful for the women who held forth in prayers for our struggling Wifestars and blessing our intimate lives. 

God is doing something in our midst and I am tired of running, I await to see it all.

I felt the need to extend this opportunity for a limited time. Send me a DM if you would like to join these women. I would send you details. All the best üí°

instagram,"Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @aljazeeraenglish Fifty years ago today, a war erupted in the Middle East that changed not just the region, but the world. It‚Äôs a war of many names, depending on who you ask: the October War, the Yom Kippur War, the Ramadan War, or the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The war‚Äôs victor is just as disputed. It began with a two-pronged attack against Israel by Egypt and Syria.‚Å†
Egypt attacked from the south, to take back the Sinai Peninsula, and Syria from the north, to take back the Golan Heights.‚Å†
.‚Å†
Israel had captured both six years prior in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, alongside occupying what remained of historic Palestine.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The recently formed state was riding high on that victory: it never anticipated an attack like this, especially not during Yom Kippur, an auspicious day for Jews. Meanwhile, the politics of the Cold War played in the background.‚Å†
.‚Å†
The Soviets supplied the Arab countries with weapons and the United States backed Israel. The two sides were on the brink of military conflict for the first time since the so-called Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.‚Å†

instagram,"On 6 October 1175, under the Treaty of Windsor, concluded on this date, the High King of Ireland Ruaidr√≠ mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, anglicised as Rory O‚ÄôConnor, recognises King Henry II of the Angevin Empire as his overlord and agrees to collect tribute for him from all parts of Ireland. 

Henry agrees that O‚ÄôConnor can be king of the areas not conquered by the Normans. 
But O‚ÄôConnor cannot control the territories of which he is nominally king, and Henry and his barons annex further land without consulting him.

Ruaidr√≠ signed the Treaty of Windsor with King Henry II of England. Whether he was unable or unwilling to, Henry did not or could not control the Norman barons, who continued conquering Irish territory, while Ruadhr√≠ could not control the lesser Irish kings. 

This led to further conflict which would continue for centuries. Ruadhr√≠ abdicated in 1183, but returned to rule briefly twice after that. Ruadhr√≠ died in the year 1198. He would be the last Gaelic king of Ireland, except for perhaps Brian Ua N√©ill (died 1260).

Brian Ua N√©ill and Edward Bruce both claimed the title of High King of Ireland with opposition in later years but their claims were considered illegitimate.

Overall, the agreement left O'Connor with a kingdom consisting of Ireland outside the provincial kingdom of Leinster (as it was then), Dublin and a territory from Waterford Dungarvan, as long as he paid tribute to Henry II, and owed fealty to him. All of Ireland was also subject to the new religious provisions of the papal bull Laudabiliter and the Synod of Cashel (1172).

O'Connor was obliged to pay one treated cow hide for every ten cattle. The other ""kings and people"" of Ireland were to enjoy their lands and liberties so long as they remained faithful to the kings of England, and were obliged to pay their tribute in hides through O'Connor.

The witnesses were Richard of Ilchester, Bishop of Winchester; Geoffrey, Bishop of Ely; Laurence O'Toole, Archbishop of Dublin; William, Earl of Essex; Justiciar Richard de Luci; Geoffrey de Purtico, Reginald de Courtenea (Courtenay) and three of Henry's court chaplains.",,1,"{'like_count': 1, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 145}",Historical Tours England,,2023-10-06 09:42:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/126844087_427147561997254_1535942718993808627_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=WS-oxuVL9KkAX_rocZQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDhe1ZeVxd4MByHFWKngYzR7m3i2rG_7WxG4afAUQmICw&oe=655A1E73,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyDX-gzKh-l/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/384129644_992664835155569_2251220559580675560_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EnHGEkvtV74AX-ZKrrn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA5oVfU354Hzp6og1avRoek9k8lPPoN-uHdMcStp1vsEg&oe=65343F38

instagram,"In your relationship, are you ok with asking for what you want? 

We‚Äôre not talking big things here like a new car or holiday, we‚Äôre talking about the small, everyday choices we all make. 

Asking for a specific meal for tea or asking to watch a programme that interests you that maybe your partner isn‚Äôt particularly interested in. 

These things sound small, but if you struggle to ask for these and always go along with what someone else wants, how will you ever be able to make the bigger choices and get what you want.

When we are not getting what we want, we are effectively getting what we don‚Äôt want. And how does that start to feel if it happens everyday?

Now this isn‚Äôt to say that we should all become totally unreasonable and start to demand that everything goes our way (that‚Äôs a whole other topic!) This is about compromise and team work with each other, where both of you feel seen and heard and get to enjoy the things you want more often. 

Work on overcoming your resistance to asking directly for what you want. Making a direct request for what you want allows your partner to get to know you better and know what to do if they want to treat or surprise you. This is beautiful for building a strong connection between the two of you.

What is ONE thing that you want that you could start asking for in your relationship?

instagram,"Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @talkdiplomacy Liberalism is a prominent theory in international relations that places a strong emphasis on individual and human rights, democracy, and international cooperation. It believes that the protection of human rights should be a fundamental goal in global affairs and that democratic governments tend to be more peaceful. Liberals advocate for international institutions, such as the United Nations, to facilitate diplomacy and problem-solving among states. Economic interdependence is another key concept in liberal theory, where trade and economic cooperation are seen as drivers for peace and stability. Liberals also emphasize the idea of soft power, the ability to influence others through attraction and persuasion rather than force. International law and norms play a vital role in regulating state behavior, and liberals believe that adherence to these principles can foster trust and reduce conflicts. Multilateralism is a core tenet of liberalism, with the belief that states should work together to address global challenges. Moreover, liberals recognize the importance of non-state actors, such as international organizations and non-governmental organizations, in shaping international relations. Liberal theory offers a positive outlook on the possibility of international cooperation and peaceful change, in contrast to other theories like realism, which have a more pessimistic view of international relations.

Liberalism in international relations is evident in the United Nations(UN), emphasizing diplomacy, human rights, and global cooperation. The UN's commitment to peaceful conflict resolution, adherence to international law, and protection of individual rights reflects liberal ideals in shaping the global stage for collaboration and peace. #liberalism #multilateralism #liberalideals #unitednations #talkdiplomacy #upsc #css #upscmotivation #upscaspirants #csstricks #collaboration #peace #globalaffairs #democraticgovernment #diplomacy #humanrights #cooperation #economicinterdependence #geopolitics #internationalrelationsstudent #internationalrelationstheory #peacefulchange #nonstateactors #liberaltheory #wars",,0,"{'like_count': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 312}",ClaudiaNelmsRJ,,2023-10-06 08:43:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/339541219_241175734975995_277266168015279906_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=BuWV9uHTSKgAX9FtMEC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAOvpl71G1ayI0ucffnerorSHsst9JKzgsNY4_YRDqlyA&oe=6559DE05,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyDRQNfMdJK/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386358013_1400337864254328_3139012223415729752_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=p7ASUCIqdOwAX_vVCAo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCjUEUW-LafaEjftO16IRbX74c_reFRjcpUuQumIN_Z_g&oe=654013A4

instagram,"Meet the black bear....literally! 

What should you do in such a situation? 

‚úÖ Leave the area.
‚úÖBack away slowly: stay calm and don‚Äôt run.
‚úÖMake yourself look large; if you‚Äôre in a group, band together and raise your arms.
‚úÖTry to scare the bear by waving, yelling, banging pots, blowing air horns or making other loud noises.
‚úÖIf a bear follows you, put your pack down to distract it while you retreat.

  On the remote chance of black bear attack:

- ‚ùå Do not play dead. Playing dead may deter grizzly bears, but will not work with black bears.
-‚ùå Do not climb up a tree. Black bears are adept climbers and you will only trap yourself. Fight back. You can improve your chances of escape by launching a strong counter-attack.
-Fend off the bear any way you can.

Bear spray is not a substitute for other precautions. Always do what you can to avoid a bear encounter.

Nuisance bears are usually created by humans. Careless humans teach bears that people are easy sources of food. Poorly managed open-pit dumps, for example, are notorious training grounds for problem bears. And at home, garbage bins, dirty barbeque grills and pet food left outdoors are common bear attractants.

Changing human behaviour is the most effective way to reduce conflict relating to human-bear encounters. Be #BearWise

The technology can be used in hard-hit areas of conflict where access is difficult, providing usable images within hours rather than days.

This can support the hunt for survivors in times of crisis.
