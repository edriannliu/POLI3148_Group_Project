Some words speak straight to the heart, without the need for flashy rhetoric. Jimin‚Äôs language does just that. We offer you his genuine warmth and honesty in his own authentic voice, in words that are quintessentially Jimin.
‚ÄúTo get to where we are now, our team has faced considerable struggles, occasionally losing our way and experiencing conflict, but always supporting each other. The joy, sorrow, pain, delight, and love we‚Äôve felt along the way‚Äîwe‚Äôve been candid about it all. I think these emotions struck a chord with people. So, in the end, it‚Äôs not really about language, but the heart that bridges the gap.‚Äù

instagram,"Il dolore diventa ogni giorno pi√π grande e le vittime innocenti dell‚Äôospedale di Gaza suscitano il mio pi√π profondo sdegno e devono scandalizzare le coscienze di tutti quelli che hanno il potere di decidere; non solo me e noi spettatori sconvolti e attoniti da tutto questo orrore.
Il mio pensiero va ai familiari delle vittime.
E mi unisco con tutto il cuore e con tutta la forza possibile al segretario generale dell‚ÄôOnu Antonio Guterres che ha chiesto un immediato cessate il fuoco nella regione.
Ha perfettamente ragione quando afferma che gli ospedali e il personale medico sono protetti dal diritto internazionale.
Cos√¨ come ha ragione l‚ÄôUnione Europea che ha ricordato e sottolineato che il limite sono le regole del diritto internazionale.
Tutti devono rispettare le regole del diritto internazionale e del diritto umanitario.
Non smetter√≤ di dirlo e non smetter√≤ di dire basta alla violenza!

instagram,"The pain of conflict becomes greater every day, and the innocent victims of the Gaza hospital attack have aroused the deepest outrage and must shock the consciences of all those who have the power to take and make decisions that can end this suffering. I am not alone in being a shocked and astonished onlooker at all of this horror.
However, my thoughts now are with the families of the innocent victims.
And I wholeheartedly join to depth of my being, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who has called for an immediate ceasefire in the region.
He is categorically correct that hospitals, patients and medical personnel are protected by international law.
As is the European Union correct when it reminded and stressed to the world that the the rules of international law set the limit and must be respected.
No one and nothing is exempt from abiding by the rules of international law and humanitarian law.
I will never stop saying this and I will never stop saying no more violence!

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

EDUCATE: @jewishvoiceforpeace or @democracynow are some places to learn about what is happening. (Please list other resources people may find useful below in the comments.)

instagram,"A senior official at the US State Department issued his resignation on Wednesday evening, citing the Biden administration's approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

""Let me be clear: Hamas' attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities,"" Josh Paul said in a letter, which was posted on X by Brian Finucane, a senior adviser at Crisis Group.

""But I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response, and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people - and is not in the long term American interest.

Paul worked for more than 10 ears in the State Department's Political-Military Affairs bureau, which is in charge of approving arms transfers to other countries.

Biden has been clear in stating that he will support
Israel unequivocally as it takes action against
Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, which on 7 October launched a surprise attack on Israel.

The war has so far killed more than 3,000 Palestinians, including around 1,000 children and 1,000 women, while also killing more than 1,400 Israelis.

MEE reported last week that the White House's phrasing of any calls for a ceasefire were ""repugnant"", sending a chilling message to progressive lawmakers and anti-war activists.

The Biden administration is currently drafting a major foreign aid bill that would include $10b for Israel. In addition to the aid package, the US has also deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern Mediterranean and has readied 2,000 American troops to be deployed in order to support Israel, as the country readies for a ground invasion of Gaza.

""I cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse, Paul said further in his letter.",,23879,"{'like_count': 23585, 'comment_count': 294, 'num_users': 779489}",Ahmed Eldin | ÿßŸîÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ¥Ÿáÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ,,2023-10-18 23:21:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/385875133_3637252009930162_319884512059397872_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=amaMK5nlvyMAX9W8qB7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB7Hp0ElAjB8egKBV9Qqdxc1keX8wXiZkWPqsINse7F9A&oe=655A9CB0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyjvTXCIKVg/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/393921626_18394135894008933_4657402237746734529_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=DYxSBO2bkxkAX-732m5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDSyG0Lug1dIrYbNJyEXVOD9CCUDpm3dV27rRdbfHEVUw&oe=655AEF83

instagram,"President Joe Biden cautioned the Israeli government to avoid being 'consumed' by 'rage' in his remarks from Tel Aviv on October 18.

Biden traveled to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid the growing Israel-Gaza conflict. During his remarks, Biden referenced 9/11 and admitted that the United States was enraged after the terrorist attack and 'made mistakes' while seeking justice. 

'But I caution this while you feel that rage: Don't be consumed by it,' Biden said. 'After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes ... I know the choices are never clear or easy for leadership. There's always cost. But it requires being deliberate. It requires asking very hard questions. It requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives.'

Biden didn't specify what mistakes, but many have assumed he was alluding to the U.S.'s invasion of Iraq after 9/11, which he supported as a senator at the time, but has since said was a mistake. The Iraq War destabilized the region for years and led to an enormous loss of civilian life, estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.

Critics argued that Biden's warning came off as somewhat hollow, given his administration‚Äôs substantial military aid to Israel. His remarks glossed over the stark power disparity between Israel and Palestine and failed to sufficiently address the humanitarian crisis unfolding in real time, they said.

In his address, Biden went on to urge the Israeli war cabinet to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza, predicated on inspections to ensure the aid bypasses Hamas. He stressed, 'The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people.' Following this appeal, Israel agreed to allow the entry of aid into Gaza.

However, detractors pointed out that these stringent conditions on aid might inadvertently perpetuate the cycle of violence and hamper efforts to achieve a sustainable cease-fire and lasting peace.

On Wednesday, American and Israeli intelligence said early evidence showed that the deadly explosion was caused by an errant rocket fired by Palestinian fighters.

instagram,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always been supporting the Palestinians in their struggle to realise their rights. Bangladesh stands by Palestine,‚Äù she told representatives of OIC countries in Dhaka on Oct 18.

On October 7, a Hamas attack inside Israel sparked a violent Tel Aviv counterattack that has resulted in nearly 3,500 Palestinian deaths and thousands of injuries. On the other hand, the conflict has claimed the lives of more than 1,300 Israeli citizens.

At least 300 people were killed in the allegedly Israeli-led bombing of a Gaza hospital on Tuesday, many of them children. Despite Tel Aviv and its ally the US denying it, the Arab world condemned the attack and blamed Israel for it. Bangladesh condemned the attack on the Ahli Arabi Hospital and charged Israel with committing a ""grave crime against humanity"" and a ""criminal act."" Dhaka said in a forceful statement that those responsible for this criminal act must be held accountable for their deeds.

Dhaka said this ruthless attack is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian laws and accords ‚Äúwhich constitutes a grave crime against humanity‚Äù. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Hasina has ordered sending medicine to Palestine on an urgent basis.

instagram,"The Iranian-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terror organization was responsible for an explosion at the Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, due to a misfired rocket intended to kill Israeli civilians, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) @idf . 

The explosion, which reportedly killed hundreds of people, sparked outrage, with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas pulling out of a meeting Wednesday with U.S. President Joe Biden over the issue. Biden has backed Israel‚Äôs war of self-defense against the Hamas terror group, which rules Gaza and which killed over 1,400 Israelis in a massive terror attack on October 7.

Hamas and critics of Israel rushed to blame an Israeli airstrike. News wires, like the Getty photo service, published unproven claims Israel had ‚Äúattack[ed]‚Äù the hospital, citing the ‚ÄúGaza Health Ministry,‚Äù which is run by Hamas. But Israel, noting that it does not target hospitals, said an errant Palestinian rocket was a likely cause, later confirming that analysis.

instagram,"Rp: @sirianajanine: ‚ÄúBut why is a preschool teacher posting about Palestine? That‚Äôs so political.‚Äù

Kindly see yourself out, because you‚Äôre most likely a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù person who doesn‚Äôt say this when I speak out against every other injustice that affects marginalized and oppressed peoples. 

The story of Palestine is the first injustice and struggle for liberation that I ever learned about. üáµüá∏ It‚Äôs what brought me to my work. 

In the past, Palestinians and their allies have been silenced and threatened for speaking out about the colonization of their land. 

In fact, until recently, people and governments would falsely call you antisemitic if you even said the name ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù, and not ‚ÄúPalestinian territories.‚Äù This was intentionally meant to suppress solidarity and the truth about Palestine, while it also meant that antisemitism (a very present and dangerous form of bigotry against Jewish people) was misrepresented as criticizing Israel‚Äôs violent establishment and ethnic cleansing. 

And with so much false information and deflection that continues to frame Palestine as a ‚Äútwo-sided, complicated, religious conflict‚Äù, I had to speak out and share my lifetime of knowledge and research on the Palestinian struggle for justice. 

Please amplify Palestinian voices. Please listen to Jewish voices when they stand in solidarity and tell Israel to stop colonizing Palestine in the name of their religion. Israeli genocide does not represent Judaism. Justice for one is justice for all. 

I invite you to continue reading Palestinian stories and speaking with your children about Palestine, the way you do with all forms of racism and oppression. 

You are welcome to ask me questions to help you unlearn the anti-Palestinian and orientalist rhetoric we‚Äôve all been taught. You are NOT welcome to attack me by falsely claiming my solidarity with Palestinians is antisemitic. 

There is hope. There is light. Freedom begins with knowledge.

instagram,"‚ÄúThe massacre brought our health system to its knees.‚Äù

A doctor at Gaza‚Äôs al-Ahli Arab hospital has described the ‚Äúsurreal‚Äù and ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù scenes he witnessed in the aftermath of an Israeli air strike that killed at least 471 Palestinians there last night.

‚ÄúThe brutality and the nature of the injuries we saw were something we had never witnessed in any attack on Gaza before,‚Äù Mohammed Gniem told Middle East Eye, after an Israeli bomb ripped through the hospital, leaving the bodies of the dead and wounded in its wake.

The massacre marks the single greatest loss of life in the ongoing conflict, which has seen at least 3,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza and the West Bank, and 1,400 people killed in Israel. Israeli siege and air strikes on Gaza have continued since 7 October, following a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel.

Thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the courtyards of al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, assuming that they were in a safe place. Many of those are now dead or seriously wounded.

One eyewitness, who did not wish to be named, told MEE that Israel ‚Äúthreatened to bomb the hospital during the first days of the attack, but we never thought they would actually do it‚Äù.

Gniem said that the massacre had shattered Gaza‚Äôs health system.

‚ÄúBefore the massacre, our hospital was already on the brink. Rooms were filled with those healing from previous massacres, and every corridor was filled with displaced people who sought a safe place to stay,‚Äù the doctor said.

‚ÄúTry picturing a hospital already at capacity,‚Äù Gniem said. ‚ÄúThen add an influx of 500 of the injured and deceased,‚Äù he told MEE.

The doctor said that he had seen the bellies of children ripped open, ‚Äútheir remains were coming out of their bodies. All these injuries came while the staff were exhausted and the hospital was full.

‚ÄúIn a facility already stretched thin, our staff had to make do, treating those injured wherever space permitted, on the bare ground, with whatever scant supplies we had left,‚Äù Gniem said.

instagram,"My older son called me yesterday. Recent events in Israel and Gaza have had him thinking about the 9/11 attacks. He asked me what they were like for me, a then 20 year old who had given birth to him just 11 days earlier.

I tried to explain the confusion and fear. The way that I couldn't fully wrap my head around what I was seeing on my television screen. I remember feeling upside down sudden. I remember holding my baby and wondering what world I had brought him into.

But what I remember even more clearly was what the US did in response. I remember sitting in the break room at work as Bush talked about a ""war on terror"" and I remember thinking clearly - having pretty good  knowledge from my studies of how US global colonialist interventions and support of oppressive regimes had been a major driver of the cycles of violence that the terror attacks were a part of. 

I remember wanting to get home to hug my baby so desperately. I just stood there at work, no sick time left after maternity leave, absorbing the knowledge that my baby, and millions of other babies would be the ones to pay for our deliberately uninformed rage, our violence, our greed, our bigotry.
And so yesterday, my baby, now two years older than I was on the day of those attacks, my baby who like so many of his generation has only known these wars that are still happening, has only known the Middle East as a place of conflict, and who is still one of the lucky ones because he was born in the place doing the killing and not the place where a million were killed - he asked me what it was like then, and I couldn't think of a way to explain that every day is still that day and worse. Because we didn't stop it. We didn't stop the nightmare that was right before us, and now we can't wake up.

instagram,"A HISTORY OF SILENCE: A Melbourne man says he‚Äôs learned from past mistakes as he opts to stay out of the social media discourse surrounding the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

In previous flare ups between Israel and Palestine, Naarm boy Wesley Talbot was quick to show his support for Palestine but that lead to conflict between his old Camberwell schoolmates who didn‚Äôt see it the way he did.

‚ÄúTheir parents called my parents, it was messy but that was a while ago and my old friends were happy to ‚Äòeducate‚Äô me and move on,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSo despite there being, you know, clear violations of international law and abhorrent criminal acts committed upon‚Ä¶ actually, I‚Äôm going to stop myself there. I didn‚Äôt even share anything about the referendum, to tell you the truth, I think I‚Äôm actually going to become one of those guys that doesn‚Äôt post anything ‚Äì like ever,‚Äù

‚ÄúLike, I still see my school friends heaps and while, like, they didn‚Äôt exactly forge the same path through Melbourne Uni that I did, like a lot of them are now dentists and doctors, some are lawyers and engineers. But, like, I did Arts with a major in criticism and Australian literature so, yeah, my university experience was a bit different,‚Äù

‚ÄúSo now, like, for example, I have a friend that grew up in a council flat in Fitzroy so there‚Äôs that and like I don‚Äôt exactly get back to Brighton that much now that I live in Northcote so yeah, I forget that sometimes a lot of my school friends are pretty conservative and like, I think a few of them are from like ‚Äòtheir-dad-is-Jewish‚Äô type setups or something. So yeah, like my school mates are pretty pro-Israel and my uni friends are like full on going to pro-Palestine protests,‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm just going to sit this one out, I‚Äôm not even on the fence here. I‚Äôm in a different postcode.‚Äù

instagram,"Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) should impose an oil embargo and other sanctions on Israel and expel all Israeli ambassadors, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Wednesday.

An urgent meeting of the OIC is taking place in the Saudi city of Jeddah to discuss the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict, after a blast at a Gaza hospital late on Tuesday killed large numbers of Palestinians.
""The foreign minister calls for an immediate and complete embargo on Israel by Islamic countries, including oil sanctions, in addition to expelling Israeli ambassadors if relations with the Zionist regime have been established,"" the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.

Amirabdollahian also called for the formation of a team of Islamic lawyers to document potential war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza.
Prior to the blast at the Gaza hospital on Tuesday, health authorities in Gaza said at least 3,000 people had died during Israel's 11-day bombardment that began after a Hamas Oct. 7 rampage on southern Israeli communities in which 1,300 people were killed and around 200 were taken into Gaza as hostages.

instagram,"SCORRI PER LEGGERE üëâ

Israele üáÆüá± e Hamas si puntano il dito su chi √® il responsabile del missile che ieri ha colpito un ospedale üè• nella striscia di Gaza üáµüá∏ uccidendo almeno 500 persone tra cui donne e bambini.

Avere un parere oggettivo e senza vizi di parte dai media occidentali al momento √® molto difficile‚Ä¶ Ecco la nostra analisi che include tutte le accuse, ad entrambi gli stati, con un occhio distaccato e imparziale ‚û°Ô∏è

Secondo noi, l‚Äôunico modo per cui si possa giungere ad una verit√† √® che sulla questione indaghi un ente esterno neutrale e senza interessi economici in nessuno dei due schieramenti.
Non america. Non Israele. Non Hamas o gli stati alleati. 

üö® DISCLAIMER: 
Ci teniamo a sottolineare che il nostro punto di vista sulla questione √® neutrale e che il nostro unico ""appoggio"" va alle popolazioni civili (sia palestinesi che israeliane) che vengono tragicamente coinvolte nel conflitto.

Molti ci accusano persino di non poter portare determinati contenuti, senza sapere che parliamo di temi sociali e attualit√† da ormai 5 anni.
Quello che rispondiamo a questi utenti √® che tutti i nostri post vengono pubblicati con tesi e prove volte a raccogliere tutti i giudizi oggettivi dell'accaduto senza cercare di dare per forza di cose ragione all'uno o all'altro schieramento (come fanno la maggior parte dei mass-media da cui vi informate).

I contenuti delle prossime slide vi daranno prova della seriet√† e dedizione con cui trattiamo anche determinate tematiche.
Non vogliamo raccogliere il consenso di nessuno: quando abbiamo riportato dell'attacco di Hamas contro Israele abbiamo subito gli insulti dei PRO-palestinesi... Quando ieri sera abbiamo riportato dell'attacco all'ospedale abbiamo invece ricevuto le critiche dei filo-israeliani.

Smettetela di trattare questo conflitto come fosse una partita di calcio e guardate in faccia la realt√†. Migliaia di innocenti stanno morendo.

President Biden announced today the U.S. will provide $100 million in humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.

The administration says this funding will help provide clean water, food, medical care, and other critical aid to Palestinian civilians who have been displaced by the conflict.

Israel adds that this will be the only type of aid allowed in and will continue as long as the supplies do not reach Hamas.

The two leaders agreed that the aid will not enter through Israel‚Äôs border with Gaza but instead through the Rafah Crossing which connects to Egypt.

As of this post, Egypt has not agreed to open that crossing. We will continue to monitor development.

The White House said in a statement that ‚Äúcivilians are not to blame and should not suffer for Hamas‚Äôs horrific terrorism. Civilian lives must be protected and assistance must urgently reach those in need.‚Äù

instagram,"German club Mainz 05 suspended Dutch forward Anwar El Ghazi (@elghazi21) for a social media post about the conflict that the Bundesliga club felt was ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù.

‚ÄúMainz 05 respects that there are different perspectives on the complex Middle East conflict that has been going on for decades,‚Äù the club said in a statement posted on X on Tuesday.

‚ÄúEl Ghazi took a position on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East that was deemed unacceptable and the club clearly distances itself from the content of the post as it does not reflect the values ‚Äã‚Äãof our club.‚Äù

Dutch international El Ghazi made the comments in a ‚Äúsince-deleted‚Äù post on social media on Sunday night, Mainz said.

The club did not provide further details about what El Ghazi had written in the deleted post but said, ‚ÄúPrior to making this decision, the club and the player had engaged in an in-depth discussion.‚Äù

It did not indicate how long the suspension could last.

instagram,"On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel's bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli Baptist hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.
Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world's most densely populated places.
Israel has held it under siege for 17 ears. In the last 11 davs Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.
On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent
Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.
""As scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.""

instagram,"Hundreds of San Francisco high school students and students from across the country walked out of classes Wednesday to protest ongoing violence in Gaza and call for an immediate ceasefire.

The walkout led by Arab Youth Organizing came after an explosion at a hospital where the Hamas-run Health Ministry says at least 500 people were killed, though the event was conceived of earlier by a San Francisco high school student whose family is from Gaza, organizers said. More than 3,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, including over 1,100 children, according to organizers.

A couple of hundred students marched along Francisco Street before turning onto Van Ness Avenue and walking toward Bay Street from Galileo High School. At the head of the line, a student held the Palestinian flag. Other students chanted, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""

The White House says current intelligence shows that Israel was ‚Äúnot responsible‚Äù for the explosion at a Gaza hospital, but information is still being collected. Hamas blames Israel.

Students are demanding an end to U.S. aid to Israel, arguing the funding enables Israel's military strikes on Gaza. The U.S. provides about $3.8 billion a year in aid to Israel.

Organizers held a news conference outside San Francisco City Hall at 10 a.m. ahead of the planned walkout. Speakers included local officials, religious leaders, labor leaders and community organizers.

instagram,"Iran has called on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to take a strong stance against Israel following a deadly strike on a Gaza hospital that claimed over 500 lives. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian urged OIC members to impose an oil embargo and other sanctions on Israel and expel Israeli ambassadors. He also proposed creating a team of Islamic lawyers to document potential war crimes by Israel. This call for action came after an Israeli air raid on the hospital, which triggered widespread pro-Palestinian protests in various countries. The toll from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been significant, with thousands of deaths and injuries on both sides.

instagram,"A rare Roman-era mosaic is uncovered during the excavation of an old building in Syria .

RASTAN, Syria ‚Äîin 2022 Syria uncovered a large intact mosaic that dates back to the Roman era, describing it Wednesday as the most important archaeological discovery since the country's conflict began 11 years ago.

Journalists were shown the mosaic in the central town of Rastan near Homs, Syria's third largest city.

The mosaic, at 120 square meters (around 1,300 square feet), was found in an old building that Syria's General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums had been excavating.

Lebanese and Syrian businessmen from the neighboring country's Nabu Museum bought the property that dates back to the 4th century and donated it to the Syrian state.

Each panel was filled with square-shaped, small colorful stones measuring about half an inch on each side.

Dr. Humam Saad, the associate director of excavation and archaeological research at the directorate, said among the scenes the mosaic shows is a rare portrayal of Ancient Amazon warriors in Roman mythology.

""What is in front of us is a discovery that is rare on a global scale,"" Saad told The Associated Press, adding that the images are ""rich in details,"" and includes scenes from the Trojan War between the Greeks and Trojans.

In Ancient Greek and Roman mythology, demigod hero Hercules slayed Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, in one of his 12 labors.

instagram,"I shared this on my stories days ago and wanted to give it some more permanence on my timeline for two reasons:

1. I‚Äôve been seeing VERY little online discussions or at the VERY LEAST mentioning by Latinx accounts, Raza accounts Foo accounts and Cultura accounts all alike of what has been violently unraveling in Israel and Gaza. Especially you foos that are out here cashing in on using ‚Äúdecolonization‚Äù as an aspect or focus of your work within a system that co-opts, tokenizes yet also rewards you. I see you.

2. Many Latina/o/x have not reckoned with our own history of colonization and genocidal violence that has in many cases directly informed our very present state of modern existence‚Ä¶

YET the struggle and fight has also always been part of our history.

Comandante Tacho‚Äôs words are a resoundingly reflective echo of this very fact- From the First Exchange of Indigenous Peoples in Mexico nearly 10 year ago in 2014.

‚ÄúWhen we say these two words so well known by our peoples‚Äîthese words of death and destruction‚Äîour heart and our gaze goes to the PALESTINIAN people. We hear and read what they say about ‚Äúthe conflict in Gaza,‚Äù as if there were two equal forces confronting each other, and as if saying ‚Äúconflict‚Äù would hide the death and destruction such that death would not kill and destruction would not destroy.
But as the indigenous people that we are, we know that what is happening there is not a ‚Äúconflict‚Äù but a MASSACRE, that the government of Israel is carrying out a war of extermination upon the PALESTINIAN people. Everything else is just words to try to hide reality.
But we also know, as the indigenous people that we are, that the PALESTINIAN people will resist and will rise again, that they will once again begin to walk and that they will know then that, although we are far away on the map, the Zapatista peoples embrace them today as we have before, as we always do, with our collective heart.‚Äù

Demand an immediate Gaza cease fire. There are no two sides to genocide.

Als reactie heeft Isra√´l de toevoer van water, voedsel, elektriciteit en benzine aan de Gazastrook stopgezet. Ook worden gebouwen daar door Isra√´l gebombardeerd. In totaal vielen sinds 7 oktober meer dan 3300 doden aan Palestijnse zijde. Het is onduidelijk of ook de doden van het bombardement op het ziekenhuis in Gaza-Stad op 17 oktober zijn meegeteld.

‚úÖ Palestijnen in Gaza zijn het slachtoffer van de blokkade en krijgen geen medicatie, water en voedsel.
‚úÖ Internationale organisaties zeggen dat er schendingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht zijn.

‚ùå Sommigen willen wel dat er water en andere goederen terecht komen bij onschuldige mensen in Gaza, maar zijn het oneens met het woord ‚Äòvergeldingsacties‚Äô.
‚ùå Isra√´l heeft ook het recht op zelfverdediging, met inachtneming van het internationaal recht. 
‚ùå In een conflict als dit moet eerst onderzocht worden of dit een oorlogsmisdaad is.

US President Joe Biden has arrived in Israel in a desperate bid to prevent the war with Hamas from spiralling into a wider conflict after a devastating blast on a Gaza hospital killed 500 people. 

Biden was received by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he touched down at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv this morning amid warnings the war is 'spiralling out of control' following the deadly fireball explosion at the hospital.

instagram,"While we all would like conflicts to be minimized, avoided, or resolved by peaceful means, the reality is that sometimes some people are so maddened by their hunger for power, by their memories of grievance and the cravings for vengeance, or by the extreme ideologies that they essentially become Wicked, and that means that there is no talking sense with them.

In fact, trying to have a peaceful negotiation with such elements ends up essentially appeasing them, and appeasing people who are wicked only empowers them to do far worse things in the future.

So appeasement will not work with extremist elements, and the need for confrontational approaches to weed out such elements has to be acknowledged. This, in fact, is the purpose of Kshatriyas, the Bhagavad Gita says that when such approaches are required, the warrior class of people, the martial guardians of society, do not flinch from violence (18.43).

While confrontation is required for those who are power-hungry, violence can never bring lasting peace.

After the extremist elements have been purged, the non-confrontational approaches can also help us to come towards some level of peace, and this is where the Bhagwat Gita's wisdom offers humanity in general and seekers in particular resources for raising human consciousness.

The Gita informs that human nature usually falls into three categories-  or three modes- sattva, rajas, and tamas.

This philanthropic endeavor comes in the midst of ongoing controversy surrounding McDonald's worldwide due to its indirect provision of free meals to the Israeli occupation army.

It further highlighted the company's commitment to addressing the pressing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, emphasising its dedication to offering assistance to those affected by the protracted conflict in the region.

instagram,"""The WP supports Singapore‚Äôs long-held position that a two-state solution consistent with UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions is the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive resolution to the long-standing conflict between Israel and Palestine

In particular, UNSC Resolution 242 which is supported by Singapore, calls for the withdrawal of Israel from Palestinian territories occupied since the 1967 war in exchange for a lasting peace with its neighbours.

Worryingly, the continuing conflict in Israel and Palestine is likely to increase attacks against Jews and Muslims elsewhere, raising the prospect of radicalisation far beyond the Middle-East, making the world more unsafe and dangerous for all countries, particularly where multi-racial and multi-cultural communities live in peace and harmony. All Singaporeans should be aware and mindful of this possibility, and play an active part to prevent it from happening on our shores."" - @wpsgp",,4312,"{'like_count': 4206, 'comment_count': 106, 'num_users': 158176}",Wake Up Singapore üá∏üá¨,,2023-10-18 13:27:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/273185003_3108599552714221_4795526303611638633_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=S5CHlaKeHpkAX-LZNqY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBqM2Li39zS9kYdUrpyTWfKNA1nDtW97XwaG_hElXDJOQ&oe=655A0CEB,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyirTyORaIZ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393355175_861323995441707_8236874570117097216_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=eza50iN-ZXYAX9jMqrJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCtLts6HinUU84Osog68obBUqLYNn-1Zl3PaK09l6QEeQ&oe=65404C9B

Some words speak straight to the heart, without the need for flashy rhetoric. Jimin‚Äôs language does just that. We offer you his genuine warmth and honesty in his own authentic voice, in words that are quintessentially Jimin.
‚ÄúTo get to where we are now, our team has faced considerable struggles, occasionally losing our way and experiencing conflict, but always supporting each other. The joy, sorrow, pain, delight, and love we‚Äôve felt along the way‚Äîwe‚Äôve been candid about it all. I think these emotions struck a chord with people. So, in the end, it‚Äôs not really about language, but the heart that bridges the gap.‚Äù
Visit gqkorea.co.kr now to access the full interview and photoshoot with Jimin, whose very being embodies honest expression. And don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe festivities of ‚ÄúJimtober‚Äù are far from over.

instagram,"Attackers threw two Molotov cocktails at a synagogue and a Jewish community center in Berlin overnight, police said on Wednesday.

Following the attack, Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed that the government would fight antisemitism in Germany.

The attack comes as a conflict rages between Israel and the Islamist militant group Hamas, which Germany, the EU and several other countries classify as a terrorist organization.

Berlin police said they were probing the attack in the city's Mitte district. There were no reports of injuries or damage.

The attack occurred around 3:45 a.m. local time (0145 GMT).

""Two unidentified people came on foot and threw two burning bottles filled with liquid in the direction of the synagogue on Brunnenstrasse,"" police said in a statement.

""The bottles landed on the pavement and broke, extinguishing the fire.""

Berlin's Jewish Community called for solidarity with the targeted synagogue.

""85 years after Kristallnacht, synagogues in Germany's capital are set to burn again,"" said community chair Gideon Joffe, referring to mass looting and arson of Jewish businesses and institutions under Nazi Germany.

""The anti-Jewish violence on the streets of Berlin has thus taken on a new dimension.""

I cannot bring up the idea of ecosystems of mutual care and support and collective upliftment without mentioning that what is happening in Gaza right now is a genocide and as a global community we MUST pay attention, speak up, take action, and bear witness to the large scale suffering and humanitarian crisis that is unfolding before our eyes in real time.

Please call your representatives to call for an immediate ceasefire, to send humanitarian aid and assistance to Gaza and save as many lives as possible (resources linked in my stories), show up to protests, and continue to bear witness however much you want to look away.

instagram,"Sweet, sensitive and full of life that‚Äôs exactly how we‚Äôd describe Jem. This beautiful boy is a kind and gentle soul. He‚Äôs looking for friends not conflict and would much rather focus on the non-stressful things in life. Lovers like Jem need equally gentle adopters. Those willing to ease him in to new experiences and make life a series of positive outcomes. We love the gentle souls. They can be easy to train because they‚Äôre so willing to please and want nothing more than a kind word and a soft touch. 

Jem almost didn‚Äôt get to experience all the good  this world has to offer. He was euthanasia listed when he came down with an upper respiratory infection at our county shelter. Already shy and unassuming in the shelter environment. He didn‚Äôt stand out and then a super infectious illness risked his life. He needed time and that‚Äôs exactly what we could give him. Jem headed to our rescue ranch where he has quickly recovered into the wonderful boy we all know and love. 

Jem‚Äôs kindness has followed him into rescue life. He‚Äôs super duper submissive to every dog and human he‚Äôs met. He‚Äôs a total lover not a fighter. He‚Äôs completely cat friendly with no prey drive cause he just wants to be everyone‚Äôs best friend. He still has a puppy like personality and is a blank skate. Ranch staff are working on the basics of good dog manners and he‚Äôs picking everything up quickly. His beautiful blue eyes are soft and gentle and we‚Äôre pretty sure they‚Äôll pull you in and make you fall in love. We know we have. If you love the gentle souls who are beautiful both inside and out then Jem just might be the pup for you.

This aspect of her character adds a unique and compelling layer to the story. Her initial life of relative contentment takes a chilling turn when a mysterious man named Pascal intrudes, leaving a cryptic gift at her gallery.

The plot unfolds with a gripping mix of elements‚Äîmystery, suspense, and psychological drama.

Readers will find themselves empathizing with Wilf's desire for a normal life, making his character relatable and endearing.

One of the book's strengths lies in its exploration of fear and courage. Wilf's internal conflict regarding his fear of magic and the need to use it to save his friend Katryna is both a relatable and inspiring aspect of the story. It emphasizes the theme that true courage is not the absence of fear but the ability to confront it, making it a valuable lesson for young adult readers.

The narrative is well-paced, keeping readers engaged as Wilf races against time to unlock the secrets of his father's journal and find a cure for the Virus of Beauty. The book's title is intriguing and directly relates to the central conflict in the story, drawing readers in with its unique concept.

""The Virus of Beauty"" is a strong start to the Wilf Gilvary Series. It offers a rich blend of magic, mystery, and personal growth, making it an excellent choice for young adult readers who enjoy stories of courage and adventure. C. B. Lyall's writing is not only engaging but also thought-provoking, and it sets the stage for an exciting series that promises to explore even more complex themes in future installments.",,3794,"{'like_count': 3794, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 152372}",Booksforbadal,,2023-10-18 13:19:09,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/355696528_969414144304719_4917511745576569816_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=GJ5GY97FwtsAX9GFLOc&_nc_oc=AQnumser7v02LxBOFE-LtGZ_OAbH8JzBytshUxsSbXqDpGruzL8-Rkei0GZgvPmKTWU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAv6avYxReL1Qn6e0Pi8wXggi-mwh0KF_c1RqoCGqyOQw&oe=655A7484,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyiqUgfpTQW/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393138376_1032018291378137_2378596778786577488_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=2zFSQijA-FQAX8ieTgD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCf8pV7bhzR_h6rgupVWBiCQLRsf9AiozjBi4vReTQZqQ&oe=654BB291

instagram,"A summit between between Palestinian, US, Jordanian and Egyptian leaders, has been cancelled, just hours before Joe Biden was due to visit the region.‚Å†
‚Å†
The US president was set to meet them after his visit to Israel on Wednesday.‚Å†
‚Å†
The summit's cancellation is a blow to Mr Biden's diplomatic efforts over the Middle East crisis.‚Å†
‚Å†
Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi said: ""There is no use in talking now about anything except stopping the war.""‚Å†
‚Å†
Mr Biden will no longer visit Jordan, and instead only visit Israel, the White House said.‚Å†
‚Å†
A spokesperson said: ""After consulting with King Abdullah II of Jordan and in light of the days of mourning announced by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, President Biden will postpone his travel to Jordan and the planned meeting with these two leaders and President Sisi of Egypt.""‚Å†
‚Å†
In a statement, President Biden said: ""I am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted. Immediately upon hearing this news, I spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened.‚Å†
‚Å†
""The United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy.""‚Å†
‚Å†
The summit would have focused on getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza, while working towards calming tensions in the region.‚Å†
‚Å†
The cancellation of the summit comes after a deadly strike on a hospital in Gaza, which the Hamas-led government said has killed up to 500 people.""‚Å†

instagram,"A 6-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death and his mother was seriously injured in what police said was a hate crime linked to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East.

The Justice Department opened a federal hate crimes investigation into the alleged murder of the boy, who was identified as Wadea Al-Fayoume, and wounding of his mother, Hanaan Shahin, according to a statement.

Joseph Czuba, the family's landlord, allegedly stabbed the boy 26 times with a ""military-style knife"" and his mother more than a dozen in the incident at their home in the Chicago suburb of Plainfield, Illinois.

Wadea's uncle, Yousef Hannon, spoke to @ABCNews on Tuesday, saying the family was shocked over the alleged murder because Wadea was previously ""like a grandson"" to Czuba and there were no other signs he harbored any anti-Muslim views.

AOM

I remember very clearly when I was only seven that I wished for a superpower so I could free the people of occupied Kashmir. A dream to work for the UN was born. I later realised how powerless the UN was when it came to ending the genocides and wars especially in the Middle East. 

I realised how racism was so prevalent in the security council and the only voice that mattered was the voice of few. 

In 2003 when the UK invaded Iraq I was heartbroken. I spent days crying. And each time any other war happened, I would become distressed. 

Now with the onslaught on Gaza. I've felt nothing but deep sickness in the pit of my stomach. I'm not functioning well at all. The images on the media are harrowing and fill me with anxiety and feelings of hopelessness.

When events are as disturbing as this plays out on our screens, it can harm the mental well-being of thousands, especially those with pre-existing health issues, such as PTSD, Eating Disorders. 

As long as I live I am never going to forget how each and every single war made me feel. How it impacted my mental health.

I question so often what did people of Afghanistan did so wrong that they have been subject of indiscriminate bombing forever. 

Don't people of Kashmir have right to freedom.

Why Palestinians have suffered forever and why flag bearers of human rights cannot stop this ongoing genocide?

Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Libya. The list is endless.

Am I on a brink of relapse? Why am I remembering all the previous wars? Why eating has become so difficult and why I feel so guilty of eating and living in a country that is somehow responsible for the plight of the people of Kashmir and Palestine.

The toll on Gaza is immeasurable, and with each passing day, the pain and suffering intensify. We cannot stand idly by as our brothers and sisters in Palestine endure this harrowing crisis. Our moral duty is clear: to offer our heartfelt prayers and extend a compassionate hand in their time of desperate need.

Mr Safadi said the meeting would be held at a time when the parties could agree to end the 'war and the massacres against Palestinians', blaming Israel with its military campaign for pushing the region to 'the brink of the abyss.'

Mr Biden was expected to make a whirlwind trip to Israel where he would later head to Jordan and according to Jordanian officials meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

Jordan's King Abdullah would have hosted the four-way summit, which would have on its agenda the need to get humanitarian assistance to Gaza to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and tamp down the conflict with Israel.

King Abdullah has blamed Israel for a blast at a Gaza hospital that killed about 500 Palestinians last night, saying it was a 'shame on humanity' and called on Israel to immediately end its military campaign against Gaza.

Details: On Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike targeted the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the Gaza Strip. The strike resulted in more than 500 casualties, as confirmed by the Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra. Disturbing footage depicted the aftermath of the strike, with bodies scattered across the hospital grounds. 

More: This attack occurred during the 11th day of the ongoing conflict in the region. International condemnation of the Israeli bombing campaign in Gaza has been growing, with claims that it violates international law and may constitute a war crime. Palestinian group Hamas has described the targeting of the hospital as an act of ""genocide.""

instagram,"If we want resilient kids, we‚Äôve got to give them the opportunities to flex their resilience muscles and develop their resilience skills. Too often, we‚Äôre doing the opposite, always looking over their shoulders, never giving them the freedom to dabble, explore, mess up, find their path, connect with likeminded others, and see that the world isn‚Äôt a dangerous place.

While many adults lament kids retreating into video games, we think it offers one of the clearest examples of the problem. Video games are this generation‚Äôs sandlot. It‚Äôs a place free of adults, where kids can mess up, talk trash, lose, and bounce back‚Äîall without an adult hovering over them. Adults have forced kids into the video game box. It‚Äôs the one area where adults can‚Äôt get in the way.

It‚Äôs time to reverse course. Our kids desperately need it. We need to give kids the space to explore, mess up, and maybe even break a bone or two. Adults need to realize that the price of a broken wrist at age six is much less than the cost of a young adult who hasn‚Äôt learned the skills to manage their emotions or explore the world around them. Yet adults only see the broken wrist, not the much greater, albeit hidden, cost of safetyism.

Decades of ‚Äãresearch shows‚Äã that when we turn up the dial on threats, whether perceived or real, our brains listen. We‚Äôre more likely to avoid conflict instead of approach it, react instead of respond, and isolate instead of connect.

Without being aware of it, adults are training kids to have hypersensitive threat alarms, without the tools or resources to handle any sort of challenge. The consequences are dire. 

We wrote a full article going in depth on the research and what we can do about it the micromanaging of kids. Check it out: Link in bio.

Note: For clarities sakes, while the cited study is about playing in neighborhoods, other research shows there‚Äôs a decline in playing outside: be it in yards, parks, etc. A meta-analysis on kids independent play found 5 factors:
1. Parental restrictions (safety concerns)
2. Societal changes (organization of all, community)
3. Environment
4. Policy issues (kids not having a voice)

They(we) are mourning the beloved ones, they are hurt - as mentally as physically. They need your support as much as people in Gaza right now. 

I see comments ‚Äòreturn to your fucking homeland blondie‚Äô; ‚Äòyou literally occupying the land‚Äô..; I see my colleagues posting MEMES on the worst Saturday of our history with ‚Äòpeople living under occupation have a right to resist‚Äô when we were burying 1400 slaughtered victims of terror. You compare graphs of amount of death through the history. You argue if it beheaded babies are real or not - and then you go BACK TO YOUR LIFES. Work, family, errands - we are 9 million people, Arabs included - not knowing how to live, how to breathe, how to wake up or fall asleep, how to cry or stop crying for 12 days. 
Of course, I am just a privileged blonde complaining from my sofa only having panic attacks and chest pain while people are being bombed, I get it.
But I live it - while you HAVE to make an opinion and ‚Äòchoose a side‚Äô knowing probably 10% of information on the conflict and history.
You are advocating for human rights, for humanity in general; against collective punishment - yet what you are doing by spreading hate towards Israelis now is psychological terror and collective punishment itself - Hamas‚Äô seed was even more fruitful than they expected.

Please I am begging you for mercy, I am begging for ceasefire, for compassion; I am begging to be able to breath again and work again and live again but so far I see no future in the world hiding hatred behind humanity.

instagram,"It‚Äôs so shocking and heartbreaking to, over the last few weeks, see the devastation and cruelty inflicted upon innocent people within the conflict between Israel and Palestine; A conflict where the history and power imbalance cannot be ignored or removed from the context. 

It goes without saying that the violence perpetrated by Hamas in Israel is something that cannot be endorsed by anyone and is abhorrent - but the retaliative actions by the Israeli government are nothing short of an attempt at ethnic cleansing, and if the history of the conflict is acknowledged; has clearly been an objective of the Israeli government. 

Their actions have been condemned by the UN, and the international community in a way which UK & US media refuse to do in an impartial or fully analytical way. It‚Äôs a situation which is very challenging to dissect due to the nature of the backlash that any criticism of Israel faces - but it must be acknowledged that criticism of the Israeli government and anti-semitism is a false dichotomy that tries to silence any defence of the attempt to give a voice to the plight of Palestinian people. 

We support peace between Israel and Palestine, but right now we unequivocally stand with the innocent people in Palestine who have had their food, water, and energy supplies cut off, and have been indiscriminately attacked to the point of what is clearly an attempt at eradication of a people; and of course any innocent person who has experienced violence in any part of this conflict. 

Even the Israeli media are trying to hold their own government to account, and so should the rest of the world. 

There is a feeling of helplessness watching this, but vocalising outrage is a small part of trying to create awareness, where our national media fails to.

instagram,"What happened: UK PM Rishi Sunak announces 10 million pounds aid for Palestinians, calls them 'victims of Hamas‚Äô. In his address, Sunak strongly condemned Hamas' actions and referred to their attacks on Israel as a ""pogrom,"" a term denoting an organized massacre based on ethnicity or religion. He also claimed that Hamas was using innocent Palestinians as human shields. Talks are underway between UK officials and other countries, including Israel and Egypt, to open the Rafah crossing in Gaza for humanitarian aid. Importantly, the UK government clarified that none of the aid funding goes to Hamas and undergoes rigorous oversight.

Details: The death toll from the Israel-Hamas conflict has tragically surpassed 4,000 people, with Hamas' attacks on Israel resulting in approximately 1,300 civilian casualties, including children, and the loss of 291 Israeli soldiers' lives. Additionally, Hamas fighters have taken Israeli citizens as hostages.

More: In Gaza, the toll is equally devastating, with over 2,750 people, including more than 700 children, losing their lives. Nearly 10,000 individuals have been wounded, and an alarming 10,000 people remain missing, as reported by authorities. The Opposition Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, emphasized the severity of the humanitarian crisis and called for Israel's defense to align with international law while expressing unity in the UK's stance during this crisis.

instagram,"Are you having the same fight with your partner over and over again?

Here‚Äôs what research from The Gottman Institute shows us on conflict:

70% of relationship problems are not solvable üëÄ

üîÖ Solvable problems: these are situational and involve things like, cleaning, managing kids or in-laws, travel, etc. There isn't a deep or underlying meaning, and usually a solution.

üîÖ Perpetual problems: these are based on differences in your needs and personalities. These tend to be recurring among couples.

üîÖ Gridlocked perpetual problems: these may have been mishandled in the past because they are distressing. Many times, there are deeper issues underlying them that are not openly discussed.

If you‚Äôre stuck in a negative cycle of one of these types of problems, it can feel so painful and really hold you back from growing in your relationship. 

When I work with individuals or couples, I try to help them understand if any of their core needs are associated with the problems they are presenting with. It makes a big difference in how we address them and come up with ways to move forward.

The video shows a 21-year-old Israeli-French woman kidnapped from the Supernova Music Festival, where the brutal militants also killed some 260 revelers.

Israeli news has identified the hostage as Mia Shem from Shoham, Israel.

In the roughly minute-long clip shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, Shem is initially seen getting her arm, which appears to have a row of stitches on it, bandaged, before she directly addresses the camera.

'Everything is fine,' she says, in part. 'I ask that they bring me home as soon as possible.'""

instagram,"Something that can offer some peace + inner relief in times as heavy as right now is this... that there‚Äôs simply things we can‚Äôt accept and that accepting we can‚Äôt accept something is actually a huge part of acceptance. A way to create a safe container to meet our self again without resistance. To allow ourselves to be exactly what we are which helps us return to unity & Oneness within.‚Ä®‚Ä®So what is acceptance? To me it‚Äôs being seen. It‚Äôs holding space for something. Allowance. Allowing it to exist instead of denying it. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Now let‚Äôs go back to our paths, our life lessons, our thought-forms and our emotions... there‚Äôs simply moments on our journey and things that occur within the collective that are simply too heavy, too traumatic, and full of too much density for us to always understand. There‚Äôs things we could have never imagined happening that do. Ways people treat us especially when we were a child that we can‚Äôt make sense of. Wars. Loss. And I‚Äôve been seeing in clients and collectively right now in these powerful times of change that by forcing ourselves to try and be ok with something that really isn‚Äôt ok with us is a form of force. It‚Äôs conflict. It‚Äôs an inner war. It‚Äôs going against our truth. And then the fact that we‚Äôre trying to see something from a higher perspective, but we can‚Äôt, can cause even more lack of safety, making us feel like something further is wrong with us, more inner conflict, and a lack of feeling seen or supported which creates more dysregulation. 

So I just wanted to remind you that it‚Äôs more than ok to accept that you can‚Äôt accept something. Sometimes it‚Äôs actually the healthiest choice for yourself, the one full of the most love, when you‚Äôre up against something that‚Äôs just too big and overwhelming on the other side of you. So surrender to that. Just allow some things to be unacceptable if they truly feel that way. This will help to actually bring you into harmony vs. resistance. It will restore your peace & ease some of your fear. ‚Ä®‚Ä®If you‚Äôre interested in identifying your subconscious patterns, regulating your nervous system, clearing away outdated energetic patterns & reframing your life experiences, 1-on-1 sessions are open ‚ú®",,2546,"{'like_count': 2530, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 138283}",Kristen Csuhran,,2023-10-18 01:20:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/398313270_350030794264773_2048952609402788329_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=MSjVTWtxdKIAX-spKMj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCfweSHW7MoiIZ-VltuE7g1TRoxyLDXtUcZfgmwOcWdWA&oe=655B5E8B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyhYGfbsWoO/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391626280_18393814864019524_1541533174259361170_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=lkJM6qmbX-4AX_z641Q&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBEHaUsVB7gNUnor-oiB6b7QcX97bLw8Ovs_dAVVce35w&oe=655AB5BC

instagram,"SEEKING THE ULTIMATE TRUTH ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíö

Self-knowledge is actual knowledge‚Äîall other knowledge changes. What we learn in school differs based on the period of time. Our school knowledge is not based on what's good for us but rather on the best way to govern and control others.

That's why some communities send their children to two schools‚Äîone to learn about others, the other to learn about themselves. So, with all that we think we know, such as the name of the first president, sadly, we don't know who we are. We've spent years believing in the intellect and not the spirit. As a result, we stay childlike, superficially smart, and uninvolved instead of wise and evolved.

With self-knowledge, we become empowered with thoughts that transcend this world. We seek that ultimate truth. But to seek that truth, we must realize the conflict within ourselves.

That conflict is to either remain asleep or wake up. As the story goes, we can be like ""Iai,"" an ass that won't let go of the lies or falsehood. Undoubtedly, we've become stubborn in thinking that the path is one of assimilation with a dominant force, whereas it's one of assimilating with a life force. No one will empower you with self-knowledge, which leads us to the ""ultimate"" truth. Give yourself the gift of waking up to truly being free. -Dr. Robbin Alston

instagram,"Iran on Wednesday urged members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to take a strong stance against Israel following the deadly strike on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, claiming more than 500 lives.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian called for the imposition of an oil embargo and other sanctions on Israel and the expulsion of all Israeli ambassadors. He made these remarks during an emergency OIC meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which aimed to address the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

According to an official statement, the Iranian FM ""calls for an immediate and complete embargo on Israel by Islamic countries, including oil sanctions, in addition to expelling Israeli ambassadors if relations with the Zionist regime have been established‚Äù.

Amirabdollahian also proposed the creation of a team of Islamic lawyers to document potential war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza. It's important to note that Iran has no diplomatic relations with Israel.

The call for action came after a devastating Israeli air raid on a hospital in Gaza, resulting in a high casualty count, according to Palestinians. Gaza‚Äôs Health Ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, reported that hundreds of people lost their lives, and rescue efforts were still underway to recover bodies from the rubble.

The humanitarian crises in the Middle East right now is devastating & my heart breaks for the innocent mothers, children, fathers & families whose worlds are being destroyed by this conflict. I think what is most devastating is reading about how the current bout of violence is the latest bloody installment on a war that has been raging for decades. Can you even imagine how many lives have been lost since the beginning of this conflict?

instagram,"The escalating violence in Israel and Gaza has no clear end in sight and reverberates around the world, including on our campus. I have condemned the Hamas terrorist attacks that set these tragic events in motion. We mourn the loss of innocent lives across the region.
 
I am also responsible for ensuring the safety and security of our entire community while also safeguarding our ability to carry out our academic mission. 
 
This week‚Äôs campus demonstrations come at a time when many members of our community are fearful and experiencing tremendous pain. Peaceful protest ‚Äì and all that comes with it‚Äîis a feature of campus life. As a university, we support free expression, along with a commitment to the safety and security of our community and the values we share and work to advance. The deeply held and disparate views of the Israel-Palestinian conflict often put these sacred values in tension, and this crisis is testing and will test our community in many ways. 
 
Penn will not tolerate and will take immediate action against any incitement to violence or, of course, actual violence. We are monitoring upcoming events closely through Penn Public Safety and are exercising extreme vigilance to prevent violence on our campus. If there is an immediate threat to your physical safety, call our 24/7 PennComm Emergency Call Center: 215-573-3333 
 
We are all members of the Penn community, and we all deserve to be heard and respected. But hateful speech has no place at Penn. No place. I categorically condemn hateful speech that denigrates others as contrary to our values. In this tragic moment, we must respect the pain of our classmates and colleagues and recognize that our speech and actions have the power to both harm and heal our community. We must choose healing, resisting those who would divide us and instead respect and care for one another.
 
There are more difficult days ahead, with more casualties and loss to come in this war. Please be kind to yourselves, approach each other from a place of compassion and understanding, and seek support when you need it. The Penn community is here for you.

4,200 dead in 10 days.

The death toll in the latest and bloodiest episode in the Middle East conflict continues to rise.

The tally includes a large number of women and children, with many more bodies yet to be found from the rubble.

The ongoing battle sparked by the Hamas cross-border attack on Oct. 7 prompted a brutal response from a shaken Israeli nation.

The results are casualties on both sides and civilians caught in the crossfire.

The last blast that killed 500 in a Gaza hospital raises further the death toll, and the ending to this conflict is still nowhere in the horizon for now.

Reports estimate upwards of 500 dead at present.

Responsibility is being contested by all parties, with both sides pointing the finger at each other. 

One should be clear though that those responsible need to be held accountable to the full extent of international law regardless of who they are. 

This is also leading to even more increased international tensions as the Arab world reacts to the devastating scenes. Some reports also show people in the surrounding region taking to the street in protest and attempting to storm Israeli embassies. 

Realtime coverage of these events may also be distressing to people, especially as coverage in legacy outlets are rapidly changing over a short period of time.

Truth is often the first casualty of war and right now many of us obversering are getting fed intense propaganda from supporters of all sides in this conflict, with a lot of analysis of things that are impossible to discern instantly from online videos or images.

As the fighting intensifies and the horrors for civilian populations increase, the information war has become more calculated with deliberately crafted language and imagery aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the international community.

The legacy media, unless they can 100% verify, need to word their headlines carefully if they don't have boots on the ground or did not witness an incident firsthand.

It's also disconcerting to see multiple people I follow, who usually exhibit more discernment, sharing doctored or outdated videos and images not once, but consistently.

I can't say for certain if it's intentional or unintentional, but it's certainly concerning.",,2067,"{'like_count': 1473, 'comment_count': 594, 'num_users': 94213}",Rukshan Fernando,,2023-10-18 00:29:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/243550818_147386347601785_7030819563720572569_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4Z6n-jsFI-wAX9H88S7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAIOQxh4Q19C55WTgHh1P5vgUWHneiOtYUfA7AhHBheLg&oe=6559B52D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyhSSfMyf5b/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392740032_1108150823925732_3247698880206933549_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=-jEJK4QVi_kAX_1qzfI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAieLJFryw5qhiftjzRLHCzyx2XNAn0ZL02uoSzX_zCPg&oe=6559603A

instagram,"An Israeli air raid on the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza reportedly claimed the lives of more than 500 Palestinians ‚Äì including displaced individuals seeking shelter, hospital staff, and patients, both young and old, Al Jazeera reported. The news ‚Äì and graphic photographs and videos emerging from the site of the bombing ‚Äì was accompanied by calls for trigger warnings. But as one user on X pointed out, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre triggered by hearing people talk about it then imagine how the Palestinians are feeling as they live through it‚Ä¶ [They] don‚Äôt get trigger warnings seeing their innocent families and friends getting murdered‚Ä¶ [If] they don‚Äôt get a trigger warning, you don‚Äôt either.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
What started as a well-intentioned tool to avoid unintentionally triggering people‚Äôs trauma has now been relegated to instruments of virtue-signalling rooted in privilege. Many have criticised people on social media demanding trigger warnings on news and think-pieces focusing on the crisis in Gaza, pointing out how it speaks to their privilege. The argument of ‚Äòchoosing' ‚Äì while distanced from the conflict itself ‚Äì whether or not to engage with evidence of violence no longer seems to hold as strongly. If content depicting the first-hand distress of people in the eye of the violence causes second-hand distress -- it‚Äôs causing precisely the reaction it should. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Yes, the digital age necessitates a culture of consent ‚Äì but not to the extent that it allows people to overlook mass violence. Amid the persistent demand for trigger warnings even now, what‚Äôs been overlooked all along is researchers being heavily conflicted on the efficacy of using trigger warnings. Tap the link in bio to read @devruparakshit‚Äôs piece from the archives on why we‚Äôre insistent on holding on to trigger warnings despite research suggesting they‚Äôre counterproductive.

instagram,"The loss of children in Palestine during times of war is an indescribable tragedy that words fail to encompass. The heartache and devastation that families endure is beyond measure, shattering dreams and tearing at the very fabric of their existence.

In the midst of conflict, children in Palestine face unimaginable hardships. They are innocent souls caught in the crossfire, facing dangers that no child should ever have to encounter. Fear, violence, and uncertainty become their daily reality, robbing them of the carefree joys of childhood.

The loss of a child during war is a wound that never truly heals. It leaves families shattered and communities grieving, forever altered by the absence of these precious young lives. The pain is etched deeply in the hearts of parents, eternally mourning the loss of their beloved children.

Compassion and empathy are crucial when addressing the impact of child loss in Palestine. It is a profound sorrow that resonates across borders, transcending political divides. The loss of these young lives echoes not only within their families but also within the collective consciousness of humanity.
In the face of such immense tragedy, it is essential to extend support, understanding, and compassion to the affected families. Offering empathy to the grieving parents and communities creates a space where healing can slowly begin. Recognizing their pain and acknowledging the depth of their suffering is an act of compassion that can provide some semblance of comfort in the midst of profound grief.

Beyond offering condolences, it is crucial to work towards a peaceful resolution, one that protects the lives of children and fosters a future where they can flourish free from the horrors of war. By advocating for peace, we can strive to prevent further loss and ensure that every child in Palestine can grow up in a world where their potential is nurtured, dreams are realized, and their lives are valued above all else.

In the face of such unimaginable devastation, solidarity, compassion, and a commitment to peace are the pillars that can provide hope in the darkest of times.

This is the face of who is actually getting harmed in the current (and long long ongoing) Hamas- Israeli Conflict

Rahaf was ten

The coverage is confusing. And the fear for someone like me is getting it wrong in a response. There is a lot I have no idea about

Two sides. Politics coming into play. Entrenched and complicated. I have friends who identify across all levels of these conflicts. Difficult to understand. I have heard a lot of arguments about history. 

Of course history matters. 

But how much does it matter when these are the victims: Children who should be playing and being loved. I bet they knew little about the nuances. 

They should be being kept safe by INTERNATIONALLY protected agreements. You shouldn‚Äôt know who this child is because she should be quietly thriving in childhood. 

But she is dead

It doesn‚Äôt matter which group she came from. Every child has this same right. Your child, my child, every child.

An eye for an eye. Steeped in raw and deep history, religion, desperation. Generational loss, oppression. And yet it continues. It can be confusing to look in on. I even struggle with the terminology. I know there is so much I don‚Äôt know. 

But I do know this. These are people caught up. Innocent lives. Versions of you and me who have nowhere to turn. Who just want to live their lives. Do their jobs. Be with their families. 

The terrorist actions of Hammas are deplorable. But the Israeli response too is. There is dark and terrible happenings on both sides. And the innocent victims are aplenty. 

I have been sent footage of doctors just like me, showing that they are now unable to protect and treat. Hospitals and healthcare staff should always be safe haven. 

We must pressure our own governments to call for immediate ceasefire. To halt these atrocities. International law tells us we shouldn‚Äôt stand for any of this. Basic human rights tell us we shouldn‚Äôt stand for any of this. Bring a normal person tells us we shouldn‚Äôt stand for this.

As it turns out, poor communication is the number one cause of conflict. Conflict is a healthy part of relating to other people. But it can be tricky at work‚Äîespecially if you disagree with your boss.

Maybe your manager announces his next great idea, and you think it‚Äôs destined for failure. Or you may have received a performance review rating that you vehemently disagree with. Whatever the scenario, you never want to burst into your boss‚Äô office and scream at the top of your lungs, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely wrong!‚Äù Instead, consider whether you want to confront your boss or keep quiet. A key reason to openly disagree with your manager is when it benefits the overall organization. If you can show your boss that you have the company's best interests in mind, a difference of opinion can be a win-win for both of you.

instagram,"Look who's here to ""crash"" the party! 

Brian, a six-year-old male Indian rhino from Ohio's @columbuszoo, has made his public debut in the Asian Highlands. 

Currently, guests can spot him in the Indian rhino yard nearest to the takin habitat. Once he's fully acclimated to his new home, he will be paired with Hellary, the Zoo's 15-year-old female Indian rhino.

With only about 4,000 of these rhinos remaining in India and Nepal, Brian's arrival marks an exciting step forward in the Zoo's ongoing rhino conservation efforts.

‚ÄúHuman population growth within the Indian rhino‚Äôs home range has led to a decrease in habitat and increase in human-animal conflict,"" said Ryan Sears, our curator of large mammals. 

""Despite these challenges, the recovery of the population for this species has been a conservation success in recent years, due to the changes made in management practices and protective measures. We are excited to continue to tell this conservation story with Brian.

instagram,"International Law Supports Palestinian Right to Resistance:

In the face of ongoing global debate regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it is crucial to understand the legal context surrounding the Palestinian people's right to resist occupying forces. While organisations such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad are designated as proscribed groups in numerous Western nations, it is essential to recognize that many other factions choose to exercise their legal right to resist occupation. This legal right is well-established within the framework of international law.

Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory is a topic of significant concern, with its legitimacy disputed by many. According to the United Nations (UN) and the Geneva Conventions, people living under occupation have a recognized and legitimate right to resist. This right is grounded in numerous international resolutions that affirm the principles of national liberation and self-determination, even including armed struggle.

As stated in UN General Assembly resolutions, ""Dozens of resolutions by the UNGA support national liberation movements in their struggle for independence and self-determination, including armed struggle, as exemplified by Resolution 2105 of 1965.""

Furthermore, international humanitarian law explicitly acknowledges the right to engage in wars of national liberation as a protected and essential right for occupied populations, as outlined in Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949.

For a comprehensive understanding of the legal basis for the Palestinian right to resistance, you can refer to the following sources:

1. UN General Assembly Resolutions: law4palestine.org/do-palestinians-have-the-right-to-resist-and-what-are-the-limits-short-article/

2. International Humanitarian Law Documentation: treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%201125/volume-1125-i-17512-english.pdf

In light of these legal frameworks, it is evident that the Palestinian people possess a recognized right to resist occupation, supported by international law and United Nations resolutions. This right remains an essential aspect of their pursuit of self-determination and national liberation.",,1583,"{'like_count': 1574, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 85381}",Hamza Andreas Tzortzis,,2023-10-18 11:18:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/315725481_111206661807998_2899148560008240750_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=LwKLakVJCQYAX-NAgkQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBaD3_fn-3rkBNhoZVZiURUR2xxFIq4rMn6X83LX-n7WA&oe=655B9091,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyickRtsZ8E/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393187924_1169302597363068_8115158616865849379_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=akb9OnwI_IsAX_BDiUs&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBhfLqLDkUxjd-fEpBRzTN4vzSvJFBWJgSdVNsXRv3fNA&oe=654E20F1

Let me remind the peaceful people... that being peaceful is not passive. It is not about hiding, being silent, turning a blind eye, or denial, fear, or avoidance.¬†Peace is something we choose. It's a conscious choice.

It takes a great amount of work, effort, strength, and emotional intelligence to become a peaceful person, especially when raised in chaos, abuse, and/or violence.

Peaceful people do not avoid conflict. They diffuse conflict. Right now, we need to diffuse conflict. Some very powerful, corrupt, problematic beings are showing up in full force. On ALL sides - with various sinister agendas. So, ALL of the lightworkers, light warriors, and light bearers need to RISE UP NOW.

Please beam peace to the Middle East. Send healing and protection for the innocent people - on ALL sides. Project the best possible outcome onto them. Send the innocent people energy and strength. See the innocent people being free. Use your energy, healing, intention, attention - to help the innocent people. (Include as many countries as you like; it's not ""either-or""). Daily.¬†

Comments about which ""side/tribe/religion"" is good/bad will be deleted. Lightworkers do not fall for the trap of ""divide and conquer"" dictated by political leaders and mainstream media.

instagram,"HISTORY OF THE ROMAN-TARENTINE WARS
‚ûñ
Tarentum was a Greek city located in southern Italy which was founded in the 8th century BC by Spartan colonists, one of many similar cities founded across the Mediterranean. Over time it was able to grow into a prosperous and influential community, with Greeks and Greek culture becoming widespread in southern Italy, enough for the region to be called ""Magna Graecia"". Tarentum also developed a strong army, including a talented cavalry force, and with this was able to enforce its influence in the region, becoming a pre-eminent power.
---
Although Rome likely knew of Tarentum beforehand, their first serious diplomatic contacts appear to have come in the 290s BC after Rome's victory in the Third Samnite War, after which they founded several new colonies in Apulia and Lucania, much to the worry of Tarentum. Worse still was the fact that Rome was quickly growing her influence in Magna Graecia and overtaking Tarentine power. Matters reached a breaking point in 283 BC when the Tarentines, in a fit of panic, attacked a Roman fleet carrying soldiers to Thurii that came close to their city due to being blown off course by bad weather.
---
Rome was surprised by this move and tried to negotiate with Tarentum, but the Greeks instead mocked their ambassadors, leading to the Romans and Tarentum going to full war. The conflict proved very one sided as the overconfident Tarentines were defeated in battle, and by 281 BC were torn over negotiating for peace. The city seemed to get a much needed reprieve when the Greek king Pyrrhus of Epirus answered their call for aid and arrived in Italy with an army. The Tarentines fought alongside the Epirotes against Rome in the Pyrrhic War (280-275 BC), but despite their contribution Pyrrhus was eventually defeated. The Romans returned in 272 BC, and this time conquered Tarentum for good, defeating the last bastion of resistance to their rule in Magna Graecia.

Srinagar, Oct 18: Muttahida Majlis-e-Ulema (MMU), the largest amalgam of religious, social and educational organisations of Jammu and Kashmir led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has condemned the attack on Gaza hospital that killed over 500 people on Tuesday. 

In a joint statement, issued MMU expressed shock and outrage and said the people of J&K are deeply saddened and pained by this unfolding tragedy and stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine.

The statement reads that it is a blatant war crime under United Nations Charter and the Geneva Conventions, and the people of Palestine are being collectively punished by Israel and all their human rights have been snatched from them.

MMU urged the UN and world powers to move beyond blame game and partisanship, and see what is happening in Gaza for what it is humanitarian crisis.

It urged them to ensure that the war against hapless Palestinian citizens is stopped and a resolution to this long term conflict is immediately sought.

It also urged the muslim countries to unite and stand with the Palestinian people and ensure they get justice.

instagram,"One positive outcome from this conflict is that many conversations will be had‚Äîbetween different groups, between different people of the same group, and even between people who didn‚Äôt know anything about the nuances of the situation before it happened. 

The worst way to start a conversation about it is by assuming that your POV is the correct, unbiased perspective and that theirs is mostly propaganda. 

That‚Äôs probably going to result in an argument or with the other person becoming unresponsive. 

Time may reveal (as it has done on many occasions before) that actually, it was the other way around. Or that each side contained a bit of truth and a bit of propaganda. 

In the meantime, let people get informed however they wish, share what they wish, and consider ALL sides. 

And when you discuss it with them, stay as open to their perspective as you would like for them to be open to yours. 

That‚Äôs how true understanding begins.

President Biden announced today that the United States is providing $100 million in humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. This funding will help support over a million displaced and conflict-affected people with clean water, food, hygiene support, medical care, and other essential needs. The United States provides humanitarian assistance through trusted partners including UN agencies and international NGOs.

Civilians are not to blame and should not suffer for Hamas‚Äôs horrific terrorism. Civilian lives must be protected and assistance must urgently reach those in need. We will continue to work closely with partners in the region to stress the importance of upholding the law of war, supporting those who are trying to get to safety or provide assistance, and facilitating access to food, water, medical care, and shelter.",,1228,"{'like_count': 794, 'comment_count': 434, 'num_users': 74966}",U.S. Embassy Cairo,,2023-10-18 18:37:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/97224874_166099848175651_7655409545874767872_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nFM9vfsNdzwAX--8SFa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDZ1eGr2uh98gQmsoVRqn8mPEeFZtY7yof-20PJa9KCyw&oe=6559C555,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyjOyVcrzjO/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/394210663_18359667967074951_6013903785653303672_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ztDNOfoByjUAX_birEG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCpXk0FHGHKBT1mWVXCLYHj0QvWwvp6Mx4Fs_kYYYKF6w&oe=655AB691

instagram,"Join the rally for Gaza this Friday, 5pm, Bryant Park - bit.ly/ceasefirerally

We demand an immediate ceasefire.

Palestinians are on the brink of a genocide, and our government is bankrolling it. Every year, the US sends over $3 billion in military aid‚Äînow being used to rain bombs on Gaza. As Americans, we are not observers in this conflict, we are actors. That‚Äôs why we are joining calls around the world and directing them at our government to call for an immediate ceasefire, to open humanitarian aid flows into Gaza, and to end US funding for war crimes.

Over 3,300 Palestinians have been killed since last Saturday, over 1,000 of them children. One child has been killed every 15 minutes in 11 days of airstrikes. Over one million people have been displaced. There are no bomb shelters in Gaza. Hospitals have run out of painkillers, and ice cream trucks are being used to store bodies. Water is scarce.

Ceasefire is the only way for the deaths to stop. Ceasefire is the only way to bring hostages home. Ceasefire is what every person of conscience must be demanding. Ceasefire now, let in humanitarian aid, end military aid, end the blockade, end the occupation, end apartheid.

Join us on Friday at 5p, stand on the right side of history, and call for a ceasefire.

instagram,"Young Maltese influencer @sarah_alfalah has used her massive social media following to condemn the ""ongoing ethnic cleansing in Palestine and the apparent indifference of various ethnicities towards it"".

""This feels like a load off my chest,"" the 23-year-old wrote on Instagram yesterday, addressing her 219,000 followers. ""Use your privileged voices! Been writing and deleting this back and forth, contemplating whether to post it or not, but what the hell? Yes! I‚Äôm sharing this! This is real life! If I‚Äôm not gonna use my voice now, then when?""

""If you're at home, simply consuming news and scrolling through social media while ignoring the situation, without taking a stand, you're contributing to this tragedy. Your inaction enables the continuation of suffering.""

In the series of notes shared as an Instagram carousel, Sarah not only condemned the ongoing conflict... but also made her point very clear when it came to Hamas.

""Hamas is like ISIS,"" she wrote. ""You can't blame a nation for activists from different countries. The media will paint it that it is an activism from the country they want to destroy, like they did before with ISIS.""

""Killers are in every country, you don't use a group of killers to manslaughter a nation.""

""I know what it feels like to have relatives shot dead or to have your father trapped in a war that both the world and their own attacked and bombed,"" Alfalah confessed.

""Hearing bombs while the land line cuts. Spent two years of my life living with that fear and still going to school as a 12-year-old, privileged enough to be half-Maltese and not to experience a fraction of what he experienced in Libya.""

""But those people are not privileged,"" Alfalah continued. ""They need our privileged voices! So does Yemen and Syria, left behind from the world, uncared for.""

""And If you‚Äôre selfish, remember that most countries are allies and your country might wake up tomorrow and decide to fight a war,"" the young influencer finished.

instagram,"We learn how safe it is to connect and communicate authentically with people, from our parents. Based on how they respond to us, how they connect, on how willing they are to love us fully in spite of our flaws.‚Å£
But if you were raised by people who hadn‚Äôt quite got to grips with their own trauma, and who couldn‚Äôt offer you emotional  safety and reliability, it will make your adult relationships harder.

Emotionally immature parents create confusion for their children. This of course is unlikely to be their fault, but the impact is the same regardless. A confusion of roles. Conditional love. Years of misunderstandings and skewed communication. 

If you want to reset and relearn how to have relationships that feel fulfilling instead of confusing, The Healthy Relationships Roadmap is for you. 

It will supercharge your self-awareness and will give you an understanding of dynamics and relating that will transform how you understand other people.

Having healthy, balanced, meaningful relationships is a skill you can learn. 

The course is pre-recorded and you get lifetime access when you sign up so you can take your time. 

It will help you;

üå∑Connect the dots between your childhood and your current relationships

üå∑ Work on yourself - your inner child, your emotional regulation and reparenting yourself

üå∑Learn how to engage in healthy conflict

üå∑Stop people pleasing and codependency and start having balanced relationships 

üå∑Understand the dynamics that are happening below the surface of your relationships, and change the ones that aren‚Äôt working

instagram,"1/2 posts... It is so great we are having conversations about the mental load...
There has been so much chat about my interview the other day in which @fitzywippakate and I talked about the mental load. Unfortunately, when you get a 90sec grab from a longer conversation some of the nuance can be missed so I really wanted to just post a bit more about that here.
First of all I want to clarify that while I mention in this grab that women's tendency to worry about a whole lot of things is biological, that isn't the WHOLE story. As I have written in several of my books, gender is more fluid than fixed, and while respecting biological, neurological and hormonal differences, there is not an ‚Äòall men‚Äô or ‚Äòall women‚Äô reality.
ON TOP OF THAT, there is social conditioning that is deeply embedded in culture and ancestry. Women are socially conditioned to take care of others and be people pleasers, as I write in my book Girlhood. Just as men are conditioned to be protectors and the strong, silent types. It's not about blaming and shaming each other -- as this story on The Project illustrates well, this conditioning creates a lot of silent expectations on mums and dads, so it can cause conflict.
Hopefully having these conversations is about creating greater understanding of what might be at play here so we can then challenge it and parent together better. ... cont 1/2",,1142,"{'like_count': 1129, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 131751}",Maggie Dent,,2023-10-18 00:27:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/67584554_434875963770077_8754538861431881728_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=BChEWlmYBqMAX_UWZ4y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC_z_Y_VabldPSrZWrjBvLCQg3NcKxSuRNKtQxeQchsig&oe=6559F379,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyhSAfcPwuh/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393076794_324491360168977_3960084263851949555_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ILd00YZs6x8AX9PdVxn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDfxVXuehhHd6Q6JAsmR3GjcZPi4Rfcf4bYo7yYTxuNNw&oe=65471F5F

instagram,"This lesson is about creating a balance in convictions, not to talk down on dreams. A balance that the God who spoke to you can also minister confirmation to the other person one way or another.

Convictions and confirmations are mutual. Same Angel who appeared to Mary also appeared to Joseph. That order hadn't changed. 

Although, God might speak to you in one way and speak to the other person another way. But the end goal is that you're both convinced in your heart that you have God's approval to carry on. 

Please, never do anything if that relationship is in conflict with your inner peace. 

And oh, desire to walk in every form God speaks to His people, even if it's in small measures, be open to the experience.

Sometimes, we can't choose how God speaks for us per time, He chooses the best medium to reach out due to our current level of spiritual discernment. 

 You will be putting yourself at a disadvantage if you have a problem with God speaking to you by dream, because when God uses this medium to reach you, you will never believe nor entertain it.

instagram,"Can we endure discomfort and talk about our true feelings to others, even if we know that it will make them feel unhappy? Rather than honestly addressing the situation, we often become afraid of conflict, thereby prolonging the dysfunctional circumstance by not saying anything. However, this only causes us to bottle up our feelings, which eventually erupts at the most unfortunate times, damaging the relationship much more than necessary. 

To remedy this, can we make a habit of letting people know, without aggression, how we feel whenever we notice a notable red flag in our relationship? We can‚Äôt blame them for not changing their behavior when they are unaware of how it is impacting us. So, let‚Äôs muster our courage and communicate what we see as a problem. This approach might even earn their respect.

It‚Äôs crazy to think that I started this page in 2018 when I got my little white JK, and ran that thing into the ground. Little did I know this page would open my world to opportunities and allow me to meet incredible people from all over the world. 

Swipe -> to see 2018 me. A girl who was lost, working two jobs and fighting her way through college. She was overcoming trauma and closing doors to those who caused the trauma and setting firm boundaries for herself. She didn‚Äôt know it then, but she was starting a new chapter in her life. She started speaking up, and speaking out and never backed down from any conflict placed in front of her. Looking back now, I‚Äôm proud of her in more ways than one. 

Today, I stand before you after facing the greatest yet most trying year of my life. I‚Äôve learned so much in such a short amount of time about myself, about my relationships with others and about how I handle the things going on around me. 

I am 10 months in Lupus remission, and haven‚Äôt had a flare up since December of 2022. I‚Äôve been off all of the medications and I‚Äôve finally able to focus on my health for the last 10 months. With that, it‚Äôs lead me to finding my true authentic purpose in life, along with my true authentic self. 
Physical and mental health truly get put on the back burner when you‚Äôre not in a healed place in your life, and now that I am on the road to healed and can make those things a priority, life has just been.. better! 

I‚Äôve received countless DMs asking for fitness and nutrition help and I‚Äôm happy to start diving in a little deeper with you guys in regards to those things. @sashameetsfitness has truly helped me get back on track with her encouraging words and friendship! I highly recommend following her and joining her programs for a better understanding on personal health and fitness. 

As always, thank you to everyone who‚Äôs been there and who have taken the time out of their lives to give a damn about mine! I am beyond thankful for the relationships this industry has brought to me and for the opportunities I‚Äôve earned and worked so hard for. 

It‚Äôs only up from here. 

I love you guys.

US President Joe Biden has arrived in Israel in a desperate bid to prevent the war with Hamas from spiralling into a wider conflict after a devastating blast on a Gaza hospital killed 500 people. 

Biden was received by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he touched down at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv this morning amid warnings the war is 'spiralling out of control' following the deadly fireball explosion at the hospital.

A huge blast ripped through the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City last night while it was being used to treat and shelter thousands of civilians who were trying to avoid Israel's relentless airstrikes. 

Earlier on, President Biden was left outraged and deeply saddened"" by hospital explosion in Gaza

""I am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted,"" he said. 

""Immediately upon hearing this news, I spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened. The United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy.""",,1001,"{'like_count': 831, 'comment_count': 170, 'num_users': 316238}",Hausa Room,,2023-10-18 10:39:31,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/309901883_1330220061139036_3961425463436087678_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NNp0RJ0mqJIAX_NxUxz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAllQfnxPWV22UMDHpyGjI2rjXPvsEpaFhTr-LMQv-uAg&oe=655A50EA,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyiYDPgM06r/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393361336_821366029741056_7172670908146544850_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=xzaqS4lTmb8AX-Y91Q2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA5mq_pdISvO5FEv8eYpwgsgNsx6LeSJYd8Ms4Iw-MUKQ&oe=653574FD

instagram,"I‚Äôve had a few messages on here over the last ten days asking where is my outrage over the events in Israel and Gaza during the past brutal ten days. 

To be honest I haven‚Äôt known how to say it or how to articulate my emotions at the horrors unfolding. 

So many well intentioned posts I‚Äôve read have ended up becoming a storm of initial disagreement and then hatred. 

Its left a lot of people, like me, not knowing what to say or how to say it, whilst feeling equally uncomfortable at remaining silent. 

It is possible and should be absolutely OK to have compassion and righteous anger about what is happening on both sides of this tragic conflict. 

It‚Äôs not about taking sides, it‚Äôs about that innate belief in the sanctity of human life. 

To cry out in anger and compassion for the unimaginable loss and pain being suffered by countless innocent families in Gaza is a perfectly human response to an inhumane situation.

To struggle to even comprehend the trauma and agony of those poor Israeli families affected by the events of October 7th and weep over the needless lives lost and kidnapped is another perfectly understandable human response to an act of unimaginable evil. 

Whatever the conflict, whatever side of the division, the loss and suffering of innocent men, women and children is always unspeakably tragic and never justified. 

As a father my heart breaks for the parents in Israel and Gaza who are suffering the unimaginable.",,988,"{'like_count': 988, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 112495}",ùôéùôûùô¢ùô§ùô£ ùôèùôùùô§ùô¢ùôñùô®,,2023-10-18 15:06:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/324380201_1341484939936050_3739158289028679327_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=aMk1wNJO6kYAX8eKJ9X&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC5W3nbNRZhUMqLCDDN7-6tnhI-zY7Jg4irB14J7Uel2A&oe=655A0342,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyi2mkgMp5O/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392765104_670949058338303_4811431468599231969_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CBUW74v6CXcAX-1N_uF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD-4kGA4loFVrv2NB4lkdAWW9kM221o6NGGXdELrReC3w&oe=655A8136

instagram,"New Delhi: Campaigning in Mizoram for the November 7 assembly polls heated up this week with the arrival of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for a two-day trip to the north-eastern state.

Two days in a row ‚Äì October 16 and 17 ‚Äì Gandhi not only grabbed considerable public attention in the state but also seized national headlines. His party‚Äôs state unit had been eagerly awaiting his arrival to declare the candidates‚Äô list for the assembly polls.

As planned, the party named candidates for 39 of the state‚Äôs 40 seats, leaving one seat to be decided soon.

On day one, he carried out a padyatra along the lines of his successful Bharat Jodo Yatra in Aizawl city. The four-to-five kilometre walk stretched between the Chanmari area of the capital to the Raj Bhavan.

Addressing a rally thereafter, he carried out a frontal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for being more ‚Äúinterested‚Äù in addressing Israel-Hamas conflict than ‚Äúgiving importance‚Äù to Manipur. 

Stating to the public that he didn‚Äôt understand why Modi did not visit Manipur, which has been facing ethnic strife since this past May, Gandhi called it ‚Äúshameful‚Äù for the leader of the country not to visit a state after such mindless violence. 

Calling the Manipur violence a symptom of the problem with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he stated, ‚ÄúPeople from minority communities are feeling uncomfortable and there is oppression being carried out on the people of India under its rule.‚Äù

instagram,"In a simple straw shed, Sudanese refugee Zeinab seeks refuge from haunting nightmares of her husband's tragic death in Sudan.

When armed men attacked her house, they ‚Äã‚Äãshot her husband and his five brothers while Zeinab hid with her two children. Fearing for their lives as the conflict escalated, she made the dangerous journey to Chad, where she now has shelter and hopes to provide for her children's education and needs.

Conditions for Sudanese refugees like Zeinab are dire, as camps are overcrowded. Refugees live in makeshift shelters and have limited access to basic services such as water, healthcare, and food.

Despite being one of the poorest countries in the world, Chad is now hosting over 423,000 people who have fled Sudan recently. They need urgent support.

instagram,"All or nothing thinking is extremely common after trauma.

üí°You might have heard it called ‚Äúbinary thinking‚Äù, ‚Äúdichotomous thinking‚Äù or ‚Äúblack-and-white thinking‚Äù.

Thinking in extremes (all or nothing) feels safe especially when you don‚Äôt trust yourself or your perspective.

Problem is when there‚Äôs little room for nuance, gray areas, ambiguity, it‚Äôs extremely challenging to develop healthy, safe, sustainable relationships with others.

Every situation for you falls into one of two buckets ‚Äî good or bad. Right or wrong. All or nothing.

üò¨Which neglects context.
üö©Leaves no room for humanness.
üëÄAvoids all conflict (even the healthy kind).

Why? Because you‚Äôre looking at them through a lens of good or bad in everything they do, say, think or feel.

This causes you to react, attack, or eliminate the relationship because there‚Äôs no room for understanding, differing opinions, alternate perspectives, growth, grace or forgiveness.

There‚Äôs two areas that need your attention if you‚Äôre thinking in extremes!

On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel's bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world's most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb.
Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.
On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

""As scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.""

instagram,"More than 150 USC students gathered Tuesday to march on campus in support of Palestine and to call for peace in Gaza. 

As the humanitarian crisis escalates, the United Nations has reported the death toll of 4,200 people and the displacement of over one million people since the Israel-Hamas conflict began ten days ago.
¬†
Students marched for more than two hours chanting in support of Palestine and calling for an end to Israel‚Äôs occupation. Gaza‚Äôs economy has been severely restricted by a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade since 2007 and hospitals are ill-equipped to handle the escalating medical crisis.
¬†
After the demonstration ended, a small group of Muslim students gathered in front of Tommy Trojan for the Maghrib prayer, the fourth of five daily prayers in the Islamic faith, held after sunset. Students prayed and mourned for the lives lost.

instagram,"At 10:30 a.m. on Oct. 18, over 80 Lowell students walked out of registry, joining a rally at the flagpole. Following speeches by rally organizers, participating students marched down Eucalyptus Drive calling for a cease-fire in the ongoing conflicts in Gaza. Speakers also called for teachers to teach about the conflict and for the U.S. to stop funding Israeli war efforts. 

The walkout, organized by Lowell‚Äôs Middle Eastern and North African Club (MENA), was just one of many occurring today across the district and the nation. ‚ÄúThis walkout is not just a single act, but a statement that our cry for freedom will never be silenced,‚Äù said junior Helena Awwad, who is the MENA co-president. 

The walkout consisted of speeches from the MENA club co-presidents, Awwad and sophomore Zayna Elkarra, whose family lives in Gaza. MENA club led a march down Eucalyptus Drive, where chants of ‚Äúfree, free Palestine‚Äù and ‚Äúsay no to genocide‚Äù filled the air. The walkout concluded with a moment of silence in Rolph Nicol Park, where the co-presidents made their final remarks.

Organizers were clear to separate the actions of the Israeli government from Israeli and Jewish people. ‚ÄúWe want to make it clear that when we are talking about Israel, we are not referring to Jewish people,‚Äù said Elkarra. ‚ÄúThe two need to be separated.‚Äù

Among the participants was Jewish student Caleb Darsky. ‚ÄúWhat motivated me to join the walkout today was seeing the amount of suffering on both sides in Israel and Palestine,‚Äù the  senior said. ‚ÄúI want to show solidarity because there‚Äôs a lot of miscommunication between Jews and Muslims, and Israelis and Palestinians. I hope that bringing my voice to this walkout can help bridge the gap.‚Äù

Organizers saw the walkout as a display of the power of student voices. ‚ÄúI absolutely believe that as youth in America, we cannot be silenced,‚Äù said Awwad. ‚ÄúThis is the time where we have to use our voices to educate people.‚Äù Elkarra echoed Awwad‚Äôs remarks: ‚ÄúI want the world to wake up, to really see and understand what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

instagram,"What happened: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada will provide an initial $10 million in humanitarian assistance. This funding supports life-saving efforts, including providing food, water, emergency medical assistance, and protection services. The move comes in response to the dire situation in the region due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.

Details: The humanitarian aid will be directed toward various organizations, including the Canadian Red Cross, the Palestine Red Crescent Society, and Magen David Adom. These organizations will scale their efforts to assist people in urgent need, particularly those internally displaced in Gaza and the West Bank.

Also: The Canadian government emphasized its commitment to ensuring that no funds would end up in the hands of Hamas, a declared terrorist organization. They mentioned implementing ""enhanced due diligence"" and anti-terrorism exercises to safeguard against such misuse of funds.

More: The situation in Gaza has worsened, with reports of shortages of essential supplies, including water and power. The UN has raised concerns about these actions violating international humanitarian law. The International Committee of the Red Cross also called for humanitarian access to Gaza through a neutral party to provide essential aid and facilitate communication between hostages and their families.

instagram,"Many pages are becoming vocal about this war between Israel & Hamas. After seeing the many posts about Israel striking a hospital in Gaza city last night, I did my own investigation. This war initially began through an attack launched by Hamas entering into civilian areas, taking hostages & slaughtering many. Jewish media reported that they raped & killed women & beheaded babies. Then a cry went out that Israel is lying & there is no evidence this happened. Nearly every page jumped on that bandwagon.

Yet when this hospital is hit, everyone is sharing posts, hopping on the ""let's all blame & hate Israel"" without any investigation. This is the double standard, double mindedness, & hypocrisy of people. All while being fueled by the International Media, Middle Eastern journalists & Hamas, who are obviously very biased & one sided. To be honest, people need to smarten up, especially Christians who are siding with the Islamic state.

This isn't about choosing sides though. I am not saying Israel are the good guys & everything they do is justified. What I'm saying is this hatred & violence towards Jews is rooted in the teachings of Islam, & the way Muhammed treated those who didn't affirm him as a prophet. This is not about land.

If we're going back decades to claim the land was taken from ""Palestinians"" then we need to go back further & understand the truth of the matter. Before this land was in the possession of Arabs, Jews & Christians lived there. The Ottoman Empire, a Muslim caliphate, invaded Jewish land who endured 600 years of systematic discrimination & persecution. This doesn't justify anything, but these are the facts.

After WW1, the Ottoman Empire fell, losing seated authority over the land, it was given over to the League of Nations & Britain (More info above).
When Egypt & Jorden once occupied the land, why didn't we hear an outcry of occupation? Because this is a religious conflict about hating Jews & not recognizing Israel as authoritative. All because Islam teaches that Muslims must dominate, not be the ones who are dominated. Egypt & Jordan being Muslim was not a problem of occupation, proving this has to do with Muslims having a problem with Jews.",,826,"{'like_count': 531, 'comment_count': 295, 'num_users': 40473}",YOUCANTSTOPTHETRUTH,,2023-10-18 15:47:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/122578612_1724466601050176_4998077298361862839_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=iyPAl6ZUVRcAX8ta9vi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDd1jz4N8n3-2gokAPwMO9MJhm3cRdk-7zbLySVvJnrdg&oe=655ABF17,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyi7VloOxzt/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392793077_980329066384016_7112790191569998426_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ldC710_up0YAX8K9S65&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAH004LN3xrX3b0XNprtp7g1lg_ZN1he1bMZWwTts7Piw&oe=65402616

instagram,"On behalf of @petaindia , I‚Äôve called upon the Hon‚Äôble Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Shri @devendra_fadnavis ji who is also the Home Minister of Maharashtra, to withdraw the relevant portion of the Government Resolution (GR) passed by the Home Department, Government of Maharashtra on 26 September imposing a ban on community animals and their feeding inside Mantralaya premises. Several dogs and cats have been peacefully coexisting inside Mantralaya premises for years together and they know no other home. The said portion of the GR is bad in law and hence must be withdrawn with immediate effect.
 
Persons who feed community animals are merely discharging their fundamental duty as envisaged under Article 51(A)(g) of the Constitution of India. Article 51(A)(g) imposes a fundamental duty on every citizen to have ‚Äúcompassion for living creatures‚Äù, which certainly includes community animals.
 
Designated spots for feeding community animals inside Mantralaya premises must be allocated in accordance with the purpose and intent of the Animal Welfare Board of India‚Äôs circular dated 26 February 2015. Feeding creates friendly animals thereby reducing human/animal conflict and cases of dog bites.
 
The Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court of India in its judgment in Animal Welfare Board of India v. A Nagaraja has held that all animals have a fundamental right to live with honour and dignity and lead lives free from cruelty. The imposition of any kind of restriction on the feeding of community animals or their removal or any cruelty inflicted on them would be in direct contravention of this judgment.

On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel‚Äôs bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 16 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus. More than 1,000 children have been killed by these attacks on Gaza and many more injured.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.‚Äù

The young Meiteis and Kukis joined hands to make a friendly football match in the national capital a success, far away from their conflict-ridden home ‚Äî a place they call India‚Äôs ‚Äúmainland‚Äù.

They do not see eye to eye, and, if needed, they train guns at each other. However, 2,450 km away from their villages in Manipur, the same young people became part of a football tournament in Delhi that saw camaraderie, respect and love for sports.

The horrific experience of a helpless parent watching his ill child struggle to breathe made me reflect on the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine, and how it is extremely heartbreaking to witness the loss of innocent lives, many of whom are children, the elderly and woman.

I don‚Äôt condone the actions of either side and in my opinion we should advocate for peace, irrespective of any ‚Äúsides.‚Äù

In my opinion, we are all human and we need to start recognising the value of every single life, regardless of nationality or identity.

Some words speak straight to the heart, without the need for flashy rhetoric. Jimin‚Äôs language does just that. We offer you his genuine warmth and honesty in his own authentic voice, in words that are quintessentially Jimin.
‚ÄúTo get to where we are now, our team has faced considerable struggles, occasionally losing our way and experiencing conflict, but always supporting each other. The joy, sorrow, pain, delight, and love we‚Äôve felt along the way‚Äîwe‚Äôve been candid about it all. I think these emotions struck a chord with people. So, in the end, it‚Äôs not really about language, but the heart that bridges the gap.‚Äù
Visit gqkorea.co.kr now to access the full interview and photoshoot with Jimin, whose very being embodies honest expression. And don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe festivities of ‚ÄúJimtober‚Äù are far from over.

instagram,"‚ÄúWe write in grief as the full force of the world‚Äôs fifth-strongest army rains bombs down on the people of Palestine, that part of Palestine known to the world today as the Gaza Strip. We grieve as we witness unequivocal military, political, and diplomatic support of Western governments for an Israeli aggression unprecedented since 1948. We write in grief today, October 17, as the latest Israel air assault has targeted the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist Hospital in Gaza City. Thousands of civilians were seeking treatment and shelter from relentless bombardment; the assault has killed at least 500 people, including patients and medical staff. Today, too, Israel struck a United Nations school housing refugees.

We write in grief for the Palestinian and Israeli people who have lost loved ones to the ravages of military conflict. We were filled with dread witnessing Hamas‚Äôs gruesome operation on October 7. That operation and its aftermath has killed 1,300 Israelis and injured another 3,621, with a further estimated 199 or more Israeli hostages ‚Äî both soldiers and civilians ‚Äî and some foreign nationals taken by Hamas. There is no justification for the targeting of civilians in any context. We write in grief for all civilian life.

We witnessed message after message from universities and corporations that populated our inboxes and screens expressing empathy, outrage, and unconditional support for the state of Israel and its people. We witnessed as two battlefields merged in front of us: one, on the ground, where the besieged and enclosed people in the Gaza Strip face relentless and indiscriminate bombardment; and another, in language, where powerful public discourse coalesces around speaking of Palestinian people as ‚Äúhuman animals.‚Äù U.S. politicians have called for the ‚Äúeradication‚Äù of Palestinians and to ‚Äúlevel‚Äù the Gaza Strip. The rising rhetoric of ‚Äúbarbarism‚Äù and ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù speeded the message that Israeli and U.S. generals and politicians alike relayed: There are no innocent civilians in Gaza.‚Äù

üé® As artists and cultural producers, our work has the power to shape public opinion. Today, as the media wages a war against truth and strips this conflict of its historical context, we have a unique responsibility to use our voice and artistic practices to say NO MORE!
Now is the time to protest apartheid and amplify the just cause of the Palestinian people and their resistance against 75 years of occupation.

Artists and cultural workers, join us in standing firmly on the side of the oppressed. We say DOWN WITH OCCUPATION, UP WITH LIBERATION!

instagram,"What happened: US President Joe Biden visited Tel Aviv in Israel amid the ongoing conflict with Hamas, signaling a significant diplomatic move during the crisis. His arrival took place against the backdrop of a surprise attack by Hamas on Israel and Israel's counteroffensive launched on October 7. During a bilateral meeting with Netanyahu, Biden told him that the blast at the Al-Ahil in Gaza hospital appeared to have been done by the other team and not you"".

Details: During a bilateral meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Biden emphasized the United States' commitment to supporting Israel and ensuring the nation has the necessary resources for self-defense. Notably, Biden commented on the recent blast at the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, suggesting that it appeared to be the result of actions by a group distinct from Israel, alluding to the complexity and challenges of the ongoing conflict in the region.

Some words speak straight to the heart, without the need for flashy rhetoric. Jimin‚Äôs language does just that. We offer you his genuine warmth and honesty in his own authentic voice, in words that are quintessentially Jimin.
‚ÄúTo get to where we are now, our team has faced considerable struggles, occasionally losing our way and experiencing conflict, but always supporting each other. The joy, sorrow, pain, delight, and love we‚Äôve felt along the way‚Äîwe‚Äôve been candid about it all. I think these emotions struck a chord with people. So, in the end, it‚Äôs not really about language, but the heart that bridges the gap.‚Äù
Visit gqkorea.co.kr now to access the full interview and photoshoot with Jimin, whose very being embodies honest expression. And don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe festivities of ‚ÄúJimtober‚Äù are far from over.

instagram,"The Path to Peace: Presenting Asian Paints Miss Universe Nepal 2023 National Costume ‚ú® 

A world flawed by conflict often leads us to confine the dove, symbolizing peace, within a cage. However, it is high time we free the essence of peace and contain the destructive power of missiles instead. 

We are translating this powerful concept into an artistic costume, aiming to convey a profound message of peace, a sentiment deeply ingrained in Nepal's identity as a peace-loving nation. Nepal represents peace through its longstanding commitment to non-violence, its peaceful coexistence with diverse cultures, and its status as a neutral and harmonious nation. 

The costume is meticulously designed in colors that resonate with the choices of peace advocates, symbolizing their unwavering commitment to the cause of peace. ‚òÆÔ∏è

instagram,"Dispatches from Lebanon
Funerals were held to mourn Hezbollah members in the town of Khirbet Selm, southern Lebanon, on October 10, 2023, as tensions escalated along the Lebanon-Israel border.
Fears of conflict with Israel have grown in Lebanon following the exchange of missiles.
Observers are concerned that Hezbollah's participation in the conflict against Israel would devastate Lebanon and escalate regional tensions.

in July 2006, Hezbollah seized two Israeli soldiers on its border, leading to a significant military response from Israel. The conflict endured for 34 days and resulted in the loss of approximately 1,100 Lebanese lives and 165 Israelis.

instagram,"In a maze of shrimp farms, fish ponds and rice fields, fishing cats must tread carefully. In southern Thailand, a fragmented, increasingly human-dominated landscape can lead to human-cat conflict over livestock. Our Panthera Thailand team is actively protecting fishing cats, which are listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

To tackle this challenge head-on, our team has activated a five-year action plan for the species. The team has now fitted 11 fishing cats with GPS collars to better understand their movement. They've also surveyed local people to get a better sense of the conflict between humans and fishing cats, which has helped them design educational programs intended to promote peaceful coexistence between humans and their feline neighbors.

instagram,"The atrocities unfolding
in Gaza are horrific.

My heart breaks.
My mind breaks.

I am so sorry for all of this death, grief
and irreversible tragedy for Palestinians and Israelis.

I‚Äôm aching everyday, seeing a growing war that has been lingering for years‚Ä¶an uproar due to poking the most fragile conflict that lives at the seed of humanities pain, dehumanization, corruption and violence.

The more I open to learn about the complexities at play, a conflict that has way more sides in the mix that lurk in the shadows, what I find is an unimaginable mess, with different power agendas in every direction.

I am barely sharing what people are posting. This is because I continue to find over simplified perspectives on a situation that is the most nuanced and complex geopolitical and spiritual tension of our time that stretches back way more than 75 years.

I stand for a safe and free Palestine.
I stand for a safe and free Israel.
I stand for the Israeli government
occupation to back the fuck up.

It is disheartening and haunting to see world powers exploiting innocent people and this fragility in the Middle East for their interests.

The more we allow this conflict and the social media wars to separate us, the more we play into the hands of those powers who seek to divide us.
Question your assumptions.

There is no simple answer. I‚Äôm sorry, it really just isn't that simple despite the deep emotional agony, the yearning for an obvious answer, and to find resolution.

This is utterly fucked, and there is no one direction at fault. The game being played by world powers is bigger. than we can imagine.

Stay together.
Heal the wars inside ourselves.
Tend your heart and loved ones.

instagram,"Yesterday, the 11th day of Israel‚Äôs bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 1000 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On October 15th, 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.‚Äù

instagram,"POLICE AWARE OF PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES ORGANISED IN RELATION OF ISRAEL CONFLICT

The Police are aware of events and public assemblies being organised in relation to the Israel-Hamas conflict. The National Parks Board (NParks) has also received applications to use the Speakers‚Äô Corner for events related to the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The Police have assessed that there are public safety and security concerns associated with such events, given the heightened tensions. NParks shares the same concerns. There have been numerous incidents of violence reported in many countries amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. For instance, an Israeli staff from the Israeli Embassy in Beijing was stabbed in front of a supermarket, and a teacher was fatally stabbed by a Chechen individual in France. The peace and harmony between different races and religions in Singapore should not be taken for granted, and we must not let events happening externally affect the internal situation within Singapore. Given the sensitivity of the topic and the volatility of the situation overseas, there is a real risk that such events could give rise to public disorder. As such, applications to hold such events will be turned down.

The Police would like to remind members of the public that public assemblies in Singapore are regulated under the Public Order Act 2009, and that organising or participating in a public assembly without a Police permit in Singapore constitutes an offence under the Public Order Act 2009. The Police will not grant any permit for assemblies that advocate political causes of other countries or foreign entities, or may have the potential to stir emotions and lead to public order incidents.

The Police would also like to remind members of the public to engage in responsible and respectful discussions on this topic, online or otherwise, and avoid making insensitive or offensive remarks about race or religion, which may threaten Singapore‚Äôs racial and religious harmony.

instagram,"As wholly expected, and in line with decades of its foreign policy, Washington has thrown its full weight behind ‚Äústanding with Israel‚Äù and its genocidal onslaught on Gaza. But while the two allies' public stances line up prettily at this stage of the conflict, their views diverge on what comes next - specifically over the elimination of Hamas and other Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza. 

The devastating impact of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on the occupation state has presented an opportunity for the US and Israel to permanently eradicate the threat posed by the Palestinian resistance.

As the resistance's unprecedented political, military, and psychological gains began to sink in, Washington immediately jumped into the fray.

Repost @latinxparenting ‚Äî‚Äî

Rp: @sirianajanine: ‚ÄúBut why is a preschool teacher posting about Palestine? That‚Äôs so political.‚Äù

Kindly see yourself out, because you‚Äôre most likely a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù person who doesn‚Äôt say this when I speak out against every other injustice that affects marginalized and oppressed peoples. 

The story of Palestine is the first injustice and struggle for liberation that I ever learned about. üáµüá∏ It‚Äôs what brought me to my work. 

In the past, Palestinians and their allies have been silenced and threatened for speaking out about the colonization of their land. 

In fact, until recently, people and governments would falsely call you antisemitic if you even said the name ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù, and not ‚ÄúPalestinian territories.‚Äù This was intentionally meant to suppress solidarity and the truth about Palestine, while it also meant that antisemitism (a very present and dangerous form of bigotry against Jewish people) was misrepresented as criticizing Israel‚Äôs violent establishment and ethnic cleansing. 

And with so much false information and deflection that continues to frame Palestine as a ‚Äútwo-sided, complicated, religious conflict‚Äù, I had to speak out and share my lifetime of knowledge and research on the Palestinian struggle for justice. 

Please amplify Palestinian voices. Please listen to Jewish voices when they stand in solidarity and tell Israel to stop colonizing Palestine in the name of their religion. Israeli genocide does not represent Judaism. Justice for one is justice for all. 

I invite you to continue reading Palestinian stories and speaking with your children about Palestine, the way you do with all forms of racism and oppression. 

You are welcome to ask me questions to help you unlearn the anti-Palestinian and orientalist rhetoric we‚Äôve all been taught. You are NOT welcome to attack me by falsely claiming my solidarity with Palestinians is antisemitic. 

There is hope. There is light. Freedom begins with knowledge.

instagram,"My dear 20‚Äôs,
Your chapters could fill a library. I dipped my toes in every genre: romance, tragedy, comedy, adventure, and places and events so surreal it felt like sci-fi. 

There were near death experiences, natural disasters, world travel, wild animals, heroic rescue missions, maybe a sprinkling of breaking the law‚Ä¶
 I danced, and loved deeply, and made lasting artwork and impressions. I saw all 50 states, and 20 different countries and collected memories and scars.

In the months leading up to turning 30, many many people had comments about it being a turning point, an end, time to settle down, to slow. But every day of my 20s I was just picking up speed hitting my stride. There was a time where I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it to 18, or 21, or 25‚Ä¶times where maybe I didn‚Äôt even want to. But now I‚Äôm grateful for every day. A new high score, and 30 feels more like a beginning. 

I‚Äôm going into 30 without some of the traditional markers of success that feel as though they‚Äôre expected, but after 3 decades I‚Äôve realized my definition of success is different than the status quo. 

I am grateful for the people I‚Äôve loved, each one taught me lessons and skills and I carry pieces of them with me. 

I am grateful to be so close with my mother, and for the determination and bravery I inherited from her. I am also grateful for the wandering soul and adventurous spirit I take from my father. Being two different halves, one that‚Äôs is so stable and strong for others like a lighthouse anchored in one place, and one that yearns to explore and take flight and follow where the wind blows, has been a constant conflict for me. Sometimes I feel like I cannot connect or fit quite right anywhere. 

My goal for the next 30 years is to keep living authentically to myself. Keep being wild, and loving wild things. To keep being eccentric and enthusiastic and not become jaded, and to keep doing the things that scare me. 

(This photoshoot was an adventure that involved a 15 mile hike and mild hypothermia with 45mph winds and Ice In a dressüòÇ)

In the Dewan Rakyat today, the DAP chairman was condemning Israeli aggression at the beginning of his debate speech on the 2024 Supply Bill when he was interrupted by the PAS MP, who asked whether DAP had issued an official statement on Gaza.

Marzuk raised the question because he claimed that some countries in the region are standing with Israel. However, he did not name any country.

instagram,"Lots of Mommas and my educator community looking for resources and reflection space to root us in talking to our children.

I‚Äôll keep gathering resources and echoing voices.

Rp: @sirianajanine: ‚ÄúBut why is a preschool teacher posting about Palestine? That‚Äôs so political.‚Äù

Kindly see yourself out, because you‚Äôre most likely a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù person who doesn‚Äôt say this when I speak out against every other injustice that affects marginalized and oppressed peoples. 

The story of Palestine is the first injustice and struggle for liberation that I ever learned about. üáµüá∏ It‚Äôs what brought me to my work. 

In the past, Palestinians and their allies have been silenced and threatened for speaking out about the colonization of their land. 

In fact, until recently, people and governments would falsely call you antisemitic if you even said the name ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù, and not ‚ÄúPalestinian territories.‚Äù This was intentionally meant to suppress solidarity and the truth about Palestine, while it also meant that antisemitism (a very present and dangerous form of bigotry against Jewish people) was misrepresented as criticizing Israel‚Äôs violent establishment and ethnic cleansing. 

And with so much false information and deflection that continues to frame Palestine as a ‚Äútwo-sided, complicated, religious conflict‚Äù, I had to speak out and share my lifetime of knowledge and research on the Palestinian struggle for justice. 

Please amplify Palestinian voices. Please listen to Jewish voices when they stand in solidarity and tell Israel to stop colonizing Palestine in the name of their religion. Israeli genocide does not represent Judaism. Justice for one is justice for all. 

I invite you to continue reading Palestinian stories and speaking with your children about Palestine, the way you do with all forms of racism and oppression. 

You are welcome to ask me questions to help you unlearn the anti-Palestinian and orientalist rhetoric we‚Äôve all been taught. You are NOT welcome to attack me by falsely claiming my solidarity with Palestinians is antisemitic. 

There is hope. There is light. Freedom begins with knowledge.

""Killers of the Flower Moon""
- a novel by David Grann

ùêíùêòùêçùêéùêèùêíùêàùêí:
An American epic Western film¬†that is set in the 1920. After oil brought a fortune to the Native Osage Nation, it attracted the white Americans, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to numerous murders. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone.

ùêåùêò ùêëùêÑùêïùêàùêÑùêñ:
THIS IS CINEMA !!! My most awaited film of 2023 is here. Martin Scorsese is back with another masterpiece with his 2 beloved actors De Niro & Dicaprio, combining his crime expertise and injecting it into a western genre, and the result is DAMNNNNNNNNN. I CANT BELIEVE WHAT I JUST WITNESSED.

The film highlights the story of the Osages where they are being hunted by the white Americans 1 by 1. Highligting greed, corruption, and manipulation above everything else. It is a traumatic truth that was so painful to see. Thanks Scorsese for highlighting this important history for us.

There have been talks about the 3 hours runtime, but no minutes can be taken off here. Each & every scene fits their purpose. From the introduction of the characters, to the conflict, to the intense situation, and to the resolution. I love the structure as it absorbs us into the film.

Performance wise the 3 main cast nailed their roles, but it was Lily Gladstone that stole the show. Through her we can see a woman that went through pain, hopelessness, and desperation. Let's give Lily all the awards for this role, she deserves it.

This is a must watch film for those looking for peak cinema. Scorsese simply nailed every aspects of filmmaking and it feels personal too, especialy that artistic ending that feels like a love letter to cinema. Perhaps one of the finest films that I've seen.

2023 will go down as the contest between 'Oppenheimer' and 'Killers of Flower Moon', and regardless which side you are on, cinema wins (not theme park movies). This is the kind of film that shows what real cinema is, those layers, depths, and meanings.

instagram,"Free Palestine ~ Over the past few days, with help from this community, I have been educating myself about the conflict between Israel and Palestine.

I cannot continue to do this ancestral work and be in my integrity without taking a very clear stance on this.

I hold compassion for EVERYONE who has been affected by this conflict, who has suffered and been harmed. I grieve deeply for the violence on both sides.

And I cannot claim to walk this decolonial path without clearly stating that I am firmly against Israel as a colonial settler state committing genocide against the Palestinian people.

This conflict didn‚Äôt start this month, it has been going on for 75 years. The Palestinian people have been oppressed by apartheid, denied their basic rights, and have been killed in their fight for freedom.

I am not Palestinian, nor am I Israeli or Jewish. But I am an American whose tax dollars are being used to fund this genocide. If we Americans do not speak out and call our representatives, we are complict. We are colluding with colonial narratives and violence.

It is important for us to speak up in times like this. The more of us that speak up, the more we can normalize standing against colonial agendas and predatory power.

If you‚Äôre an American, you can use the resource in the image to call Congress and demand a ceasefire now. You‚Äôll also find the link in my bio. This resource is provided by Jewish Voice for Peace: @jewishvoiceforpeace.

Adding to this post:
I understand there's a complex history in these lands that's been going on for a very long time. I am not saying that Jews do not have an ancestral claim to these lands. I'm saying that Jews do not have the ONLY claim, and none of the history justifies Palestinians being denied their basic rights.

I condemn Hamas. I support Israel's right to fight terrorism, but there are other ways to deal with terrorists. What's happening in Gaza goes beyond the scope of anti-terrorism and will only cause more extremism, more terrorism, more violence. Killing Hamas at the expense of civilian lives & children will inspire more people to join Hamas.",,459,"{'like_count': 422, 'comment_count': 37, 'num_users': 60215}",Tara Brading,,2023-10-18 02:15:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/105962247_1101790726857918_4539702811573913989_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=YG79TxKT828AX-UESqQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCCjtNgg3_cxCmJA73cGdjGGuCjq7j2bCP3lvawBKvHBA&oe=655A3FC6,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyheXNWsaR9/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392872938_1697520840717432_9132111012697431172_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qcyrNoQlfSYAX8p3bZm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDKszD-b9p4bioncCoK2sqvLcb7qXEQ5WtUjCLbX4t45Q&oe=6559CE70

Hyderabad: Amid rising casualties in Gaza due to the Israel-Hamas war, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) announced a public meeting-protest on Monday, October 23 at Darussalam to condemn the atrocities on Palestinians.

Announcing the protest meeting, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi stated that the heads of all political parties and organisations will be invited to the protest for Gaza, however, ‚Äúno political/election speeches will be made.‚Äù

Several silent protests or flash protests are being regularly organised in Hyderabad in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah conflict that started this month.

A group of women is also organizing ‚ÄòQunoot-e-Nazila‚Äô prayers at the Eidgah Hazrath Ujaleshah at Sayeedabad in the city on Thursday, October 19 at 4:30 pm.

Israel-Hamas War, Gaza in trouble
The war began on Saturday, October 7, after Hamas infiltrated southern Israel, sending fighters, firing 5,000 rockets, and taking captives, including women, children, and the elderly, which prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn of ‚Äúa long and difficult war.‚Äú

Since then the Israeli forces have inflicted on the Palestinians several atrocities including cutting off their food, water and power supply. They have also bombed shelters, hospitals and escape routes out of the Gaza Strip and have cornered Palestinians in South Gaza asking them to flee the north as the US-backed army prepares for a ground invasion.

Gaza‚Äôs Ministry of Health said that at least 3,000 Palestinians have been killed, including 1,000 children, and 12,500 citizens injured so far due to Israeli attacks.

In Israel, the number of people killed in Hamas attacks reached 1,400, 302 Israeli soldiers, while more than 3,400 were injured.",,451,"{'like_count': 451, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 53867}",Hyderabad News Insta,,2023-10-18 21:29:41,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/319075348_834526007636091_7251464161281060085_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=R4r92QhOFH8AX8ybzhW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBUWv5yaI--VZn078AXWvIXLy1ycFd4-VVPmaUaDLkuWQ&oe=655A8132,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyjidPmLcNm/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392906250_3631669597114078_1609191225583505459_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=7JohFpw39jkAX-8rusi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA-3o515wZf5rBorJqavRbGwOQjcIXpxr4s9TxZ1pDpaw&oe=654E0A75

This funding will help support over a million displaced and conflict-affected people with clean water, food, hygiene support, medical care, and other essential needs. The United States provides humanitarian assistance through trusted partners including UN agencies and international NGOs.

‚ÄúCivilians are not to blame and should not suffer for Hamas‚Äôs horrific terrorism. 

Civilian lives must be protected and assistance must urgently reach those in need. We will continue to work closely with partners in the region to stress the importance of upholding the law of war, supporting those who are trying to get to safety or provide assistance, and facilitating access to food, water, medical care, and shelter,‚Äù said a White House statement. 

@POTUS and President Issac Herzog met today in Israel. The President reiterated the importance of the deep friendship between the two countries, and underscored the United States' unwavering support for Israel in face of Hamas' terrorism. ¬†

instagram,"In an effort to promote human-wildlife coexistence, @bornfreekenya has been a steadfast partner, implementing a range of innovative and community-centered conservation solutions around Meru National Park. 

One standout initiative is the introduction of beehive fencing, which deters elephants from crop raids in neighbouring community farms. By sponsoring the installation of beehives around the perimeter of the farms, Born Free is not only safeguarding crops but also enabling local farmers to generate additional income through honey production. 

To empower these communities even further, Born Free and KWS actively engage in community meetings, to address human-wildlife conflict issues comprehensively. By working closely with local communities, we aim to find innovative solutions that benefit both wildlife and the residents.

Through this collaborative approach, we envision a future where humans and wildlife coexist in harmony, ensuring the preservation of the natural world for generations to come.

instagram,"U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse commended President Joe Biden on Wednesday for pledging $100 million in U.S. humanitarian aid to Palestinians amid the Gaza conflict.

Earlier today, Reed and Whitehouse joined with 32 of their Senate colleagues in urging the Biden Administration to lead the international community in contributing to the United Nations‚Äô emergency appeal of $294 million to address the immediate humanitarian needs in the West Bank and Gaza. The United Nations said it plans to partner with 77 aid organizations to distribute humanitarian aid among those in need in Gaza and the West Bank.

‚ÄúAs a result of the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza prompted by Hamas‚Äô horrific terror attacks, more than 1.2 million people are in urgent need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance. More than one million people have fled the violence, stretching the already strained ability of the United Nations and humanitarian partners on the ground to provide the food, medical treatment, and shelter they need to survive,‚Äù the 34 U.S. Senators wrote.

The Senators continued: ‚ÄúWe support Israel‚Äôs right to defend its people against the brutal attacks carried out by Hamas. Hamas knew that the Israeli government would have to respond to the unconscionable murder and hostage-taking of its citizens and thus bears the blame for initiating this conflict. We also know there are many innocent Palestinians in Gaza who do not support Hamas and urgently need help as they seek to flee the fighting.‚Äù 

The Senators highlighted the dire situation facing innocent civilians in Gaza: ‚ÄúMore than one million people in Gaza have fled their homes in search of safety, with nearly half of those taking shelter in UN facilities. The United Nations estimates that Gaza will run out of food and water within days. Healthcare facilities are overwhelmed, running desperately short on supplies and impacted by the lack of electricity. The humanitarian needs on the ground have dramatically increased over the past week, and conditions will likely continue to deteriorate in the days and weeks ahead.‚Äù (Link in bio)

instagram,"On October 18, 1898 U.S. troops raised the U.S. flag over Puerto Rico, formalizing U.S. authority over the island‚Äôs one million inhabitants during the Spanish-American War.

Read background to this event in the excerpt below from ‚ÄúA Brief History of Puerto Rico‚Äù by Johnny Irizarry, Maria Mills-Torres, Marta Moreno Vega, and Anita Rivera in¬†Caribbean Connections: Puerto Rico:

‚Äú
After 400 years of Spanish domination, the island was now under the control of the United States. . . A new colonial era began in 1898. Puerto Rico was now ruled as a possession of the U.S. Conflict between the people and their new rulers emerged first over language. Illiteracy was widespread at that time, affecting 85 percent of the population, and the U.S. expected no resistance from the Puerto Ricans when it imposed English-only laws on the island. Puerto Rican intellectuals and independentistas (people who fight for Puerto Rican independence) resisted the replacement of the Spanish language with English. From 1898 until the establishment of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 1952, U.S. governors maintained some type of English-only law over Puerto Rico. In 1952, Spanish once again became the official language of Puerto Rico ‚Äî although the use of English continues to be required in some educational, governmental and judicial functions.

In 1917 President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones Act, which made Puerto Ricans citizens of the United States. Those who chose to reject U.S. citizenship would become exiles in their own homeland. Others left the island as a rejection of U.S. domination. U.S. citizenship, extended in the midst of World War I, brought with it the imposition of military service on Puerto Ricans.‚Äù

Our God is no stranger to grief. I am at a Middle East conference this week, praying with and for those who work in places of ongoing conflict. One of my friends suggested five ways to pray for Israel and Gaza:

1. Lost. Pray for lives lost and lost people. Pray that hearts would be awakened to bring and build physical and spiritual restoration. 
2. Leaders. Pray for international and national leaders, for wisdom and supernatural peace. 
3. Infrastructure. Pray for hospitals, schools, civil governments, local economy, and for the crippling sense of a challenged future. 
4. Church. Pray for the church in Israel and Gaza and throughout the Middle East. Pray for the people of God to carry the active peace of God. 
5. Work of the Spirit. Pray that the Spirit of the living God would move in ways beyond our expectation, restoring the breach, carrying peace. 

‚ÄúMy eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite, until the Lord from heaven looks down and sees; my eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the daughters of my city.‚Äù

instagram,"The recent outbreak of violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza threatens to upend decades of painstaking diplomacy by Morocco to broker peace between the two sides.

In early October 2023, Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas launched Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, firing barrages of rockets at Israeli towns and cities. They said it was in response to ‚ÄúIsraeli violations‚Äù at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. Israel responded with punishing airstrikes on Gaza. The fighting marked the worst escalation since the 2014 Gaza war.

For Morocco, the fresh violence represents a major setback. It comes just two years after Morocco agreed to normalize relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords, with the promise of being able to leverage these new ties to advance peace. Now, with tensions inflamed anew, Morocco‚Äôs unique role as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians faces its biggest test yet.

Morocco‚Äôs involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back to the 1950s and 1960s, when the late King Mohammed V expressed support for Palestinian statehood. In 1965, King Hassan II began actively promoting himself as an intermediary for peace.

instagram,"Israel has bombed a hospital in Gaza and killed at least 500 people, according to Palestinian officials.

Palestinian authorities said an Israeli airstrike hit the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City where civilians had been seeking shelter on Tuesday Oct 17.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said that at least 500 people had been killed.
The ministry said that hundreds of victims remain trapped under the rubble and the death toll is expected to rise

An Israeli military spokesperson said it was ‚Äúchecking‚Äù if it was responsible for the blast.

A later statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said another militant group was responsible for the bombing.

‚ÄúThe hospital was hit as a result of a failed rocket launched by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization,‚Äù Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said.

Islamic Jihad has denied the allegation.

‚ÄúWhat happened tonight is a huge tragedy and war ugly massacre that cannot be tolerated or allowed to pass without accountability,‚Äù Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said and blamed Israel for the airstrike.

The death toll of the incident is the highest since the war started on Oct. 7.

A school run by the United Nations that was housing refugees was also struck earlier in the day, killing six people, according to Al Jazeera.

Since declaring war on Palestinian militant group Hamas, Israel has ordered a complete blockade of Gaza ‚Äì home to more than two million Palestinians ‚Äì blocking food, water and fuel from entering

Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 2,700 Palestinians, nearly 10,000 have been injured and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes, according to Reuters.

Food, water and fuel are running low.

Meanwhile, 1,400 Israelis have died and 200 people have been taken hostage by Hamas.

The attack on the hospital came a day before US President Joe Biden was expected to visit Israel. (üì∏: Getty, üìù: @kassy)

instagram,"The African lion is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list of threatened species - their population has decreased by 75% in just five decades. Increasing human populations reduce available lion habitat, leading to a rise in human-lion conflict. Science and research are essential if we are to preserve future lion populations.

The @‚Äåsactrust (SACT), @tkpp_wildcru (TKPP) and Nelson Mandela University require GPS satellite collars to track the natural movement of lions between protected areas and develop lion management plans. These collars provide data to computer simulations that allow TKPP to monitor lion prides situated on park boundaries. They also provide an early-warning system to local communities about the whereabouts of lions and allow them to react quickly to potential problems and avoid human-lion conflict.

instagram,"When there is turbulence in the world, it can be a delicate balance for yoga teachers as we discern the difference between knowing what to say and knowing when to remain silent. Whether the conflict is political, societal, or global, I feel that it is important for us to help hold space for all emotions, opinions, and ways of being.

Over the years, I‚Äôve reflected on ways to create safe space during turbulent times, while recognizing that I am not a licensed therapist. To that end, I wanted to share some of the ways I have learned to show up for students without needing to have answers or inviting anger or conflict into the teaching space. Here are some of the principles that I follow as I try to walk that line.

instagram,"In 1999, @edward.said_ a Palestinian-American author/scholar, and @dbarenboim, an Israeli conductor/pianist, realized the urgent need for an alternative way to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The opportunity to do this came when Barenboim and Said initiated the first workshop using their experience as a model. This evolved into the West-Eastern @divanorchestra that global audiences know today. In a message written on Monday, October 16, and published on West-Eastern Orchestra website, Daniel Barendoim writes: ‚ÄúIn the current situation, we naturally ask ourselves about the significance of our joint work in both the orchestraand the academy. It may seem little-but the mere fact that Arab and Israeli musicians share a podium at every concert and make music together, that is of immense value to us. Over the years, through this commonality of music-making, but also through our countless, sometimes heated discussions, we have learned to better understand the supposed other, to approach them and to find common ground in our humanity and in music. We start and end all discussions, no matter how controversial, with the fundamental understanding that we are all equal human beings who deserve peace, freedom and happiness.‚Äù You can read the full message via the link in our bio. This spirit of empathy and recognition of the integral role music can play in all our lives‚Äîin times of happiness and in times of great tragedy‚Äîis at the core of Princeton University Concerts (PUC) #HealingWithMusic initiatives.

instagram,"""The fastest way to change society is to mobilise the women of the world."" ‚Äî Charles Malik¬†
¬†
In the midst of global turmoil, my heart aches for all those facing sadness and conflict. There is a lot of intense energy around us, urging us to come together and make change. As a woman and a healer, I'm moved to share my wisdom more than ever. 

Women, we are the healers, the nurturers, the life-bringers. Our bodies are designed to feel deeply, we need to work with this powerful portal energy. 

But, for too long, our emotions and health issues have been misunderstood, overlooked, or labeled as ""crazy"" or ""hormonal.""
¬†
I am here to tell you that you are not alone. You are not crazy. You are a woman, and you possess a remarkable strength and wisdom, that the world needs.

When women fully embrace and understand their innate power, you awaken a boundless energy to give back to the world. These qualities are beautiful + magnetic + transformative üôåüèº 
¬†
For over a decade, I've been working with women 1:1, hosting moon circles, retreats and gatherings. I've witnessed that women are inherently emotional, deeply sensitive, and cyclical beings. 

Our bodies naturally sync with the moon cycle, and when women come together, change takes place. In this safe and nurturing space, women can express their true selves, feel seen, heard, and held. 

This is why I am deeply passionate about leading my first women‚Äôs group program, Nourish Your Flow - 8 Week Course - starting October 28th. 

It's not just about understanding your body, loving it, and embracing its superpower‚Äîyour period. It's about the power of women gathering in a supportive group of environment. 

Where women can feel safe, share, connect, learn, grow, and ultimately be nourished.¬†

From this place, we can create change! 

I care so deeply about this work.

The countdown is on, I would love to have you join the brave women who are already signed up to join this journey. 

We are less than 2 weeks away - sign up links in my BIO ‚òùüèº 

I am sending my love, prayer and hope for everyone who is dealing with grief and hopelessness right now. You are not alone!¬†
¬†
All my love + light,

instagram,"I am guilty of doing this. I wasn't even aware of how much I did this until my husband moved out. In the last few weeks, my life has changed completely. I feel free. Suddenly I feel like myself again. I find myself repeating ""I wasn't allowed to do that"" or ""He wouldn't let me do that"". I am both shocked and saddened when I hear myself saying this. I had no idea how bad things had become. I had been lulled into this false sense of contentment and happiness by my trauma response of agreeing to everything my husband wanted. As long as he got his way he was the perfect husband. It was only after I started complaining about how things weren't working that he became angry and started fighting me. He is now furious with me for challenging his authority and for setting clear boundaries.

instagram,"Official Communication from AIESEC in Bahrain: Serving our mission with integrity

Dear AIESECers, partners, and supporters,

In AIESEC in Bahrain, our mission is clear: to develop the leadership potential of young people. We firmly believe that leadership is not merely a position or a title; it's a way of being. It's about positively impacting society, advocating for what's right, and standing up for one's beliefs. We stand in solidarity with the civilian victims in Palestine and call on young people around the world to educate themselves about the ongoing crisis and take a stand against human rights violations.

We stand with those who strive for a world where everyone is treated equitably and where every voice is heard. We believe that our role as value-driven leaders is to lead by example, uphold our values, and support what's right.

We stand against violence and aggression that endanger the safety and rights of the apartheid victims. We firmly believe that justice should prevail, and while we may not have the means to directly influence global conflicts, we can offer our support, compassion, and efforts to alleviate the suffering of those affected by speaking up for their rights.

"" Call to Action: We urge all members of AIESEC in the Bahrain community and all our stakeholders in the Bahraini society to join us in supporting the victims in Palestine. Let us heed the call from our government, make donations, and take actions that can make a real difference in the lives of those in need in Palestine. As Bahrainis, let us prioritize action and leadership in these challenging times, reaffirming our commitment to a better world for all.

In a world where division and conflict persist, we stand united in our mission to contribute to a more just, equitable, and just global community.

Their efforts earned us a pandemic which lead to over a million deaths in America alone. Right about now, according to the movies I've been watching; It, Clown, Spawn, Death Note, The Joker, clowns are demons interjecting themselves into our world to cause mischief and conflict.

instagram,"The primordial healing traditions of the world vary in many ways, but one core belief they all share is that everything inside of us possesses an energy or spiritual charge. Feelings of negativity aren't dismissed or coped with in these cultures; they are worked with and cleared, often through the ritualistic burning of herbs or plant resins.

If you feel stuck, stressed, overwhelmed, blocked, low energy, or laden with inner conflict in your life, this ancient method of clearing the air is definitely something to try.

Combining the right intentions with specific herbs can make for a powerful ritual.

Below, I‚Äôm going to share three shamanic ceremonial herbs that are perfect to use for space clearing and how best to use them all together.

1. Use Sage to clear

Sage is a wonderful purification herb that can be used in your home, workspace, automobile, or any other place you spend time in. I like to use sage, known by the scientific name Salvia officinalis, when I'm traveling to cleanse hotel rooms before I settle in.

We burn it after having guests over, to reset the space and send everyone's energies along with them. For anyone working in healing arts, sage is especially important to use after each session, to purify the healing environment between clients.

To start working with this herb, open a window or a door and then slowly walk through each room with a piece of burning sage, allowing the smoke to spread over all the surfaces. Try setting the intention of clearing, releasing, and letting go of anything that no longer serves you, or that doesn‚Äôt belong.

""I release attachment to anything that does not serve my highest and best self.""

‚ÄúI let go of any negative thoughts, worries, or any energy that does not...

instagram,"... cont. Thanks to those who have messaged telling us about some great conversations happening and plans to ease the mental load of many mammas.
Also, I know that many dads worry about their kids - of course they do! Statistics indicate though that women are more prone to anxious thinking than men. Some research has shown, too, that women are more likely to ruminate than men.
And, what I was pointing out to Kate in the Nova interview was not to say that women love their kids more than men. Or that worry makes a better parent... This is just a dynamic that commonly plays out in a lot of heterosexual relationships. And it can create conflict, which could be resolved with honest, real conversations.
This chat has obviously struck a chord about potential challenges for those practising ‚Äòteam parenting' and that's a good thing! Exploring how to be the dad you want to be - especially if you had an old school dad - is certainly something some of the dads I've interviewed for the @listnrau podcast, The Good Enough Dad, have been talking about. And I look forward to hearing more from them to keep this conversation going.

Edit: 

Just to clarify, when I referred to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I meant that my concern extends to both sides and it goes without saying that the Hammas attacks were horrific. Regardless of someone's religion, my primary focus is on the value of human life, and I feel immense sadness for ALL civilians affected. However, it is distressing to acknowledge that the current situation has resulted in the loss of over 1500 Palestinian childrens lives. I believe it is important to highlight the disparity in how these sides are perceived, with one receiving encouragement and funding from Western leaders while the other is labeled as terrorism. It is this  huge disparity that is uncomfortable.

In this media and political landscape where Israeli voices are amplified  we can provide the tiniest of voices for Palestinians who are facing genocide, whilst also mourning the horrendous loss of lives in Isreal.",,305,"{'like_count': 269, 'comment_count': 36, 'num_users': 10491}",Cedar Home Fragrance,,2023-10-18 06:53:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/105559890_290085145477657_6671526095670179078_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=aUiDy-b6pVoAX-VoUP4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBdCUNnH1fE_Mw8yW0RGipZF-QIsWBxDKMUyT1iTTdbFw&oe=655ADBD1,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyh-Ja2Lelq/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391365598_849051633429204_2226614898178583288_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=VTp7yjKdFCAAX8OVr7J&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDyPb2-b6AFiSq9-szM98vsnHB0F2ulV-wfCQDUp7rHAA&oe=65489F32

instagram,"Communist Party of SL expresses solidarity with Palestinians.

The Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL), issuing a statement, expressed what it calls ‚Äòunwavering solidarity‚Äô with the Palestinian people during this period of increased resistance to Israel's criminal occupation of Palestinian territory.

The statement said the CPSL places the full responsibility on the fascist right-wing government of Israel for the sharp and dangerous escalation that has resulted in many innocent civilians losing their lives.

""At the end of a shocking week in early October, in which the settlers ran amok throughout the occupied territories under the auspices of the Israeli government and incidents around the Al-Aqsa Mosque led to the very serious escalation.

‚ÄúThe deaths of civilians and crimes against them on both sides must be avoided and condemned. However, it must be clearly understood that horrific crimes are perpetrated against the Palestinian people on a daily basis by the Israeli military and state-backed settlers.

""The Communist Party of Sri Lanka strongly and unequivocally condemn the continued military bombardment on Gaza which has resulted in the killing of scores of Palestinian civilians and injuring of hundreds more including children.

Collective punishment of the people of Gaza is a war crime and must cease immediately. Israel‚Äôs brazen violation of international humanitarian law and international law has continued for decades now, with the full support of imperialist forces, and without any meaningful intervention to address the core issue of the conflict.

""The CPSL would like to emphasize that the core issue of the conflict will only be resolved by implementing the resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council.

Additionally, French Senator Val√©rie Boyer called for stripping Benzema of his French nationality, as well as his Ballon d'Or. 

‚ÄúWe cannot accept that a world-famous French binational can dishonor and even betray our country,‚Äù a statement from Boyer, the vice-president of the conservative Les R√©publicains party, read.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

Dear AIESECers, partners, and supporters,

In AIESEC in Bahrain, our mission is clear: to develop the leadership potential of young people. We firmly believe that leadership is not merely a position or a title; it's a way of being. It's about positively impacting society, advocating for what's right, and standing up for one's beliefs. We stand in solidarity with the civilian victims in Palestine and call on young people around the world to educate themselves about the ongoing crisis and take a stand against human rights violations.

We stand with those who strive for a world where everyone is treated equitably and where every voice is heard. We believe that our role as value-driven leaders is to lead by example, uphold our values, and support what's right.

We stand against violence and aggression that endanger the safety and rights of the apartheid victims. We firmly believe that justice should prevail, and while we may not have the means to directly influence global conflicts, we can offer our support, compassion, and efforts to alleviate the suffering of those affected by speaking up for their rights.

"" Call to Action: We urge all members of AIESEC in the Bahrain community and all our stakeholders in the Bahraini society to join us in supporting the victims in Palestine. Let us heed the call from our government, make donations, and take actions that can make a real difference in the lives of those in need in Palestine. As Bahrainis, let us prioritize action and leadership in these challenging times, reaffirming our commitment to a better world for all.

In a world where division and conflict persist, we stand united in our mission to contribute to a more just, equitable, and just global community.

No water, no safety, no food, no electricity. No one knows if they will live to see tomorrow. We reiterated our support for President Biden‚Äôs call for Israel to abide by international laws of war. Allow water, food and medicine through a humanitarian corridor and the opening of the Rafah border crossing (with guarantees for Palestinians that come out to ability to return). 
We asked for American leadership to join Arab countries and the international community to resolving the conflict helping to end the occupation and investing and rebuilding Gaza. What was cannot be no more. What was led to this horror. No one is safe. It‚Äôs not just Israeli or Palestinian problem. It‚Äôs an international crisis. 
I pray for the end of this war and terrified from what‚Äôs coming. Biden has a very good team in place. There must be an end game someone can articulate. 
In between meetings the Republican Party tried again to elect a speaker. The House cannot function. Republicans cannot govern.

instagram,"‚ÄúOne of our first learnings of the dynamic between man and elephant happened during our fieldwork in Palakkad, Kerala. We met a man who graciously took us through his fields and showed us his maize plants. Over hot tea and sweetcorn, he told us about the elephants he had seen, having lived on the land for longer than a decade. He explained that he felt deeply connected to the animal, and felt they were a majestic sight to behold. The farmer then took us to a railway track close to his house. Here, he explained that elephants often lose their lives, or face injury due to oncoming trains and collisions. He expressed his fondness for the animal, and sadness when hearing about their pain‚Äù.

Our Doctoral Fellow, Simran Prasad, shares an interesting story about her time in the field. Simran is currently working to understand the challenges that farmer‚Äôs face due to increasing elephant conflict incidents across the Western Ghats. If you want to support Simran‚Äôs work, please donate at the link in our bio to help her research solutions to aid people that face conflict. Thank you!

instagram,"BERLIN, 18 Oktober - Pemain bola sepak Belanda Anwar El-Ghazi digantung oleh kelabnya Mainz, kerana membuat hantaran di media sosial mengenai konflik Israel-Hamas.

Kelab Bundesliga Jerman itu menyifatkan tindakan El-Ghazi ""tidak boleh diterima kelab"" serta tidak ""sejajar dengan nilai-nilai kelab"".

Memetik laporan Al Jazeera, pemain bola sepak itu memuat naik ayat berbunyi 'Palestine will be free' (Palestin akan bebas).

Bagaimanapun, bekas pemain sayap Aston Villa, El Ghazi sudah memadam hantaran itu.

El-Ghazi, yang berasal dari Maghribi mewakili Belanda dua kali, menandatangani untuk Mainz pada akhir September.

El-Ghazi sebelum ini telah bermain untuk gergasi Belanda PSV Eindhoven dan Ajax, serta kelab Liga Perdana Aston Villa dan Everton.

Rakyat Palestin di Jerman, serta penyokong turut menerima sekatan dan tidak membenarkan mereka yang pro-Palestin untuk mengecam tindakan Israel dan membuat protes di negara itu.

""Mainz menghormati terdapat perspektif berbeza mengenai konflik Timur Tengah yang berlaku selama beberapa dekad,"" kata kelab itu dalam satu kenyataan yang disiarkan di Twitter.

MERCY Malaysia strongly condemns Israel's recent strike on Al-Ahli Baptist Arab Hospital in Gaza, which claimed the lives of 500 people. 

This reprehensible act not only resulted in the loss of innocent lives but also violated the fundamental principles of International Humanitarian Law. Hospitals, along with other medical facilities, must remain sanctuaries in times of conflict to provide life-saving medical care to those in need.

This is a stark reminder of the importance of adhering to the rules of war as outlined in the Geneva Conventions. Hospitals and healthcare workers should never be targeted, and those injured in conflict must have access to the medical care they need. MERCY Malaysia calls for an immediate end to any attacks on hospitals, medical personnel, and healthcare infrastructure.

MERCY Malaysia stands in solidarity with the people affected by the recent strike on the hospital in Gaza. We reiterate our call for the protection of hospitals in accordance with International Humanitarian Law and for an immediate end to attacks on healthcare facilities.

Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. Let us remember that wars should never be fought at the expense of innocent lives and the sanctity of hospitals. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that healthcare remains accessible and safe for all, regardless of the circumstances.

instagram,"While speaking in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Wednesday, President Joe Biden warned Israeli leadership not to be ‚Äúconsumed‚Äù by rage and to learn from the ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù made by the United States in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.

Biden‚Äôs Warning: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure those horrors have tapped into some kind of primal feeling in Israel just like it did in the United States,‚Äù Biden stated. ‚ÄúShock, pain, rage. An all-consuming rage.‚Äù Biden went on to say, ‚ÄúJustice must be done. But I caution this: While you feel that rage, don‚Äôt be consumed by it. After 9/11 we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.‚Äù

Bipartisan Regret: Biden‚Äôs warning comes the same day as the release of an AP-NORC poll, which concluded that a majority of both Democrats and Republicans believe America‚Äôs war in Afghanistan ‚Äî a war started in response to the 9/11 attacks ‚Äî was not worth fighting. Only 29% stated that the U.S. succeeded in ‚Äúeliminating the threat from Islamic extremists taking shelter in Afghanistan.‚Äù

Gaza Endgame: Echoing American frustration with the two-decade-long conflict in Afghanistan, Reuters (Center bias) is reporting that Israeli officials have ‚Äúno obvious endgame in sight, with no clear plan for how to govern the ravaged Palestinian enclave even if it triumphs on the battlefield.‚Äù Israeli officials reportedly ‚Äúdon't have a clear idea for what a post-war future might look like‚Äù for Gaza.

instagram,"BREAKING NEWS
United posted really good Q3 earnings last night but is getting hammered thanks to more pessimistic Q4 guidance from the airline. 

WHAT HAPPENED
For Q3, United experienced record revenue and profits thanks to low fuel costs and an explosion in international travel. United performed even better than the market expected, hitting $14.4 billion in revenue and a near 10% EPS beat of $3.65. But this market is forward-looking, so United's guidance is what investors really wanted to see. 

WHAT'S COMING NEXT
And United is expecting to get hammered from multiple angles. First up, they are being hit with much higher expected fuel costs than their competitors, expecting an 11% increase in costs from Q3 that will absolutely bulldoze their ability to profit. 

Meanwhile, United is one of the most exposed U.S. airlines to the ongoing conflict in Israel, with service to Tel Aviv from 3 airports in their coverage. If they keep flights paused, United expects a massive additional decline in EPS, all the way down to $1.50 a share potentially, With Wall Street expecting around $2.09 for Q4, that's a pretty massive deal in a moment where the crisis in Gaza only appears to be deepening. 

WHY IT MATTERS
After boosting profitability through a high-demand Q3, the easier days of summer are gone for airlines. Fuel costs have come roaring back and worldwide uncertainty can put a damper on international travel as well. This is causing a pretty big reversal for airlines right now after Q2 beats drove a wave of bull sentiment. While this won't break United, it can be a strong headwind for the top airline. The market is now much more concerned about weaker companies like American Airlines, which reports earnings tomorrow. While every airline faltered in early trading, United took the brunt of the selloff by dropping over 5% at market open.

instagram,"""The brazen one-sided account of the conflict justifying Israeli aggression against Palestinians living in the occupied Gaza Strip has exposed the mainstream Western media‚Äôs claims of objectivity in reporting. Truth has been a major casualty in the ongoing war.

While disproportionately highlighting the Hamas assault, the destruction of Gaza and the killing of thousands of Palestinians, mostly children in Israeli airstrikes, has received little coverage in the US and other Western media.

Israel‚Äôs war crimes are being justified on the pretext of the ‚Äòright to self-defence‚Äô. There is no word of protest on the killing of a dozen Arab journalists in the relentless bombing that has turned Gaza into rubble. The double standards of those who claim to be the champions of freedom and democracy is appalling.""

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Signatories include prominent Holocaust and genocide studies scholars.

‚ÄúAs scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies, we are compelled to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. We do not do so lightly, recognising the weight of this crime, but the gravity of the current situation demands it.‚Äù

instagram,"‚ÄúOver the past week and a half, as the Israeli-Hamas war has unfolded, I have watched in horror as my fears about hate speech and violence have begun to come true,‚Äù Anika Collier Navaroli writes in The Emancipator. In 2022, she blew the whistle about her warnings to Twitter that went unheeded leading to the January 6th attack on the Capitol and the platform‚Äôs ultimate decision to suspend former President Donald Trump. 

As the FBI warned of violent threats,  a six-year-old was targeted in a hate crime and stabbed 26 times by his landlord near Chicago for being Palestinian. Without serious enforcement of anti-hate speech policies on social media, this danger might only grow ‚Äî it has before.

In the 1900s, the first blockbuster movie, Birth of a Nation, romanticized racism and glorified racial violence. After the film was shown across the country, the KKK‚Äôs numbers only swelled, allowing the organization to spread beyond its Southern base, and setting the stage for the deaths of thousands of Black Americans.

In Rwanda, the private radio station Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM) was created in the early 1990s to incite violence against the Tutsi ethnic minority. It aired programs that called Tutsis ‚Äúcockroaches‚Äô' and ‚Äúsnakes,‚Äù and asked the Hutus, Rwanda‚Äôs ethnic and political majority, to ‚Äúexterminate‚Äù and ‚Äúcut down‚Äù the Tutsi people.  Almost a million Tutsis died during the conflict, and in 2003, an international court convicted three RTLM executives of genocide for their role in inciting violence through hate speech on the radio.

Most recently in 2022, Amnesty International research showed how hate speech on social media substantially contributed to the genocide of the predominantly Muslim Rohingya ethnic minority in Myanmar. Although hate speech was already prohibited by Facebook and Twitter, social media feeds in the country were flooded with posts calling the Rohingya ‚Äúinvaders‚Äù and ‚Äúdogs‚Äù that needed ‚Äúto be shot.‚Äù Nearly 10,000 Rohingya were killed and almost one million were forced to flee the country.

Over the last few days I have felt so overwhelmed by the conflict unfolding between Israel and Palestine. I honestly feel so overwhelmed with sadness. I didn‚Äôt feel it was right to be posting on my Instagram knowing what I know is happening in the world. I also feel so helpless and powerless to do anything to stop these things from happening. All I can do is speak out against civilians been killed on both sides. I also have jobs and businesses that I must support on my Instagram.

Sending love and support to all effected.

On 17th October, the 11th day of Israel's bombardments on the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel bombed the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, killing more than 500 people including patients, doctors & those seeking refuge.

Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians (1.1 million children) and is one of the world's most densely populated places. Israel has held it under siege for 17 years. In the last 11 days Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on the imprisoned population, estimated to be the equivalent force of a quarter of a nuclear bomb. Human rights experts have also confirmed the use of the internationally-banned weapon, white phosphorus.

On 15 October 2023, over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

The President was scheduled to travel to Jordan following a scheduled visit to Israel on Oct. 18.

""After consulting with King Abdullah II of Jordan and in light of the days of mourning announced by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, President Biden will postpone his travel to Jordan and the planned meeting with these two leaders and President Sisi of Egypt,"" the White House stated in a statement.

According to a senior White House official, the decision to cancel the meeting was ""mutual.""

Earlier today, hundreds of people were been confirmed dead in a strike on a Gaza City hospital. Hamas blamed an Israeli air strike, while Israel claims the hospital was hit by a rocket misfired by a radical Palestinian militant group.

""Immediately upon hearing this news [of the strike], I spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened,"" President Biden stated on X.

""The United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy.""

A Jordanian official reportedly told journalists from NBC News that all parties agreed to the cancellation. The official stated that the summit would not be able to achieve any goals under the current circumstances.

instagram,"I'm sure many of you have been burdened by the conflict in the Middle East as well as for the nation of Israel as we have. 

Since 2018, the Lord has knitted our hearts with Israel through key scriptural revelations from Isaiah 42, Romans 11, Isaiah 24. This gave us direction as a worship & missions ministry in raising up the Song of the Lord from the gentile nations to bring a Romans 11 provocation for Israel‚Äôs salvation. 

We had been planning the Isaiah 24 Project Israel experience with One King Ministries, to bring 100 worship singers and musicians from the nations to Israel. In light of the war, we have decided to postpone the trip to 2024. 

But the songwriting aspect of Isaiah 24 Project begins now. 

In Isaiah 24, the prophet predicted a day when the east and west would sing of the glory of God to Israel and the nations in a time of extreme crisis. We are now in a time of extreme crisis for Israel and the region. 

What is happening in Israel is a spiritual battle. His worshippers must release the song of the Lord in this hour. It is in worship that powers of darkness are defeated - just like how King Jehoshaphat‚Äôs battle was won through praise and worship! 

As a first step we are launching a Youtube channel to distribute music that is written with the heart and burden of Isaiah24. 

You can find the channel at: www.youtube.com/@Isaiah24Project

instagram,"(Toronto, ON) October 18, 2023 ‚Äì The Muslim Advisory Council of Canada (MACC) is deeply concerned about the sudden rise in Islamophobic incidents in various sectors across Canada, including healthcare. Over the past couple of weeks, several Islamophobic incidents have been directly reported to the Muslim Advisory Council of Canada by physicians, physicians‚Äô assistants, and patients seeking medical assistance in Canadian healthcare facilities. This, of course, is linked to the devastating events that have taken place, and continue to take place, in Israel and Palestine. Our heartfelt condolences are with both Israelis and Palestinians who have suffered unimaginable losses.

Unfortunately, yesterday, we learned of an attack on Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, resulting in the death of hundreds of civilians. In accordance with international law, hospitals and critical civilian infrastructure should not be targeted. Hospitals must be a safe haven for the injured. The
growing number of innocent civilians who have lost their lives in this conflict, including women and children, is an atrocity. As stated by Prime Minister Trudeau yesterday, ""International humanitarian and international law needs to be respected in this and in all cases. There are rules around wars and it's not acceptable to hit a hospital.""

No fighting or scuffle took place at the game. However, the organisers had to temporarily halt the game again, due to a quarrel between two actors. 

This time, the conflict is about two actors named Rabbi and Antu. The two have played in the corporate league before. So according to the rules they cannot play in the celebrity cricket league. Among them, Rabbi belongs to Salahuddin Lavlu's team while Antu is playing for Dipankar Dipon's team.

A story of resilience, hope, and determination, the film is based on the real-life Munshi family whose son, Sachin, was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

Bad journalism, lack of due diligence and words can make this conflict spread further out of control. We mourn the loss of life and just like the massacre in Israel and the deaths of those sheltering in the hospital, and future casualties of Gaza civilians being used as human shields, responsibility lies squarely with the terrorist organizations of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

A story of resilience, hope, and determination, the film is based on the real-life Munshi family whose son, Sachin, was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

instagram,"Couldn‚Äôt live comfortably in these recent days, but today‚Äôs news was too much to not spread the news, speak up, and create a post to sum up this common feeling. üáµüá∏ü§≤üèª

You definitely know what's happening right now in our temporary world. If you didn‚Äôt know before, somehow you started realizing that there are things that used to be covered up, distorted, and claimed as an excuse to do injustice.

For a long time ago, there‚Äôs neither war nor conflict in the Land of Olives (symbolized by green color in their flag). Instead, a colonialism, genocide, ethnic cleansing, massacre ‚Ä¶ you name it. Unfortunately, the world was blinded by major medias which tend to be in the money-and-power-source side. I hope the current situation can reveal the reality one by one. 

Not gonna talk about the resistance or condemnation (u know which is which!) bcs it‚Äôs been overwhelming. However, right in the night before Gaza Hospital blast, I had a conversation with an Indonesian friend living in Japan.

üí•N: I‚Äôm trying to target that video (slide 8) for my friends who are still neutral, even I know some Japaneses defending ISRL.
üí• ME: No wonder. Their media dragged the issues into H4M45.
üí• N: Honestly, I‚Äôm overwhelmed. Been logged out IG many times bcs I‚Äôm not strong enough. So sad, so annoyed.
üí• ME: Sometimes I think that the departed souls are lucky. The world has become very cruel‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm not ready to depart yet.
üí• N: RELATEEEE üò≠üò≠üò≠

See? That‚Äôs how it is when the mothers think too much about something. Overthinking is our middle name. We worry about our child's development, their achievement, their social life‚Ä¶ every day! Meanwhile, in PLSTN, a mother is just worried about how long she can continue to hold her child alive until she herself dies. There‚Äôs nothing more heartbreaking than this continuing strikes. üíîüíîüíî

That may give the impression that I was urgently reassigned to document the visiting POTUS as he held emergency meetings in secret war rooms but that would very much not be the case. What it did mean was that Tel Aviv ground to a standstill. The story I hoped to cover in the south had to be cancelled and the funeral I was aiming to attend was missed. Every avenue both creatively and literally was a roadblock.

With the world looking towards Israel to find out what would happen next following the horrific scenes from the hospital in Gaza, the families of the hostages taken by Hamas took to the streets outside the central military base to make their voices heard. Sticking posters to passing cars and tying yellow ribbons to all of the trees and pillars along the road, these friends and family members must be in such unbelievable turmoil as they think of what may now come. 

Among the photos and posters on display, one woman‚Äôs handwritten sign stood out in its message; ‚ÄúBring them home. No revenge.‚Äù

Maybe things have been going they way the need to, and maybe we need to realize that Rome wasn't built in a day, and that it won't be deconstructed in one either. 

Maybe we need to really support those who need help the most, in whatever ways each individual has the capacity to do, and not shun or try to outperform one another.

Maybe we begin to look at the human, the humanity, of each and every individual and cast everything else aside.

Maybe we will recognize the other, the symbolic order, hyper reality, and maybe we can live and let live, for now (or at least support people when inevitable conflict arises). 

Maybe great change will come from multiplicities of rhizomatic individuals deciding to change themselves before they try to change the whole world. 

Just Maybe.

instagram,"We are collectively witnessing genocide happen in real time. 

Yesterday Israeli government bombed a hospital. The Israeli government has been trying to conceal the wrong doing by spreading misinformation when they warned the physicians and nurses to evacuate 5 days prior to the bombing, then their own Israeli Digital Spokesperson tweeted the successful bombing then deleted his tweet after. This victim blaming/ gaslighting is another level of hate and they need to be held accountable for this catastrophe. Locals say aside from the medical workers and patients, innocent civilians have been taking shelter at the hospital because they have no where else to go and thought would be the safest. So it‚Äôs actually more than 500 people murdered. This is extremely atrocious and demonic. This isn‚Äôt even the first hospital they bombed. My heart has been breaking over and over again. 

‚ÄúDid you know that even wars have rules? The rules of war, also called International Humanitarian Law. IHL protects people who are not fighting like civilians and wounded or captured fighters. It ensures humane treatment and humanitarian assistance. IHL also restricts the weapons and tactics that fighters can use which helps to protect civilians and civilian objects like homes, schools, hospitals. Civilians are #notatarget.‚Äù ‚ÄúCivilians must be protected at all times. IHL must be respected and upheld‚Äù. - @unitednations Attacking civilians is a violation against IHL and a war crime. 

For those who still don‚Äôt know the full 75 year history of the conflict, you don‚Äôt need a PhD in this subject matter at this point. This collective punishment of 2.2 million civilians of Gaza for Hamas‚Äô act is wrong. This is the dire time now where your humanity, your moral compass should really speak for where you stand. Everyone MUST demand immediate ceasefire now. This must be stopped. 

Note: Commenting has been turned off to stop the spread of misinformation and gaslighting comments that defends this genocide. The confusion of how you want to keep defending the Israeli government‚Äôs ruthless actions that breaches on humanity makes me feel sick to my stomach.

‚Å†
In our latest article (link in bio), we explore three fundamental questions to ask before diving into a committed relationship.‚Å†
‚Å†
1. What Are Our Long-Term Goals? Love flourishes when you share similar visions for the future. It's essential to discuss your long-term goals, dreams, and aspirations. Do they align with yours? This alignment can be the cornerstone of a strong and enduring relationship.‚Å†
‚Å†
2. Are We Compatible in Values and Beliefs? Shared values and beliefs are the glue that holds a relationship together. Talk openly about your faith, morals, and principles. Do they harmonize with your partner's? This compatibility can help navigate challenges and celebrate shared values.‚Å†
‚Å†
3. How Do We Handle Conflict? Conflict is a natural part of any relationship. It's essential to understand how both of you approach and resolve conflicts. Healthy communication and conflict resolution strategies are essential for a thriving partnership.‚Å†

instagram,"The escalating conflict in Gaza, Palestine, has intensified the critical demand for medical supplies. Prior to the devastating strike on Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, an incident marked as not only the deadliest bombing in Gaza's history but possibly in Palestinian history, the region's medical infrastructure had sustained irreparable damage. Healthcare providers are operating under dire circumstances, grappling with restricted access to medical resources and an environment that hinders their ability to deliver timely and high-quality healthcare.

On 17 October 2023, MERCY Malaysia Palestinian Staff and volunteers in Gaza, Palestine distributed essential medicines to the Ministry of Health (MOH) as part of our ongoing efforts to address the pressing medical needs in the region.

MERCY Malaysia is monitoring the humanitarian needs and impact and looking at all possibilities to provide aid to support those in need of humanitarian assistance.

instagram,"Jordan is doing all it can to stop the conflict but will not become complicit in another expulsion of Palestinians from their homes, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said on Wednesday.

The Hashemite kingdom will treat any attempt to displace the Palestinians as ‚Äúa declaration of war,‚Äù Safadi vowed, as quoted by the outlet Roya News.

Amman will not allow ‚Äúa new catastrophe‚Äù nor will it let Israel ‚Äúshift the crisis created and exacerbated by the occupation to neighboring countries,‚Äù he added.",,157,"{'like_count': 146, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 7650}",Bulgarian_T34_85v2,,2023-10-18 21:04:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/401092391_242075111954757_6535896209820394327_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Ayk3WuOp3NMAX9O2ASa&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCL3miKdXIIj4EphbNxrrHXt0P5qLngvnBuvZQ0xXTLXg&oe=655B12F5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyjfiSkO36i/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392858295_1311596496130417_3499522846144226239_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EkgMUnxf-w4AX-uD5wD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAESVGEamfijTovM_FJHWwEmmVaz2gP6q6KY8mybsW2qg&oe=653C4D5E
