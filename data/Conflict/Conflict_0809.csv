facebook,"Photo: Henry Fisher Refreshment Saloon and California Candy Factory and Fancy Cake Bakery, 118 J St. in Sacramento c.1869 In the historical narrative of California's past, we find it divided into two distinct regions during the era of Spanish colonial rule, which lasted for several centuries. These regions were known as Baja California and Alta California, each holding its significance within the larger framework of New Spain, which later became Mexico. Baja California, the southern part, encompassed the Baja Peninsula and extended roughly up to modern-day San Diego, California. Beyond this point, Alta California began, stretching northward. The eastern and northern boundaries of Alta California remained rather vague during this time. Despite limited physical presence and settlements, the Spanish asserted their claims over a vast expanse that now constitutes the western United States. In the year 1821, Mexico achieved its independence from Spanish colonial rule. Initially, it emerged as the First Mexican Empire and later transformed into the Mexican Republic. In this context, Alta California transitioned from a province to a territory, with Monterey, California, as its territorial capital and a governor holding executive authority. The period following Mexico's independence from Spain was marked by political instability, characterized by approximately 40 changes in government for 27 years, with each government having a relatively short tenure of about 7.9 months on average. Tensions between the United States and Mexico escalated due to disputes over territorial boundaries, particularly involving the Republic of Texas. Matters worsened when Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845. A series of conflicts between U.S. and Mexican forces eventually led the United States Congress to declare war against Mexico on May 13, 1846, marking the commencement of the Mexican-American War. News of this conflict reached Alta California approximately a month later. The U.S. Navy received orders to assume control of all California ports in preparation for war. The Pacific Squadron deployed around 400 to 500 U.S. Marines and Navy sailors, poised for potential land actions. On August 13, 1846, a combined force consisting of U.S. Marines, Navy sailors, and elements of Fr√©mont's California Battalion, transported by the USS Cyane, entered and took control of Pueblo de Los Angeles. In September 1846, Mexico organized a campaign to resist the American incursion into Los Angeles from the previous month. Consequently, the outnumbered U.S. troops temporarily evacuated the city but recaptured it in early January 1847. After 1847, California was governed (albeit with considerable difficulty due to desertions) by a U.S. Army-appointed military governor, supported by a relatively small force of just over 600 troops. By 1850, California's population had swelled to over 100,000, thanks to the influx of non-Indian and non-Californio (Spanish and Mexican settler) residents drawn by the California Gold Rush. As part of the Compromise of 1850, Congress passed the California Statehood Act on September 9, 1850, granting California official statehood status. The California Gold Rush attracted individuals from diverse countries, backgrounds, social classes, and races, with the majority being young men. Women, although few, found unique opportunities to engage in various activities and assume new roles. These adventurers, often called Argonauts, embarked on journeys to California, either by traversing the California Trail or arriving by sea. In 1849 alone, around 80,000 Argonauts made their way to California, with approximately 40,000 traveling overland and the remainder coming by sea. The need for essential supplies in the goldfields drove the development of transportation networks. Large freight wagons, drawn by teams of up to 10 mules, facilitated the delivery of crucial provisions such as firewood, lumber, food, equipment, clothing, mail, and packages to the miners. The demand for meat, particularly beef, soared during this period, causing cattle prices to surge from $1.00 to $2.00 per hide to an astounding $30.00-$50.00 per cow. The dawn of California's railroad era commenced in February 1855 with the construction of the first railway line connecting Sacramento to Folsom, California. This 22-mile (35 km) line aimed to capitalize on the prosperous gold mining activities in Placerville, California, although its completion coincided with the decline of mining in that area in February 1856. Between 1860 and 1903, a succession of railroad mergers and acquisitions reshaped California's transportation landscape. These developments culminated in the emergence of four major interstate railroads that served the state: the Southern Pacific Railroad, Union Pacific Railroad, Santa Fe Railroad, and Western Pacific Railroad.

facebook,"‚ÄúMajesty Surfacing‚Äù / Brown bears are generally solitary creatures, but when fall comes, and the salmon return to the Yukon's rivers, these nomads are forced to crowd into close proximity. Each one has their preferred fishing technique: some are divers, some pounce, others charge up the middle of the river, and some wait stealthily on rocks. In the case of Morris the bear, his preferred method was to ‚Äúsnorkel‚Äù with his face submerged in the river and his ears free to detect potential threats. Tensions can run high as the bears all vie for the best fishing spots. Keeping an ear out for any unruly neighbors while pursuing salmon is a clever way to avoid conflict. However, as threats like runoff, development, and disease from local salmon farms undermine the future of the once-abundant fish, bears like Morris will have an even harder time surviving. In order to safeguard Canada‚Äôs wildlife and its fragile ecosystems, we must protect wild salmon. Visit the link below to sign up for my newsletter and read more of my favourite wildlife encounters, including the story of how Morris and I met. https://bit.ly/FieldNotesSignUp:=:https://paulnicklen.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=8d9dedf8133b767d79460f0d1&id=4bbc87df9d Please note* Cristina, SeaLegacy, and I will NEVER direct message you, ask you to inbox me, or ask for your personal information under any circumstances.

She had been fatally speared ‚Äî yet another victim of human-wildlife conflict that plagues this area. Given that she was still producing milk, she had clearly given birth fairly recently.

facebook,"National Security expert Maj. General (ret.) Giora Eiland said Gaza has become a de facto state and so the conflict that is taking place is between the State of Gaza and State of Israel. Speaking to journalists during an online briefing sponsored by Media Central, Eiland said Israel would take the measures it needs to take to win the war. Among them he said Israel would stop all supplies to the Gaza Strip. That includes the electricity, water, fuel, and food it supplies or allows to pass through the Israeli border. Eiland noted that no country would continue to supply an enemy who is attacking it.

facebook,"In 2014, Bini and I were living in Israel when we found ourselves under rocket attacks from the Palestinian territories. As a young bunny owner, with only a few seconds to take cover in the stairwell, I had to quickly scoop up Bini and place him in his carry bag, waiting for the siren to stop. Many questioned why I would risk my life for a ""bunny,"" but I couldn't imagine any scenario where I'd leave him behind. I was hesitant to share this back then because of potential negative comments and individuals who might not understand the conflict. However, recent events serve as a stark reminder of the brutality the other side is capable of; they show no regard for civilians, children, or animals. If you truly want to learn more about my story, please message me privately.

facebook,"@visitscotlandtours Jedburgh Abbey. The Scottish Borders. Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø Jedburgh is one of the four great abbeys established in the Scottish Borders in the 1100s. David I founded a priory here in 1138 and raised it to abbey status in 1154. The brethren may have come here from St Quentin Abbey, near Beauvais, France. Augustinians were priests who for the most part lived a secluded and contemplative life, but also went forth to minister to the people. Monastic life was largely routine. But the abbey‚Äôs border location meant it was caught up in the conflict between Scotland and England in the later Middle Ages. The canons had to evacuate the premises during the Wars of Independence in the 1300s. beautifuldestinations #mustvisit #scotlandtravel #scotlandexplore #scotlandhighlands #scottishhighlands #highlands #edinburgh #stirling #glasgow #isleofskye #inverness #vacation #vacations #vacationmode #outlander #outlanderfans #clan #castle #castles #tour #tourguide #kilt",,3144,"{'like_count': 2595, 'comment_count': 72, 'num_users': 131452}",Visit Scotland Tours,,2023-10-08 16:37:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292493509_462124212583936_8390874272736941210_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EAhi7CVoHCQAX92Ao20&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCxgW2EkZ9IgGNyR-RT8IbclVlMix8LpGHJ3MY826VZLQ&oe=655ABF36,https://www.facebook.com/100063590821566/posts/818297313633289,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386100117_18391615495018216_3407300581795388560_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XuvC7cEqofIAX8IiuM6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAW7YIqGKDXMR1QCe9OMERQlTegq0v62ZyulUg55VGn2w&oe=655A1D55

facebook,"Just an update: As most of you know I'm on a cruise ship with 450+ United Methodists from across the US. We were to be in Israel today, tomorrow and Tuesday. The conflict forced the ship to be re-routed to Cyprus. We'll be on Cyprus tomorrow and then we were scheduled to be in Alexandria, Egypt tomorrow night and for the next three days. Today two Israeli tourists and their Egyptian guide were shot and killed in Alexandria. Due to concern that other events like this might happen - our visit to Alexandria was cancelled this evening. We will instead be traveling back to the Aegean, visiting Pauline sites including Ephesus, Miletus, Athens and Corinth plus three other Greek islands. Everyone is safe. The cruise ship and Educational Opportunities are making excellent decisions, there is disappointment that the plans to visit Israel and Egypt will not happen, but even greater concern for the people who have been killed, injured or abducted in Israel, and Palestinians who will be injured or killed by the tragic actions of the leaders of Hamas. The actions of Hamas do nothing but harm the cause of Palestinians while killing and injuring Israeli civilians. Please pray for the leaders in Israel and Palestine, and for the people who are caught in a seemingly inescapable cycle of violence and conflict. As a sign that our folks are doing fine, a number of us are sitting down to watch the Chiefs game here on the ship - it begins at 11:25 p.m. - just an hour and a half from now.",,2746,"{'like_count': 672, 'comment_count': 349, 'num_users': 66370}",Adam Hamilton,,2023-10-08 19:00:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/349523174_1229050644291684_7520797097809121968_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=zHcpbDShSuQAX8SJYeS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAKxjA4mRsK1Zor7FYFygZ7KyqYx3JpmU-WzvW-R_11ng&oe=655B5A76,https://www.facebook.com/100044155433418/posts/865360914945748,

facebook,"Wooden Leg: A Warrior Who Fought Custer is a 1931 book by Thomas Bailey Marquis about the life of a Northern Cheyenne Indian, Wooden Leg, who fought in several historic battles between United States forces and the Plains Indians, including the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where he faced the troops of George Armstrong Custer. The book is of great value to historians, not only for its eyewitness accounts of battles, but also for its detailed description of the way of life of 19th-century Plains Indians. The book was dictated to Marquis by Wooden Leg in Plains Indian Sign Language, their only common language. Marquis gathered the stories for the book from Wooden Leg and others while he was physician at the agency in Montana from 1922. They were reluctant to open up to him at first, but eventually Marquis gained their trust. Wooden Leg lived through some of the most turbulent times in Cheyenne history, but the book begins with his childhood and descriptions of Cheyenne customs. These include tribal organisation, the warrior societies, sport, religion and mythology, their friendship and cooperation with the Sioux, arrow recognition, warbonnet entitlement, and much more. Wooden Leg was introduced to warfare at a very young age via conflict with the Crow and joined the Elk warrior society at age 14. The book describes Wooden Leg's participation in the important battles of the war of 1876‚Äì1877, when the Cheyenne, Sioux, and other plains tribes fought the United States. These included not only the Little Big Horn, but the preceding Battle of the Rosebud and the succeeding Dull Knife Fight. Following the Cheyenne surrender, the tribe was deported to Oklahoma, but eventually Wooden Leg was allowed to return. At Fort Keogh he worked as a scout for the army and was later appointed a judge at the Tongue River Indian Reservation. Wooden Leg describes in detail how he befriended the old chief Little Wolf towards the end of the latter's life.

facebook,"Hamas's attack and the events unfolding since yesterday are unspeakable. We are heartbroken to watch terrified civilians besieged in their homes, innocent people murdered in cold blood on the streets, at parties, and at home. Dozens taken hostage and dragged into the Gaza Strip. Every one of us knows someone who has been tragically affected. We could go on and on about their cruel and criminal actions, or focus on how our Jewish-supremacist government brought us to this point. But as hard as it is, our job as former Israeli soldiers is to talk about what we were sent to do. Israel's security policy, for decades now, has been to ‚Äúmanage the conflict‚Äù. Successive Israeli governments insist on round after round of violence as if any of it will make a difference. They talk about ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù, ‚Äúdeterrence‚Äù, ‚Äúchanging the equation‚Äù. All of these are code words for bombing the Gaza Strip to a pulp, always justified as targeting terrorists, yet always with heavy civilian casualties. In between these rounds of violence we make life impossible for Gazans, and then act surprised when it all boils over. We talk about ""normalization"" with the UAE and now Saudi Arabia, while hoping the world will turn a blind eye to the open-air prison we built in our backyard. Apart from the unfathomable violation of human rights, we've created a massive security liability for our own citizens. The question Israelis are all asking is - where were the soldiers yesterday? Why was the IDF seemingly absent while hundreds of Israelis were slaughtered in their homes and on the streets? The unfortunate truth is that they were ‚Äúpreoccupied‚Äù. In the West Bank. We send soldiers to secure settler incursions into the Palestinian city of Nablus, to chase Palestinian children in Hebron, to protect settlers as they carry out pogroms. Settlers demand that Palestinian flags are removed from the streets of Huwara; soldiers are sent to do it. Our country decided - decades ago - that it's willing to forfeit the security of its citizens in our towns and cities, in favor of maintaining control over an occupied civilian population of millions, all for the sake of a settler-messianic agenda. The idea that we can ""manage the conflict"" without ever having to solve it is once again collapsing before our eyes. It held up until now because only few dared to challenge it. These heartbreaking events could change that. They must.

facebook,"On this date in 1973, CHER began a two week run at No.1 on the US singles chart with HALF-BREED, her second US No.1 (Oct 8, 1973) ""My father married a pure Cherokee My mother's people were ashamed of me The Indians said I was white by law The White Man always called me ""Indian Squaw"""" In her second chart-topping hit (after ""Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves""), Cher sings from the perspective of a mixed-race woman who grew up as an outcast because she was a ""half-breed."" Because she was only part Caucasian and part Native American, she wasn't accepted by either race and found herself looking for validation in dead-end relationships with men. Cher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in El Centro, California, to an Armenian American father and an Arkansas-born mother with English, German, Irish, French, and Dutch ancestry. Around the time ""Half-Breed"" was released, Cher claimed she was also 1/16th Cherokee on her mother's side. Snuff Garrett produced the song despite his intention to quit working with Sonny and Cher. He had been battling Sonny, the singer's then-husband, over what type of material she should be singing. Lyricist Mary Dean wasn't aware of the conflict when she brought ""Half-Breed"" to Garrett, a song she wrote with Al Capps specifically for Cher. Garrett recalled in a 1973 Rolling Stone interview: ""I said from the lyrics it's a smash for Cher and for nobody else... And I didn't even have Cher at the time. To me, nobody else could do that song but Cher - that was Cher's story. So I held the song and then it worked out that we got Cher back, but the song sat in my desk for about three, four months."" Cher is backed my session musicians from LA's famous Wrecking Crew, including Hal Blaine on drums.

facebook,"Prayer to Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary

O Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, in these times of such brazen impiety, manifest thy power with the signs of thine ancient victories.

From thy throne whence thou dispense pardon and grace, mercifully regard the Church of thy Son, His Vicar on Earth, and every order of clergy, religious, and laity, who are oppressed in this mighty conflict.

Thou who art powerful, the vanquisher of all heresies, hasten the hour of mercy, even though the hour of God‚Äôs justice is every day provoked by the countless sins of men, the sons and daughters of Adam.

Obtain for me, the least of men, kneeling before thee in supplication, the grace I need to live righteously upon earth, in order to be numbered among the just in heaven.

In the company of all faithful Christians throughout the world, I salute thee and acclaim thee as Queen of the Most Holy Rosary.

facebook,"De beelden zijn vreselijk... Als reactie op de aanval die Hamas gisteren vanuit Gaza lanceerde, ontketent het Isra√´lische leger een zoveelste keer zijn vuurkracht. De regio staat eens te meer in lichterlaaie en voor de komende uren en dagen moet het ergste worden gevreesd. Onze gedachten gaan uit naar alle onschuldige burgerslachtoffers, aan beide kanten. Maar laten we duidelijk zijn: de oorlog die Benjamin Netanyahu en zijn regering vandaag zeggen uit te roepen tegen de Palestijnen, is al meer dan 75 jaar geleden begonnen. Aan de basis van het probleem liggen de Isra√´lische apartheid en bezetting, het onrecht en het dagelijkse geweld dat al die tijd al straffeloos wordt gepleegd. ‚ÄúDe onwettelijkheden worden in de eerste plaats gepleegd door Isra√´l, dat al 16 jaar een militaire blokkade in stand houdt, wat volgens het internationaal recht gelijk staat aan agressie. Meer in het algemeen is er de bezetting van de Palestijnse gebieden, met een kolonisatie die alleen maar toeneemt, met een hele reeks repressieve maatregelen tegen de Palestijnse bevolking, waaronder de vernieling van huizen‚Äù, legde Fran√ßois Dubuisson, professor internationaal recht aan de ULB, gisteren terecht uit op de RTBF. De toestand verslechtert nog met de huidige Isra√´lische regering, die bestaat uit extreemrechtse krachten. Dat toonden de gebeurtenissen van het voorbije jaar duidelijk aan: de invallen in de heilige plaatsen van de Al-Aqsa-moskee, de toenemende kolonisatie, met name van Sheikh Jarrah (Oost-Jeruzalem), de 247 Palestijnse doden sinds het begin van het jaar (v√≥√≥r dit weekend), de moord op journaliste Shireen Abu Akleh, de herhaalde aanvallen van Isra√´lische kolonisten op het dorp Huwara en de aanval op het vluchtelingenkamp van Jenin. Op 28 augustus publiceerde de ngo Human Rights Watch een alarmerend rapport waarin die het recordaantal Palestijnse kinderen die straffeloos worden gedood door de Isra√´lische bezettingstroepen, scherp veroordeelt. De Isra√´lische premier Benjamin Netanyahu verklaart nu: ‚ÄúWe gaan Gaza in een woestijn veranderen. Ik zeg tegen alle inwoners van Gaza dat ze moeten vluchten.‚Äù Maar waar moeten ze heen als ze al 16 jaar opgesloten zitten in een openluchtgevangenis van maar een paar vierkante kilometer? Niemand kan de situatie begrijpen of een oplossing voorstellen zonder deze realiteit in acht te nemen. Ook de steun van de Verenigde Staten en van Europese landen aan Isra√´l vormt een deel van het probleem. In plaats van Netanyahu te steunen in zijn oorlog, moeten we oproepen tot een onmiddellijk staakt-het-vuren en een dringende de-escalatie. Zeker omdat het conflict zich dreigt uit te breiden over de hele regio. Er moet een uitweg komen aan deze tragische spiraal van geweld: de bezetting be√´indigen is de enige manier om tot een rechtvaardige en duurzame vrede te komen.",,1844,"{'like_count': 601, 'comment_count': 344, 'num_users': 40965}",Raoul Hedebouw - PVDA,,2023-10-08 11:02:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/380882663_861844151964493_1479794957880788649_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=f5XaHgK0f48AX_fXAk6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBnNE2tQF0eDgG-dVs-KBPkjs3UNhCq9jVU0j2dhnOoqw&oe=655B6C3B,https://www.facebook.com/100044167492730/posts/871880010960907,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387757900_871879984294243_7687233800275904269_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=TcibPRtPoLgAX-fzLBn&_nc_oc=AQnwpBe5TB4YTadFTs9Oj_HT4XeBPPTDYURxhGKf4Vmd6FciUTbt3bdNURexgyPDBJU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBuDRyXKjJHS8n_K3JEWAwP0c_4PyarokPRdDjREk79KQ&oe=655AEE2B

facebook,"By now, you are all aware of the recent devastating escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian ‚Äòconflict‚Äô. Fingers are being pointed and statements of solidarity are being shared by various governments and individuals. I also have something to say. First, as a doctor, I absolutely despise any senseless loss of life to violence and war. Wars do not determine who is ‚Äòright‚Äô. They determine who is left. But we cannot, and must not, be blind when it comes to understanding how this situation has arisen. The events of the past 24hrs have been framed as an ‚Äòunprovoked‚Äô attack. But this is not factual. It‚Äôs fuelled by the continued occupation of Palestinian land, deemed illegal under international law, and declaring part of that land as your capital city. It‚Äôs fuelled by the continued settler expansion, deemed illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention. It‚Äôs fuelled by the desecration of Muslim and Christian holy sites during their holiest of celebrations. It‚Äôs fuelled by the military checkpoints that humiliate and subjugate. It‚Äôs fuelled by forced removals from homes and property, which is then handed over to the occupiers to inhabit. It‚Äôs fuelled by ‚Äòincursions‚Äô into sovereign Palestinian territory to arbitrarily arrest young men and minor children, and by convictions obtained by forced confessions under torture. It‚Äôs fuelled by the assassination of journalists like Shireen Abu Akleh, and then the harassment of her mourners at her funeral cort√®ge. It‚Äôs fuelled by an unjust legal system that consistently rules in favour of the occupying entity and imprisons, dispossesses and punishes Palestinians. It‚Äôs fuelled by an occupier that has literally imprisoned two million people in an open air refugee camp and controls how much water, electricity and aid can enter their territory. It‚Äôs fuelled by an apartheid system that treats Palestinians as second class citizens. It‚Äôs fuelled by a government that engages in provocative actions like filling in the water wells of Palestinians and evicting them from their homes. If you think that what you are seeing today is ‚Äòunprovoked‚Äô then you haven‚Äôt been watching what has been happening to Palestinians for the past 70 years. If the above isn‚Äôt the definition of provocation, then what is? All life is sacred. Human and animal. Muslim, Christian and Jew. Palestinian and Israeli. But I‚Äôm not willing to ignore all the factors at play which have lead to this critical point and pretend that Israel hasn‚Äôt breached dozens of UN Resolutions. I‚Äôm not willing to pretend that its current occupation of Palestinian Territories isn‚Äôt illegal under international law. I have no doubt that this war will escalate and a lot of innocent people will suffer. As usual, it‚Äôs women and children who will bear the brunt of this escalation. That‚Äôs why we, as the international community, need to demand that our governments do more than just offer platitudes, and that they actually work to bring about lasting peace through a two-state solution, the right of return, and recognition of East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. Anything else is just lip service and hypocrisy. - Sara Photo caption: the funeral cort√®ge of Palestinian Aljazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, murdered by Israeli snipers, harrassed by the same murderous forces who killed her.

facebook,"NATIVE AMERICANS ‚Äì THE FIRST OWNERS OF AMERICA Native Americans, or the indigenous peoples of the Americas, are the pre-Columbian inhabitants of North and South America and their descendants. Those who live within the boundaries of the present-day United States are composed of numerous, distinct tribes, bands and ethnic groups, many of which survive as intact, sovereign nations. Most authorities agree that the first evidence of people inhabiting North America indicates that they migrated here from Eurasia over 13,000 years ago, most likely crossing along the Bering Land Bridge, which was in existence during the Ice Age. However, some historians believe that people had migrated into the Americas much earlier, up to 40,000 years ago. These early Paleo-Indians spread throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes. Application of the term ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. However, there is considerable evidence in support of successful explorations which led to Norse settlement of Greenland, the L‚ÄôAnse aux Meadows settlement in Newfoundland, and potentially others some 500 years prior to Columbus landing in the Bahamas. From the Native American aspect, many tribes‚Äô oral histories indicate they have been living here since their genesis, as described by a wide range of creation myths. By the time European adventurers arrived in the 15th century, scholars estimate that more than 50 million people were already living in the Americas. Of these, some 10 million lived in the region that would later become the United States. As time passed, these migrants and their descendants pushed south and east, adapting as they went. With these new arrivals came centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies. Today, Native Americans account for about 1.5 percent of the United States population, many of whom continue to take pride in their ancestral traditions ‚Äî still practicing the music, art, and ceremonies that took place many years ago.

facebook,"When people are brutalised, denied basic human rights, thrown out of the homes they have lived in for generations and shoved in camps while the world stands by and does nothing, offering them no future - and in the case of those offered lives elsewhere, often literally no way out - they will eventually come to the conclusion that they have nothing to lose and support those, however hideous their ideology, who offer resistance. The Hamas attack would never have happened if the international community had not ignored the plight of the Palestinian people for decades. Now it has, it is incumbent on the world to find a lasting settlement based on a two-state solution. The response from Fatah this morning: ‚ÄòWe have repeatedly warned against the consequences of blocking the political horizon and failing to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate right to self-determination.‚Äô For me, a self evident truth, expressed responsibly as a call for a final settlement. As far as I know Fatah still want a two state solution on 1967 borders and that seems only way forward to me. And the fact that Fatah have not called on their militants to join the uprising suggests to me that even now there is a chance for negotiation to bring this nightmare to a swift end. But it must end with justice for the Palestinians. It‚Äôs a tragedy of history that Hamas was originally tolerated - and some say funded - to split the secular-socialist Palestinian movement as part of the wider Western ‚Äòanticommunist‚Äô strategy of the late Eighties. Because only leftist secularism can provide a solution to the conflict.

So serene and quiet. The Hitmen were invaded in their territory which was like a taboo and if the Alphas are to escape alive,that was a slap to their faces. They won't let that happen. Gunshots echoed through the once serene and quiet Drake Passage as the intense fight between the Alphas and the Hitmen unfolded. The air crackled with the fury and resentment of the Hitmen, provoked by the audacity of the Alphas who had dared to invade their territory. Taking cover behind sturdy pillars within the pyramid, the Alphas fought back, their shots ringing out from their concealed positions. The clash of gunfire intensified, filling the air with an eerie symphony of violence. The ground became littered with lifeless bodies, a grim testament to the unyielding brutality of the battle. Amidst the chaos, the pyramids became a battleground suffused with an overwhelming sense of tension. The atmosphere itself seemed to tremble with the weight of impending doom. Groaning sounds and the gnashing of teeth added a haunting backdrop to the relentless exchange of gunfire. As the fight raged on, the Hitmen found themselves slowly losing ground. The relentless onslaught from the Alphas began to take its toll, wearing down their resolve. Their initial anger transformed into desperation as they struggled to hold their own against the invading force. ""Damn this Alphas! Our men are almost finished !"" The once confident Hitmen now appeared vulnerable, their ranks thinning with every passing moment. The tide of the battle had shifted, and it seemed that victory was slipping further from their grasp. The Alphas, fueled by their determination and driven by a sense of purpose, pressed forward with unyielding force. The goal was to kill and destroy!! With each passing second, the intensity of the conflict heightened. The Alphas, emboldened by their early successes, pushed forward with unwavering resolve, seizing every opportunity to gain the upper hand. The Hitmen, battered and weary, fought on, their determination to protect their territory and maintain their dominance refusing to waver. Twenty five took control of the fight as he hinted to his men behind the pillars to lower their head. They immediately complied as they lower their faces and tightened theirselves. Amidst the chaos and destruction, the outcome of the battle remained uncertain. The air was thick with smoke, obscuring the vision of both sides as they waged their war. The clash of bullets and cries of pain merged into a dissonant symphony that echoed through the pyramid, a testament to the relentless struggle for power and control. In this moment of violent confrontation, the fate of the passage hung in the balance. The Alphas and the Hitmen were locked in a fierce struggle, each side driven by their own motivations and grievances. As the fight raged on, the outcome would be decided by the relentless determination and sheer willpower of those engaged in this desperate clash. In the midst of the chaotic battle, a sudden sound reverberated through the air. It was the distinct clatter of a small metal object hitting the ground, jolting the weary Hitmen who had gathered there, all over the age of forty. The noise cut through the frenzy, capturing their attention and shattering their focus. As they turned towards the source of the sound, their eyes widened in alarm. It was Twenty Five, a cunning member of the Alpha, who had dropped a bomb in close proximity to their hidden location. Realization washed over the faces of the Hitmen, their expressions turning pale with dread. They understood the imminent danger that loomed before them, but it was too late to escape the blast radius. Panic set in as they scrambled to find cover, but time betrayed them, ticking away mercilessly. In an instant, the bomb detonated with a resounding explosion, ripping through the air and wreaking havoc upon the Hitmen's position. The force of the blast sent shockwaves tearing through the area, shaking the very foundations of their hiding spot. The impact was devastating. The explosion claimed the lives of many Hitmen, their fate sealed in that unforgiving moment. The fierce heat and shrapnel tore through the air, inflicting unimaginable damage upon those unfortunate enough to be caught within its reach. Yet, amidst the chaos and destruction, some managed to survive. Fortune had favored those who were situated farther away from the epicenter of the blast. They escaped the full brunt of the explosion, though not unscathed. Survivors staggered from the wreckage, their bodies battered and their spirits shaken. The scene was one of carnage and despair, with the injured groaning in pain and the fallen lying (truncated)",,1273,"{'like_count': 1008, 'comment_count': 121, 'num_users': 15604}",S√ñ√õ≈Å R√àAD√äRS Lƒ™BR√ÇR≈∏ { Reading Rabbits},,2023-10-08 06:22:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386250046_283661901209869_3113430328469071027_n.jpg?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=aNZQmvh5Vl0AX_jdH9L&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAjYAuwBayk6-deYTzDTwg4oiEcXZIorGKPnz-HjP5rVg&oe=655B02D1,https://www.facebook.com/groups/928692818147184/permalink/1031072534575878,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387214505_286270794282313_3513744774275615344_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Nvlwb_aQs2oAX_hW9Ih&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAmG8jj-EcOYuSVMugRK9mpKKbyBvyR22I92nrWFXFYwg&oe=653EC4D1

facebook,"‚ÄúForgiveness‚Äù Once upon a time, in a hidden glen deep within an ancient forest, there lived a faerie named Abbie. Abbie was unlike the other faeries; she possessed a unique power that had been a mystery to her for as long as she could remember. She had the ability to forgive. In the faerie realm, forgiveness was a rare and powerful gift. Most faeries held onto grudges and slights, cherishing them like prized possessions. But not Abbie. She had a heart full of compassion and understanding, and she believed in the power of forgiveness to heal even the deepest wounds. One day, a great dispute erupted in the faerie community. It started as a simple argument between two families over the ownership of a magnificent crystal that was said to grant its possessor immense power. As the dispute escalated, it threatened to tear the entire glen apart. Abbie watched in dismay as her fellow faeries grew more and more consumed by anger and bitterness. She knew she had to do something to bring peace to her beloved home. With her gentle demeanor and kind heart, she approached the leaders of both families and offered to help mediate their conflict. At first, the feuding faeries were skeptical. They had never heard of forgiveness as a means of resolving disputes. But Abbie spoke to them about the healing power of letting go of anger and resentment. She shared stories of how forgiveness had transformed the lives of humans in the world beyond the forest. Slowly, the faeries began to listen. Abbie‚Äôs words touched their hearts, and they started to see the wisdom in her approach. She encouraged them to open their hearts to forgiveness, to release the burdens of anger and hatred they had been carrying for so long. It wasn‚Äôt an easy journey, but Abbie was there every step of the way, offering support and guidance. Over time, the feuding faeries began to forgive each other, and a remarkable transformation took place. The crystal, once a symbol of power and division, lost its luster and faded into obscurity. As the glen filled with the harmonious laughter of faeries who had once been bitter enemies, Abbie realized the true power of forgiveness. It wasn‚Äôt just about ending conflicts; it was about healing hearts, restoring relationships, and bringing about a profound sense of peace. Abbie‚Äôs unique gift had not only saved her home but had also shown her fellow faeries the incredible strength that lay in forgiveness. From that day forward, Abbie became known as the faerie of forgiveness, and her wisdom was sought by all who wished to mend their broken bonds. In the heart of the ancient forest, a lesson had been learned, and the power of forgiveness continued to shine as a beacon of hope and love, lighting the way for faeries and creatures of all kinds to find their own path to reconciliation and peace.",,1130,"{'like_count': 645, 'comment_count': 28, 'num_users': 39355}",Fairytails,,2023-10-08 12:57:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/304937072_122423797227117_6031807070512044882_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xF3gI0p3TQQAX8BTs6a&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAw8w9voOgJzlMcBcHNoZMpN7jhnboa_MjtP6GjiC7N4w&oe=6559D244,https://www.facebook.com/100083784900507/posts/289441130525382,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387739366_289441100525385_4863303905121261754_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YaBZaEgw1aIAX8ObuhS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCfSMqc6fBUlSK1IwFHWSHtO8hXIDe9zCBlk8CA6Vj3og&oe=65306D57

However, to the surprise of the Hitmen, Twenty Five and three other men suddenly broke away from the fleeing group. The men wore cold expressions, their eyes filled with unyielding determination as they turned to face the oncoming Hitmen. Caught off guard, the Hitmen froze in their tracks, their confusion evident. One of them couldn't help but utter an exclamation of bewilderment, ""Eh?!"" Their perplexity deepened as they observed Twelve, their gaze shifting to Twenty Five, who nodded in silent agreement. Without warning, the quartet launched a coordinated attack on the stunned Hitmen. The sudden assault caught the remaining Hitmen off balance, their reflexes dulled by the unexpected turn of events. The clash was fierce, as blows were exchanged and the air crackled with the energy of the confrontation. Twelve, a seasoned warrior, narrowed his gaze at the older men before him, his face etched with determination. He knew the stakes were high. The Alphas had already suffered losses at the hands of the Hitmen, fueling their resolve to eradicate their adversaries once and for all. The memory of fallen comrades propelled them forward, lending a relentless edge to their onslaught. The battle continued wit h an unyielding fervor. The Alphas fought with a ferocity born from a desire for vengeance and the protection of their own. The Hitmen, though caught off guard, were not without their own skills and experience. They fought back, their determination unwavering despite the sudden shift in the tide of the conflict. Within the confines of the pyramid, the clash of bodies and the clash of wills reverberated, each strike carrying the weight of past grievances and future aspirations. The alphas who had run out were all stationed far from the pyramid but their minds were in turmoil. Wondering why Twelve,Twenty five,Scale and Drake would stay back in the pyramid,knowing fully well that The bombs were ticking inside the pyramid. ""Damn it!! We are supposed to be down with this shits!! Who lives in a pyramid except these old hags??"" A member of Alpha snorted as he stood close to their cars. The outside of the pyramid was filled with cars and cannons. Some member were all moody as they sat on the bonnet of other cars. The guy who had spoken earlier immediately kept quiet as he walked towards two of their men who were wearing a sad and as well vexed expression. He patted their backs ""It's okay! That is the game,it's either we die or they die! It's normal to lose brothers in the feud but we just have to let it go because....."" ""We're Alphas!"" ""We're alphas!!"" The shout resonated in the area as they used that mantra to boost their morale. ""So it's okay.let's just wait for the other four brothers to come out!!"" The guy,Scale,said again and he went to the car to seat. Some stood to watch over the place in case of the unexpected. Alexander swiftly took out his gun from his back pocket and placed his hand on the trigger. His expression was dark,though he had a calm and imposing expression on,within him was in turmoil. He couldn't leave there recklessly and he had to go meet Amelia. He was scared..... So scared. He placed his hand on the trigger,eyes so distant and fierce. Grey Point his gun directly to Alexander's Chest,Knight's command for him to pull the trigger was what he was relentlessly waiting for. Finally the bastard was here!! Grey was so happy and His face couldn't help but shriek as he glared hard at Alexander. ""Haha Alexander you're something else! You just have to go! No need pretending strong! Your Amelia's life is in danger!"" Knight suddenly laughed out and Alexander frowned so deeply. Knight had a hand in all these and he wanted to blackmail him.! Alexander dropped his gun lazily as he Swirled the gun in his hand leisurely. ""Before you try to blackmail me! Think about that little Lolita you've being hiding for a while now!"" Alexander said calmly as he had a playful smile on. Knight's eyes constricted as he frowned deeply at Alexander,his mind in turmoil. ""Everybody retreat calmly!"" Knight whispered To Grey who was also frowning. George was confused at what Alexander said,What little Lolita was Alexander talking about?? Liam maintained a calm expression as he stood in front of Alexander and Alexander got the message and quickly took a step back and entered the car close by and drove off.

facebook,"In the nineteen-twenties the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega Y Gasset, complained that his was the first generation in which educated men knew no history: not only did people not know the past, but they had lost a sense of history and of history's relevance to the present and future. So what does history teach us? To me, the most significant lesson is: never appease an aggressor. If we do, he will only grow stronger and more confident, and to secure his ultimate defeat will require greater effort and greater sacrifice.

How many of you demanded justice? Have her killers been caught? You guys moved on as if it was a mosquito that was killed. Yet, you want to dance naked in the streets over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Justice for Israel, Free Israel. Which justice did you give Harira and her children?

facebook,"The Solar Plexus Chakra This is the chakra of instinct, of gut feelings and reactions. It has great psychic antennae which reach out to check that your family and friends are safe. Its feelers are constantly moving to see that no cars are driving too close to you on the motorway or that you are not being cheated. At the third dimensional level this chakra holds your deepest fears, which may well be unconscious but will nevertheless rule your life. If someone else with the same anxieties comes near you, your chakra will tense up. As you raise your frequency this chakra relaxes and your fears dissolve so you feel more tranquil and can spread a feeling of peace to others. When you reach the fifth dimensional level you spread serenity and calm wherever you go. You feel contented and the wisdom you have gained in past lives becomes available to you once more. Then this chakra becomes deep gold with rainbow lights in it. Archangel Uriel, who is in charge of the angels of peace, helps with its evolution and development to enable you eventually to spread peace on Earth. When it is fully evolved you can connect with other star systems to spread goodwill. There are thirty three chambers or petals in this chakra. Archangel Uriel assists by drawing negativity from your chakras so if you see one of his Orbs which is brown or murky, it has absorbed negativity and is taking it to the light to transmute. Archangel Uriel also radiates divine light and wisdom from the chambers within his Orbs into your solar plexus. If you see one of his Orbs shining golden yellow, breathe the energy in as deeply as you can. Every time you choose peace over conflict, calm over aggression or courage over cowardice you strengthen your solar plexus and Archangel Uriel connects more closely to you. #chakra #chakrahealing #chakrabalancing #solarplexuschakra #solarplexus #solarplexushealing",,956,"{'like_count': 441, 'comment_count': 43, 'num_users': 221436}",Diana Cooper - Angels & Ascension,,2023-10-08 18:25:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/383091789_844275660399022_8036446003260646350_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6Aen3zoyOa0AX87U_fk&_nc_oc=AQlG1Dr2q4GkqeH-Ag0MbaYeSz62KW6Hs9qUhz5zLf9COj569Cw1pjk9uJxE3Eur_WQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAPOstVaNrij2EHLKEAPNygP-UFr8hqsEZ-ZWiqxEVn2g&oe=655AB060,https://www.facebook.com/100044497866861/posts/850968723063049,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385094389_850968696396385_5132554241207858372_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=BZMkdurLFQwAX-n4oCB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBVcIR7rPyb1MAy8vz52uo2Wv3VjTWe-XsklX1wV1FyYQ&oe=6559C811

facebook,"De beelden zijn vreselijk... Als reactie op de aanval die Hamas gisteren vanuit Gaza lanceerde, ontketent het Isra√´lische leger een zoveelste keer zijn vuurkracht. De regio staat eens te meer in lichterlaaie en voor de komende uren en dagen moet het ergste worden gevreesd. Onze gedachten gaan uit naar alle onschuldige burgerslachtoffers, aan beide kanten. 

Maar laten we duidelijk zijn: de oorlog die Benjamin Netanyahu en zijn regering vandaag zeggen uit te roepen tegen de Palestijnen, is al meer dan 75 jaar geleden begonnen. Aan de basis van het probleem liggen de Isra√´lische apartheid en bezetting, het onrecht en het dagelijkse geweld dat al die tijd al straffeloos wordt gepleegd.

‚ÄúDe onwettelijkheden worden in de eerste plaats gepleegd door Isra√´l, dat al 16 jaar een militaire blokkade in stand houdt, wat volgens het internationaal recht gelijk staat aan agressie. Meer in het algemeen is er de bezetting van de Palestijnse gebieden, met een kolonisatie die alleen maar toeneemt, met een hele reeks repressieve maatregelen tegen de Palestijnse bevolking, waaronder de vernieling van huizen‚Äù, legde Fran√ßois Dubuisson, professor internationaal recht aan de ULB, gisteren terecht uit op de RTBF. 

De toestand verslechtert nog met de huidige Isra√´lische regering, die bestaat uit extreemrechtse krachten. Dat toonden de gebeurtenissen van het voorbije jaar duidelijk aan: de invallen in de heilige plaatsen van de Al-Aqsa-moskee, de toenemende kolonisatie, met name van Sheikh Jarrah (Oost-Jeruzalem), de 247 Palestijnse doden sinds het begin van het jaar (v√≥√≥r dit weekend), de moord op journaliste Shireen Abu Akleh, de herhaalde aanvallen van Isra√´lische kolonisten op het dorp Huwara en de aanval op het vluchtelingenkamp van Jenin. Op 28 augustus publiceerde de ngo Human Rights Watch een alarmerend rapport waarin die het recordaantal Palestijnse kinderen die straffeloos worden gedood door de Isra√´lische bezettingstroepen, scherp veroordeelt. 

De Isra√´lische premier Benjamin Netanyahu verklaart nu: ‚ÄúWe gaan Gaza in een woestijn veranderen. Ik zeg tegen alle inwoners van Gaza dat ze moeten vluchten.‚Äù Maar waar moeten ze heen als ze al 16 jaar opgesloten zitten in een openluchtgevangenis van maar een paar vierkante kilometer? 

Niemand kan de situatie begrijpen of een oplossing voorstellen zonder deze realiteit in acht te nemen. Ook de steun van de Verenigde Staten en van Europese landen aan Isra√´l vormt een deel van het probleem. 

In plaats van Netanyahu te steunen in zijn oorlog, moeten we oproepen tot een onmiddellijk staakt-het-vuren en een dringende de-escalatie. Zeker omdat het conflict zich dreigt uit te breiden over de hele regio.

Er moet een uitweg komen aan deze tragische spiraal van geweld: de bezetting be√´indigen is de enige manier om tot een rechtvaardige en duurzame vrede te komen.",,904,"{'like_count': 351, 'comment_count': 229, 'num_users': 112955}",PVDA,,2023-10-08 11:19:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/264132901_10158797593788768_535938646886097385_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=dlZ6461c_g4AX8b9x8W&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBY9C5KJEeGl2cFbfsTHz6zV8IZbcDzjNAJ_O7BbeeAvA&oe=6559DE6A,https://www.facebook.com/100044261237813/posts/904669001018466,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387757900_871879984294243_7687233800275904269_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=TcibPRtPoLgAX-fzLBn&_nc_oc=AQnwpBe5TB4YTadFTs9Oj_HT4XeBPPTDYURxhGKf4Vmd6FciUTbt3bdNURexgyPDBJU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBuDRyXKjJHS8n_K3JEWAwP0c_4PyarokPRdDjREk79KQ&oe=655AEE2B

facebook,"NATIVE AMERICANS ‚Äì THE FIRST OWNERS OF AMERICA Native Americans, or the indigenous peoples of the Americas, are the pre-Columbian inhabitants of North and South America and their descendants. Those who live within the boundaries of the present-day United States are composed of numerous, distinct tribes, bands and ethnic groups, many of which survive as intact, sovereign nations. Most authorities agree that the first evidence of people inhabiting North America indicates that they migrated here from Eurasia over 13,000 years ago, most likely crossing along the Bering Land Bridge, which was in existence during the Ice Age. However, some historians believe that people had migrated into the Americas much earlier, up to 40,000 years ago. These early Paleo-Indians spread throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes. Application of the term ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. However, there is considerable evidence in support of successful explorations which led to Norse settlement of Greenland, the L‚ÄôAnse aux Meadows settlement in Newfoundland, and potentially others some 500 years prior to Columbus landing in the Bahamas. From the Native American aspect, many tribes‚Äô oral histories indicate they have been living here since their genesis, as described by a wide range of creation myths. By the time European adventurers arrived in the 15th century, scholars estimate that more than 50 million people were already living in the Americas. Of these, some 10 million lived in the region that would later become the United States. As time passed, these migrants and their descendants pushed south and east, adapting as they went. With these new arrivals came centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies. Today, Native Americans account for about 1.5 percent of the United States population, many of whom continue to take pride in their ancestral traditions ‚Äî still practicing the music, art, and ceremonies that took place many years ago.

facebook,"Who Gets To Be 'Hapa'? ‚ÄúHapa means part Native Hawaiian ‚Äî not part Asian‚Äù ‚ÄîPiikea Kalakau, middle school teacher ""There are times when it feels like identity theft"" ‚ÄîKealalokahi Losch, a professor of Hawaiian studies & Pacific Island studies at Kapi'olani Community College Sunset in Waikiki: Tourists sipping mai tais crowded the beachside hotel bar. When the server spotted my friend and me, he seemed to relax. ""Ah,"" he said, smiling. ""Two hapa girls."" He asked if we were from Hawaii. We weren't. We both have lived in Honolulu ‚Äî my friend lives there now ‚Äî but hail from California. It didn't matter. In that moment, he recognized our mixed racial backgrounds and used ""hapa"" like a secret handshake, suggesting we were aligned with him: insiders and not tourists. Like many multiracial Asian-Americans, I identify as hapa, a Hawaiian word for ""part"" that has spread beyond the islands to describe anyone who's part Asian or Pacific Islander. When I first learned the term in college, wearing it felt thrilling in a tempered way, like trying on a beautiful gown I couldn't afford. Hapa seemed like the identity of lucky mixed-race people far away, people who'd grown up in Hawaii as the norm, without ""Chink"" taunts, mangled name pronunciations, or questions about what they were. Over time, as more and more people called me hapa, I let myself embrace the word. It's a term that explains who I am and connects me to others in an instant. It's a term that creates a sense of community around similar life experiences and questions of identity. It's what my fianc√© and I call ourselves, and how we think of the children we might have: second-generation hapas. But as the term grows in popularity, so does debate over how it should be used. Some people argue that hapa is a slur and should be retired. ""[It] is an ugly term born of racist closed-mindedness much like 'half-breed' or 'mulatto,'"" design consultant Warren Wake wrote to Code Switch after reading my piece on a ""hapa Bachelorette."" Several scholars told me it's a misconception that hapa has derogatory roots. The word entered the Hawaiian language in the early 1800s, with the arrival of Christian missionaries who instituted a Hawaiian alphabet and developed curriculum for schools. Hapa is a transliteration of the English word ""half,"" but quickly came to mean ""part,"" combining with numbers to make fractions. (For example, hapalua is half. Hapaha is one-fourth.) Hapa haole ‚Äî part foreigner ‚Äî came to mean a mix of Hawaiian and other, whether describing a mixed-race person, a fusion song, a bilingual Bible, or pidgin language itself. This original use was not negative, said Kealalokahi Losch, a professor of Hawaiian studies and Pacific Island studies at Kapi'olani Community College. ""The reason [hapa] feels good is because it's always felt good,"" he told me. Losch has been one of the few to study the earliest recorded uses of the term, buried in Hawaiian-language newspapers, and found no evidence that it began as derogatory. Because the Hawaiian kingdom was more concerned with genealogy than race, he explained, if you could trace your lineage to a Hawaiian ancestor, you were Hawaiian. Mixed Hawaiian did not mean less Hawaiian. Any use of hapa as a slur originated with outsiders, Losch said. That includes New England missionaries, Asian plantation workers and the U.S. government, which instituted blood quantum laws to limit eligibility for Hawaiian homestead lands. On the continental U.S., some members of Japanese-American communities employed hapa to make those who were mixed ""feel like they were not really, truly Japanese or Japanese-American,"" ‚ÄîDuncan Williams, a professor of religion and East Asian languages and cultures at the University of Southern California He said this history may have led some to believe the word is offensive. For Losch, ""hapa haole"" ‚Äî meaning part Hawaiian, part other ‚Äî always has been positive. ""This is absolutely who I am,"" he said. The license plate on his car reads, ""HAPA H."" His family members have been proud hapa haole for generations. An issue for him is when non-Hawaiians call themselves hapa. ""There are times when it feels like identity theft,"" he said. This is arguably the trickier and more significant conflict around the term. Hapa, middle school teacher Piikea Kalakau told me, means part Native Hawaiian ‚Äî not part Asian. ""I ... am personally frustrated with the world misusing this word ...,"" she wrote in an email. I followed up with Kalakau by phone. The widespread use of hapa, she said, is a form of cultural appropriation, just as offensive as hula dancer dolls shaking their hips on car dashboards. She said correcting the definition of hapa is part of a larger Native Hawaiian ""movement to take back our culture."" She said her people were fighting to thrive again after surviving colonization and its damage to their language, culture and population. Kalakau encouraged me and other mixed Asian-Americans to find labels from our own (truncated)",,725,"{'like_count': 297, 'comment_count': 203, 'num_users': 16943}",What's Happening on Kaua'i,,2023-10-08 19:21:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/306131309_468440168632058_8461833228573485757_n.jpg?stp=c8.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=sIiRXVDGyKMAX8nh0Fz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBPhOo2Rb9_TZBWJs6gKGCCI1i0-rcC-OGGTEc_P0pzPg&oe=655A4F61,https://www.facebook.com/100063982360193/posts/723593226450083,

Let us pray for Israel with the Holy Father to the God of peace so that the clamor of weapons ends, and solutions can be found around a table of dialogue to end the conflict in order that the people there can live in peace, safety, and with mutual respect. Let us pray through the intercession of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage.

O Beloved Virgin of Peace and Good Voyage, we your children come to you as we pray together with the Holy Father and faithful around the world for our brothers and sisters in Israel. Grant us now your aid as Virgin of Peace for the greater honor and glory of God.

We ask you to instill peace in their hearts and souls. Ask your Son to let them be free of yearning after vain and worldly things. Guide and guard them in human frailty. Lead them to dialogue towards mutual respect. Against all mortal dangers, be their shield. As they journey towards their safety, be their guide.

Place all mankind under your protection, Blessed Mother, and bring us through the strife of this world into the everlasting peace of Christ. Amen.

facebook,"Social disintegration is one of the core themes in the novel# Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. It rises in the last chapters of the book where Umofia, an Igbo tribe is threatened by white domination. This brings pain to the reader who was perhaps sympathizing with the traditions and culture of the people of Umofia. The image of African native community and culture is presented in ' Things Fall Apart' by Achebe is an image of a coherent social structure. The white men are self-proud, cunning and aggressive and they have a plan to envangelize the tribes, where as the tribesman are humble naive. The white men have destroyed the Umofia by separating it's men to fight and blame each other, tying their tails to fight each other like dogs. Achebe explores that the whole of the cultural encounter, conflict and final disintegration of the tribe: "" The white man is clever. He came quietly and peacefully with his religion. We were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to stay. He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart"". Cultural beliefs and religion have a long history of playing a vital role in uniting people to a one voice. It is therefore difficult to unite a community with different cultures and religious beliefs. Though it is a clear misconception that the African culture is savage and primitive, it is however a mistake also to expect every other culture to develop and grow on the Western model. The African culture never need a redeemer like the white man's. #Things Fall Apart By Chinua Achebe #ChinuaAchebe #IgboProverb #AfricanLiterature #TellOurStory",,700,"{'like_count': 516, 'comment_count': 62, 'num_users': 124428}",Chinua Achebe's Quotes and Proverbs,,2023-10-08 08:38:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/215880230_100565372310782_640038502639987800_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=_BQwnnLTcH4AX_1TOWc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfACOOXtZC2L6wfjy1n1Enz9Yrz_FssHcvLK-HfP0GZEYg&oe=6559EA7E,https://www.facebook.com/100070805591166/posts/356642386705945,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387780582_356642356705948_9077526046956783336_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6huXoUpN-4oAX_KZuh0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBdX5jJzZVpXE9TYLpqnZIeSGETERr8xL9R45eLkIhRmA&oe=653E352D

facebook,"I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it. There are some storms ahead. Some of them may hit this week, and they could have outsized implications for the nation, and even the world, going forward. Let‚Äôs take a look at three in particular.

**The Israel / Hamas war

On Saturday, in a surprise move, Hamas militants broke through Israel‚Äôs barriers in Gaza and committed several coordinated assaults upon Israeli armed forces as well as terrorist attacks upon civilians. There are hundreds dead and thousands wounded already on both sides. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was now at war with Hamas, vowing and already initiating retaliation for the attacks.

The escalation into open warfare carries serious consequences and risks. The hostilities could bring other actors directly into conflict, including Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, backed by Iran. The unrest and fighting could spread to the West Bank, which is the other part of the Palestinian Territories. Far-right political factions in Israel could seize the moment politically to press their gains as the opposition, seeing the need for national unity, halts its protests over planned judicial ‚Äúreforms‚Äù that undermine democracy in the nation.

There is already political fallout in the U.S. as Republicans cast blame upon the Biden Administration for the attack, including falsely claiming that the $6 billion deal with Iran was to blame, even though that money remains unspent in an overseas account and is earmarked for humanitarian aid only. And progress on the Abraham Accords, which seek to establish further diplomatic relations between Israel and key Arab neighbors including Saudi Arabia, are likely on hold while civilian deaths within Gaza and Israel inevitably and tragically mount.

I will be writing a larger piece on Tuesday in The Big Picture substack, where I write once a week, to lay out the geopolitical concerns and risks that arise directly from this weekend‚Äôs events. As part of that, I‚Äôll set some context for why Hamas, which the U.S. has labeled a terrorist organization and which has called for the destruction of Israel, nevertheless enjoys broad support for its actions within the Arab world. At issue is the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza, including a long and sustained quarantining of the region and its two million inhabitants. I‚Äôll also walk through why achieving peace in the region is now very much harder given the bloody and brutal attack upon Israeli civilians committed by Hamas, which some are comparing to the 9/11 attacks on U.S. soil.

A word of caution: This is a very fraught subject that tends to divide U.S. progressives and thus even my readers here, and passions understandably run very high on all sides. Please be respectful in the comments and toward one another. My piece on Tuesday in The Big Picture will attempt to set out the facts and positions of the parties as objectively as possible, and most importantly to assess the political risks going forward, though I already know that it is nearly impossible to be seen as purely objective and dispassionate on this issue. I am not a Middle East expert, and after decades of watching others attempt to broker peace, I have no solutions to add. But I am well aware of the history and the arguments from all sides, and I can speak to the political impact of the war and what we in the U.S. should watch for.

**Leaderless in the House, paralysis in the Senate

The escalation to war in Gaza comes at a time when the U.S. is facing a first in its history: the lack of a Speaker of the House. And over in the Senate, the antics of Senator Tommy Tuberville have left hundreds of key military positions unfilled. Add to that the fact that the Senate has yet to confirm Joe Biden‚Äôs nominee for ambassador to Israel, and it is fair to say the U.S. is far weaker than it should be in this time of crisis.

A Speaker is necessary to guide emergency funding bills for Israel through that chamber. The acting speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), lacks the power to move legislation through the body and is only a caretaker until an actual Speaker can be elected by majority vote. Currently, there are only two candidates declared for the position: Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), a staunch conservative who was in the No. 2 position in the conference before McCarthy was ousted, and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a MAGA extremist who heads the House Judiciary Committee. It is fairly clear that neither candidate has enough votes on his own to form a majority, so we will need to see after the first round of balloting how much support each actually has, and whether one will cede the race to the other.

Time is of the essence, however, not only to provide emergency aid to Israel, but also to head off a government (truncated)",,672,"{'like_count': 443, 'comment_count': 105, 'num_users': 9395438}",George Takei,,2023-10-08 23:45:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/272452483_470819554415894_2093320837450724405_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=T0u5JMmSdbkAX9tTzeh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA6aZkS7aIuBMo0vftxcJGJtRcVCVbwgXFU1_drTHhiA&oe=655A9EEE,https://www.facebook.com/100044635590185/posts/855859585911887,

facebook,"Sun sign (SUN SHINE) messages for 9th October, 2023 THESE ARE BASED ON SUN SIGNS‚Ä¶. ( To make the most from these messages I request you to do this small ritual before reading. Sit in relaxed manner, take few deep breaths and say I am open to receive the divine guidance that I need to follow today. I can read between the lines and understand what is beneath the words written. I surrender my logic and reasoning and read it with faith and trust in the divine energies. ) ARIES (March 21 to April 19) : Do not gossip about others, so you will harm not only them but also you. Your desire will be fulfilled, but in a different way, not the way you would like. Stop complaining about your fate and be ready to take action to change life. Stress will affect your mind and body, take care of your health if you feel the need then don't delay going to the doctor. Don't think negatively. TAURUS (April 20 - May 20) : Calm down; do not get angry, the situation will soon be fine. Now it is hard to find allies. Be careful what you say and do not start doing anything new. To achieve great outcome for all the efforts you put in, focus on blessings in your life and be grateful for it. Seek forgiveness from people who you may have hurt you. Soon things will start moving in the right direction. GEMINI (May 21 - June 21) : God will give you all good things. The power of your thoughts is the most important factor in this matter. The mind can control and change circumstances, even your physical health. The power of the mind triumphs over matter. Visualise the outcome that you desire and believe it that it is yours and it will be yours soon. Remember you have the power to create the life you desire. CANCER (June 21 - July 22) : You will meet a person who will make you feel butterflies in your stomach. New relationships will help you in your work, you will be a great success. This is very good time for you to embrace love, joy, happiness and abundance in your life. Believe that you are worthy of love. Love who you are, love your life, love your job etc. and life will love you back. LEO (July 23 -August 22) : Look into the past to understand the causes of what is happening now. Let your intuition guide you on this journey. Release the urge to be in control or be right and have everything your way. Be open to take support and help of others. Allow others guidance, advice and suggestions to work for you. Being stubborn will not be beneficial for you right now, be flexible. VIRGO (August 23 - September 22) : Don't run away from problems but face them. Avoiding taking action or decision will create more challenges. Instead work on resolving whatever is bothering you, even one step from you will help you move forward. Though slow but soon you will find your way out. But standing looking at the problem will not resolve it. Take action now without any further delay. LIBRA (September 23 - October 22) : Big changes are coming into your life which you may not have anticipated but this is divine plan. Be open to embrace changes without forcing to change anything or swim in the opposite flow. Just go with the flow of life and you will realise why the change of course occurred. Sometimes it is better to be open for whatever comes to us rather than wishing what we desire to come. SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21) : You will be able to achieve your short and long term goals. You will also experience materialistic abundance. All your efforts will bring you success, victory and happiness. You are on the right path, doing the right thing. Just keep giving your best and be open to receive blessings from universe. Stay focused on your biggest dreams and take actions to achieve them, it will be yours. SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21) : You may have some Conflict or dispute with a very unpleasant outcome. If possible, avoid any conflicts. Now is the time to be alone and do your work quietly without letting anyone know. Be aware of your own thoughts and also with whom you spend most of your time. As their energies will rub on you and you will gradually become like them. Stay happy and positive. CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19) : A time comes when it will be possible to solve all your problems. There is a sudden and long-term surge of power, a favorable period in all areas of life. Logic and calculations are not needed right now, you are better guided by your heart and inner instincts. You are in perfect alignment with energies of happiness and love and that is bringing you all that you desire. AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18) : You have someone in your life who will make you believe in yourself, stay connected with that person in any manner. New connections will help you in your work, you will be a great success. You have people in your life who will help you achieve success, growth, abundance etc. in your life. You just have to listen to them, seek their advice and guidance with faith and trust.

Let us pray for Israel with the Holy Father to the God of peace so that the clamor of weapons ends, and solutions can be found around a table of dialogue to end the conflict in order that the people there can live in peace, safety, and with mutual respect. Let us pray through the intercession of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage.

O Beloved Virgin of Peace and Good Voyage, we your children come to you as we pray together with the Holy Father and faithful around the world for our brothers and sisters in Israel. Grant us now your aid as Virgin of Peace for the greater honor and glory of God.

We ask you to instill peace in their hearts and souls. Ask your Son to let them be free of yearning after vain and worldly things. Guide and guard them in human frailty. Lead them to dialogue towards mutual respect. Against all mortal dangers, be their shield. As they journey towards their safety, be their guide.

Place all mankind under your protection, Blessed Mother, and bring us through the strife of this world into the everlasting peace of Christ. Amen.

Heavy energies however: Aries, Taurus, Virgo, Libra, Capricorn, Pisces Spirit talks right to that little child within you. Acknowledging you have a deep inner knowing that reflects the experiences of rejection you faced, especially during your childhood. There were instances where you sensed danger or unease in your dreams, trying to communicate this to the people who were meant to protect you. Unfortunately, they didn't listen. This pattern of not being heard carried into your adult life, where you may have found yourself being hurt by others for ignoring your intuition. The fear of rejection has made you doubt your own inner voice. It's crucial to reconnect with your truth, gifts, and abilities. While some may not understand or accept them, labeling you as insane or going through something, you know deep down that you see things as they truly are. Remember, though, that experiencing hurt from others doesn't mean you have to retaliate. This is a time for inner healing, not engaging in conflict. It's essential to find peace with the choices you made to stay and remain vulnerable for as long as you did. Let what has happened serve as inspiration to move forward and cultivate personal growth and abundance in your life. The deep bonds and acceptance you crave from others will come, but first, you must prioritize self-love and self-acceptance. Embrace and nurture yourself with love, and the rest will follow. üíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõüíõ Allow this post to be a safe space to release!

facebook,"‚ÄúOn Saturday, Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented invasion across Israel‚Äôs southern border with Gaza, storming Israeli towns and killing Israeli soldiers and civilians alike. Nothing like this has happened in the modern history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Now an outright war between Israel and Hamas has begun, one whose consequences for the conflict and the broader Middle East we can only dimly anticipate. The only thing we can be certain about the future is that many, many people are about to die. How can we begin to think about such a nightmare? We can start by examining the conditions that made it possible.‚Äù Read more from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp at the link in our bio.",,535,"{'like_count': 142, 'comment_count': 248, 'num_users': 3938492}",Vox,,2023-10-08 19:37:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352755735_215850477460422_3161943018736237157_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=38IFGVAgaiQAX9IcBNz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCg2IKdnK5-30x9dTiBArFZXfIq5OCrCNk0giVchwC1WA&oe=6559DB6E,https://www.facebook.com/100059566840065/posts/701655311830024,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387156341_701648185164070_2155163509793455267_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rQXeNc57ExMAX_5gJRo&_nc_oc=AQkM8zSpKAq_jOoZEz0sROnvSo0Lempb-qKBCMLaEwOacffjwdvfTlzu74NofRjs1tc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDqRU_vVDVWWK1Iva-wvsm_nPk5XYONt17exVL4ow0ccw&oe=6544A808

facebook,"‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚Äù, Kintpuash (c. 1837-1873) Modoc Tribe, Oregon and California Kintpuash was born near Tule Lake, an area that now straddles the Oregon-California border. The ancestral homeland of the Modoc Peoples consisted of 5,000 acres until 1864 when they were forcibly removed by the federal government to the lands of their neighbors on the newly-created Klamath Reservation. The Klamath was a much larger tribe than the Modoc, and conflict was inevitable. Now casually referred to as ‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚Äù by white colonizers, Kintpuash stood firm. In 1865 he led a band of Modoc from the reservation back to their lands in California. Four years went by before the United States army rounded them up again and back to Klamath territory, but Kintpuash was undaunted. In 1870 he marched back home again with 180 of his Modoc kinsmen. The government‚Äôs outright refusal to allow the Modoc back into their homelands led to the outbreak of the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873. Kintpuash fled with his band into the area now protected as the Lava Beds National Monument, and they settled into this natural fortress. His warriors made use of its many caves and trenches in the lava beds for defensive fighting, and women and children could be sheltered there. When the Modoc were finally located, the Army launched an attack on January 17, 1873. The US Army was beaten in this conflict but they weren‚Äôt retreating either. Kintpuash‚Äôs advisers suggested that the Army would leave if their warriors killed its leader General Edward Canby, (the future namesake of the town of Canby, Oregon) but Kintpuash hoped for a peaceful solution that would allow his people to stay in their territory. It wasn‚Äôt to be. During the next meeting of the peace commission on April 11, Kintpuash and several other Modoc broke down and drew pistols at a prearranged signal; he shot General Canby twice in the head. For this, he was executed on October 3, 1873.

facebook,"The Holy Land, a place sacred to countless millions around the world, is currently mired in violence and suffering due to the prolonged political conflict and the lamentable absence of justice and respect for human rights. We, the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, have time and again appealed for the importance of respecting the historic and legal Status Quo of the holy shrines. In these trying times, we come together to raise our voices in unity, echoing the divine message of peace and love for all humanity. As custodians of the Christian faith, deeply rooted in the Holy Land, we stand in solidarity with the people of this region, who are enduring the devastating consequences of continued strife. Our faith, which is founded on the teachings of Jesus Christ, compels us to advocate for the cessation of all violent and military activities that bring harm to both Palestinian and Israeli civilians. We unequivocally condemn any acts that target civilians, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, or faith. Such actions go against the fundamental principles of humanity and the teachings of Christ, who implored us to ""love your neighbour as yourself"" {Mark 12:31). It is our fervent hope and prayer that all parties involved will heed this call for an immediate cessation of violence. We implore political leaders and authorities to engage in sincere dialogue, seeking lasting solutions that promote justice, peace, and reconciliation for the people of this land, who have endured the burdens of conflict for far too long. In our capacity as spiritual leaders, we extend our hands to all those who suffer, and we pray that the Almighty may grant comfort to the afflicted, strength to the weary, and wisdom to those in positions of authority. We call upon the international community to redouble its efforts to mediate a just and lasting peace in the Holy Land, based on equal rights for all and on international legitimacy. Let us remember the words of the Apostle Paul: ""For God is not a God of disorder but of peace"" (1 Corinthians 14:33). In the spirit of this divine message, we implore all to work tirelessly towards an end to violence and the establishment of a just and lasting peace that will allow the Holy Land to be a beacon of hope, faith, and love for all. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with us all during these challenging times. - The Patriarchs and Heads of the Churches in Jerusalem",,475,"{'like_count': 199, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 25196}",Brian Zahnd,,2023-10-08 19:10:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/308492336_628484471979465_4503963110613860185_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=xHkQpxFwQDkAX_zMXju&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDkExOyGfdjlmlnPtoVygVBNG-qqgO0QI7YHOPfHQ_O5w&oe=6559AC6E,https://www.facebook.com/100044537525132/posts/853974069430503,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/368288943_853974039430506_6737486995555810610_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=vEJE8w8Z0FIAX-P9o6b&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBAuZqWgyL-p3kG_WO5hjEThzwwzatCYCXuUmpdENyagA&oe=65560C28

Far behind, from the trunks of Crocodile Bark (ain) and Coromandel Ebony (tendu) trees, interspersed with Vetiver (khus) grasses, emerged the variegated animal, and a volley of distress calls filled the air. They call her the queen of Tadoba, with pride. True to her name, she‚Äôs the doyen of illusion. She is a master of the game but a benevolent beast. Captivatingly attractive to her suitors, she is an enchantress but paradoxically a loyal consort. She‚Äôs an endearing and protective mother, always caught in crosshairs -her world is torn between a conflict she didn‚Äôt start and the imperative to defend. She has a paradigm of tigrine flair but embodying feminine struggle. Has her adversity and age gotten the better of her, or has she been raising her cubs beyond plain sight? Conspicuous by her absence, the land of Taru seems like a shrine denuded of its icon. Will the greatest queen stage a break of the dawn or fade into the night? A comeback of the ageing Maya is as hopeful and comforting but it might turn out to be poignant and heartbreaking. Every path she treads now, only puts her in a more precarious position than the previous. But such is life. ùòä'ùò¶ùò¥ùòµ ùò≠ùò¢ ùò∑ùò™ùò¶ ‚Äì shit happens.

facebook,"Joan of Arc Was Excommunicated By The Same Church That Later Made Her A Saint Joan of Arc (or Jeanne d'Arc, as she was known in her native French) was a young warrior who claimed to have been sent by God to lead France to victory over England, most notably by helping the Dauphin Charles to be crowned king. Born in 1412, Joan began to experience intense religious visions at the age of 13. She described how the archangel Michael came to her, alongside St. Catherine and St. Margaret, and told her to consecrate her entire being to God. The voices Joan heard communicated that she was intended for a great purpose and that she was to help drive the English out of France in the conflict that would come to be known as the Hundred Years' War. The voices led her to seek out Charles and urge him to seek coronation. After many trials in which she was ridiculed and ignored, Joan finally got her chance for an audience. She won the support of Charles, and many others began to believe she was truly on a divine mission. With backing from French royalty, Joan set out on her campaign to liberate Orleans, dressed as a male for an extra measure of safety as she traveled through the wilds with only a small team of men to protect her. Joan went on to courageously lead troops to retake Orleans and push back the English in several key conflicts. Her bravery, devotion to God, and pious conduct inspired great morale in her followers, and before she turned 20, she blazed a trail that facilitated the crowning of the dauphin as Charles VII of France. Joan's visions and voices subsided, but she still refused to leave the battlefield. After a failed attempt to retake Paris, Joan was captured by the Burgundians at Compi√®gne and offered for ransom. Tragically, the same king she fought so hard for refused to pay the ransom. Joan was sold to the English and made to undergo a rigorous series of interrogations and trials. During this time, Joan was excommunicated by a bishop who seemed to think she was in league with satanic forces. Joan's protests and cries for divine assistance after this announcement were so heart-rending that many in the crowd, including an English cardinal, were seen weeping. Though Joan burned at the stake at the hands of her captors, her memory and heroism became immortal. In 1920, Joan was canonized and became a saint.

Nevertheless, we have decided to repost with a neutral picture to avoid giving the impression that we are taking sides in this long-lasting and complex conflict. We fully recognize the intricacies of this conflict and do not intend to oversimplify it or pass judgment, as many of you do with the freedom to express your opinions. We unequivocally denounce violence in all its forms and are deeply troubled by how some justify violence with more violence, as if it could ever bring about a solution. Typically, we avoid commenting on political matters. However, the recent attack on a psytrance festival by terrorists, resulting in injuries, deaths, and abductions among our friends and fellow attendees, compels us to offer assistance, condolences, and compassion. We firmly believe in personal freedom, freedom of speech, religion, sexuality, and political orientation. No one should face discrimination, violence, or abduction for making these personal choices. We are absolutely shocked, heartbroken, and in agony over the recent terrorist attack in Israel. This attack targeted the modern way of life and personal freedom, and it is incredibly difficult to put into words the sorrow we're feeling about the attack and its many victims, including those within our subculture. We can't imagine what it must be like to run for your life from the very place where you were joyfully dancing. In the midst of all this, we want you to know that we stand with you, our community, during this difficult time. If you're searching for missing friends or loved ones, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

facebook,"Our special Exhibition ‚ÄûGermany at Sea‚Äú provides an overview of the 175 years of history of the German Navies. It is displayed on Deck 1 of the Museum until November the 5th 2023. One of the displays focuses on the importance on the development of the submarine weapon for the navy of the German Imperial Navy since the beginning of the 20th Century and during World War I. The display also explains the propagandistic dimension of the use of submarines during the war and also contains this astonishing model. Submarine ‚ÄúU 96‚Äù, 1917 As late as the beginning of 1915, the German naval authorities assumed that the war would soon be over. Large U-boats, which took far more than a year to complete, seemed only conditionally necessary for a war decision. They were part of longer-term planning for a threat against Britain beyond a war‚Äôs end. Things turned out differently, however. The conflict continued, and by mid-1915 naval surface ships, except for a few raiders, were no longer present on the world‚Äôs oceans. The submarines were engaged in commercial warfare alone. Those of type ‚ÄúU 96‚Äù to ‚ÄúU 98‚Äù were ordered on September 15, 1915. They were boats of 837 tons displacement and 71.5 meters length. They carried six torpedo tubes and a 10.5 cm gun; their diving depth was 50 meters. ‚ÄúU 96,‚Äù commissioned in April 1917, sunk 31 merchant ships under the command of lieutenant Heinrich Je√ü and was scrapped at Bo‚Äôness in 1920.

facebook,"Healthy boundaries will protect you from overextending yourself in life. They will also protect the health of your marriage when they're clearly defined. Here are a few ways you can tangibly create boundaries that protect your marriage, whilst also making sure you're BOTH on the same side of lines drawn: 1) Time. A lack of connected, quality time is the #1 issue couple's face today. It's ironic, since the world is more ""connected"" than ever. You must understand that your time is finite... you have a very limited amount. This means you must draw boundaries to block out wasteful or frivolous uses of it. Do this by turning off devices and spending quality time together. In 20 years, you won't remember what you read on social media but you will absolutely remember the moments you spend together. 2) Reconciliation. You will have arguments and fights, which means you will need to reconcile. Draw boundaries around the reconciliation process by agreeing not to bad-talk each other to friends or coworkers in ways that are destructive. It's good to seek counsel and advice, but venting anger to those outside your marriage is never helpful. Then, WITHIN the boundary of reconciliation, work together to resolve conflict in a biblical way. Talk, repent, forgive, make-up, and move on. 3) Integrity and transparency. Those without transparency live by themselves in a boundary they've created. They do this by engaging in wrong behavior and then hiding it (think: explicit websites, spending habits, emotional and physical affairs, eating habits). The first step toward living with integrity in your marriage is being transparent with each other. Open up the unhealthy boundaries and let your spouse in. If you have a secret other than a surprise gift, etc., then something is wrong. There are many boundaries we could discuss, but hopefully this will get you thinking. What are some other boundaries you have/shouldn't have in your life/marriage?",,422,"{'like_count': 302, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 507915}",Thoughts of Jacktone,,2023-10-08 07:31:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338001205_1368720427298146_7411246640499111275_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y2RUnb3oDQYAX-HSA0u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBqyqTelr8rLeEt81yumQygWi0FvjjsEBUdmYP8UoZ7VA&oe=655B2E12,https://www.facebook.com/100064148888578/posts/717590560389234,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386375318_717590573722566_8107601240954022461_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=s7UoYH5f3YIAX-2DgBO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCriaHK0pc8KV5UW6w2jrocEx1ZIx2ZJYt5YpSB5N5Vow&oe=65265731
facebook,"Thoughts on death. Eerie subject? Well, it depends on how you look at it. Actually, the fact of death reminds us to appreciate life even the more. Every second, your life span is reducing. Is this negative? No, it's true and important information. Life is precious because it ends, it's valuable because it's not eternal. In the field of economics, any commodity that is scarce, will have a high price. But life is priceless because it's irreplaceable. Is it easy to get another life if you waste this one? Actually, no one has died and come back to live again. There's no evidence of that. Once you're gone, that's it. You only have one shot at this. A well known African proverb says, ""if you kill time, you bury opportunities."" Meaning: when you waste time, you can never regain it. Many of us do not realize that actually - time is our life. In other words, our life is a period of time! Therefore, as we're spending time, we're spending life itself. Imagine if we lived knowing that every day, utilizing the value of every precious moment. How many times can we avoid unnecessary conflict with others? Maybe that's our problem as humanity. We think we have time. Meanwhile, we only have now.

facebook,"We publish below the communiqu√© (available in English and Arabic) of the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem calling for peace and justice in the midst of the ongoing violence. *** The Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem unite in a Call for peace and justice amidst unfolding violence Jerusalem, october 7, 2023 The Holy Land, a place sacred to countless millions around the world, is currently mired in violence and suffering due to the prolonged political conflict and the lamentable absence of justice and respect for human rights. We, the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, have time and again appealed for the importance of respecting the historic and legal Status Quo of the holy shrines. In these trying times, we come together to raise our voices in unity, echoing the divine message of peace and love for all humanity. As custodians of the Christian faith, deeply rooted in the Holy Land, we stand in solidarity with the people of this region, who are enduring the devastating consequences of continued strife. Our faith, which is founded on the teachings of Jesus Christ, compels us to advocate for the cessation of all violent and military activities that bring harm to both Palestinian and Israeli civilians. We unequivocally condemn any acts that target civilians, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, or faith. Such actions go against the fundamental principles of humanity and the teachings of Christ, who implored us to ""love your neighbor as yourself"" (Mark 12:31). It is our fervent hope and prayer that all parties involved will heed this call for an immediate cessation of violence. We implore political leaders and authorities to engage in sincere dialogue, seeking lasting solutions that promote justice, peace, and reconciliation for the people of this land, who have endured the burdens of conflict for far too long. In our capacity as spiritual leaders, we extend our hands to all those who suffer, and we pray that the Almighty may grant comfort to the afflicted, strength to the weary, and wisdom to those in positions of authority. We call upon the international community to redouble its efforts to mediate a just and lasting peace in the Holy Land, based on equal rights for all and on international legitimacy. Let us remember the words of the Apostle Paul: ""For God is not a God of disorder but of peace"" (1 Corinthians 14:33). In the spirit of this divine message, we implore all to work tirelessly towards an end to violence and the establishment of a just and lasting peace that will allow the Holy Land to be a beacon of hope, faith, and love for all. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with us all during these challenging times. - The Patriarchs and Heads of the Churches in Jerusalem - https://www.custodia.org/en/news/patriarchs-and-heads-churches-jerusalem-unite-call-peace-and-justice-amidst-unfolding-violence",,382,"{'like_count': 138, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 65441}",Custodia Terr√¶ Sanct√¶,,2023-10-08 14:05:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311648332_439148678279606_7619256477646435710_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NVOhajCj6VkAX9UDZey&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBbL8-SIFe2JgpeHpBVVzuZ4f9PWZ9EDbGm30epPI7spA&oe=6559FF25,https://www.facebook.com/100065534323868/posts/651621990365606,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387783614_651621600365645_1780806131184525459_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ULSmhtr8ZVMAX_2TjBI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfATTrz7Gzp2oBv3gyXtsicds436uJcjYAL7GJRsp2IuuA&oe=655A9675

facebook,"You will remember that the location where Jesus was crucified was called Golgotha, which means ""place of the skull."" If we will be effective in spiritual warfare, the first field of conflict where we must learn warfare is the battleground of the mind; i.e., the ""place of the skull."" Indeed, the territory of the uncrucified thought life is the beachhead of satanic assault in our lives. To defeat the devil, we must be crucified in the place of the skull. We must be renewed in the spirit of our minds!

facebook,"Today's A Mighty Girl Community Pick is in honor of Emily Blackwell's birthday: ""The Doctors Blackwell: How Two Pioneering Sisters Brought Medicine to Women and Women to Medicine"" by Janice P. Nimura. From an early age, Elizabeth Blackwell had an intense focus on breaking out of the confining limits placed on the aspirations of women of her day. Overcoming skepticism and deeply ingrained sexism, she became the first female physician in America, eventually winning over the male medical establishment with her diligence and keen intellect. Her sister Emily soon followed in her footsteps and the two founded the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children, the first hospital staffed entirely by women. Both women were visionaries but their strongly held convictions and the fierce determination which allowed them to overcome centuries of discrimination against women in the medical profession also brought them into conflict at times. Even so, their partnership endured and together the sisters changed medicine forever by opening the doors for generations of female physicians after them. This richly researched biography tells the riveting story of the world-changing impact of these remarkable sisters, while providing an insightful look at the realities of 19th century medicine. Highly recommended for adult readers.

facebook,"Chief Crowfoot Crowfoot (1830 ‚Äì 25 April 1890) or Isapo-Muxika was a chief of the Siksika First Nation. His parents, Istowun-eh'pata (Packs a Knife) and Axkahp-say-pi (Attacked Towards Home), were Kainai. ""Crowfoot stood and watched as the white man scattered many dollar bills on the floor. ""This is what the white man trades in; this is his buffalo robe. As you trade pelts, we trade in these scraps of paper."" When the white chief put all his money on the ground and showed how much he would give if the Indians would sign a treaty, Crowfoot took a handful of clay, made a ball out of it, and set it on the fire. He didn't break. So he said to the white man, Now put your money on the fire and see if it lasts as long as clay. The white man said, No... my money will burn because it's made of paper. With an amused gleam in his eyes the old chief said, Oh, your money isn't as good as our land, is it? The wind will blow the fire will burn it; the water will rot it. But nothing will destroy our land. You don't make a very good trade. Then, with a smile, Crowfoot took a handful of sand from the riverbank, handed it to the white man, and said: You count the grains of sand in it while I count the money you give for the land. The white man said, I wouldn't live long enough to count this, but you can count the money in a few minutes. Very well, said the wise Crowfoot, our land is more valuable than your money. It will last forever. It will not perish as long as the sun shines and the water flows, and throughout all the years it will give life to men and animals, so we cannot sell the land. It was placed there by the Great Spirit and we can't sell it because it doesn't really belong to us. You can count your money and burn it with a nod of a buffalo's head, but only the Great Spirit can count the grains of sand and blades of grass on these plains. As a gift, we'll give you anything you can take with you, but we can't give you the land. ‚Äù Crowfoot was a warrior who fought in as many as nineteen battles and sustained many injuries, but he tried to obtain peace instead of warfare. Crowfoot is well known for his involvement in Treaty Number 7 and did much negotiating for his people. While many believe Chief Crowfoot had no part in the North-West Rebellion, he did in fact participate to an extent due to his son's connection to the conflict. Crowfoot died of tuberculosis at Blackfoot Crossing on April 25, 1890. Eight hundred of his tribe attended his funeral, along with government dignitaries. In 2008, Chief Crowfoot was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame where he was recognized for his contributions to the railway industry. Crowfoot is well known for his contributions to the Blackfoot nation, and has many memorials to signify his accomplishments.",,311,"{'like_count': 200, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 31629}",Indigenous Civilization,,2023-10-08 13:46:22,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/321640085_2401456676672467_8651481277708818487_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EriGeV8I-hsAX_Vtfap&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCuEx2S5PIxRSPZQlHmCuiLskEtqptY5Q1L14XK7kRmPg&oe=655B340E,https://www.facebook.com/100083733410347/posts/290742560393522,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/385091137_290742533726858_5472435711076034153_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=R-bmZFtMcAIAX-RPc-G&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC72_93wjAuiWUI0eprr_Kk3yhjtsgCJKSu7G5-DRM8KA&oe=65335EBE

facebook,"On September 22, 1871, an elderly British lady, 82 years young, was ushered into her heavenly reward. Earlier in her life, in 1835, her frustration at being an invalid left her feeling useless and questioning her very salvation. What she did next would echo through history. As a young woman, Charlotte Elliot was not sure of her relationship with Christ, not sure of how to be saved, even though she had been raised a minister's daughter, and the probing question of a Swiss evangelist, ‚ÄúAre you at peace with God?‚Äù, would not leave her mind. When she saw the evangelist a few weeks later, she mentioned that she could not shake his question. But, she protested, what could she possibly bring to God? When he replied that she need not bring anything but herself, she gladly accepted Christ. Some twelve years later, in 1835, crippled by illness and constant fatigue, she felt saddened by her inability to help a local church‚Äôs cause. Remembering her conversion, she took out pen and paper and wrote a poem to encourage others who felt perhaps they too had nothing to give. . . ""Just As I Am, without one plea, But that Thy blood was shed for me, And that Thou bidst me come to Thee, Oh, Lamb of God, I come..."" Her poem was published and she was inundated with requests for it. She was gladdened to discover later that some copies were being sold to raise money for the very cause she felt helpless to assist! After her death, thousands of letters were found in her home, written by people whose lives had been transformed by her words. Her song has been translated into hundreds of languages, published in more than 1600 hymnals, and has reached billions around the world, and continues to bring people to Christ even today. On Oct. 1, 1931, a 31-year-old man riding in the sidecar of his brother's motorcycle in England finally came to the end of his internal struggle against whether Christ was indeed the Son of God. He finally knew in his soul that indeed Jesus was just who He said He was! He realized that God calls us to Him ""just as we are"". When C.S. Lewis stepped out of the sidecar, he was a new man, saved by grace! Ninety-nine years after Charlotte Elliott penned her words, and 3 years after Lewis‚Äô conversion, the 16-year-old son of a dairy farmer listened intently as he heard the message of salvation preached at a revival service in Charlotte, NC. When the song, ‚ÄúJust As I Am,‚Äù was sung at the end, young Billy Graham went forward to accept Christ. Twenty years later, Billy Graham had become a successful evangelist and was invited to speak at Cambridge University in England. His nervousness over the event nearly led him to cancel it. But he was introduced to a kind man named C.S. Lewis who encouraged him to disregard the critics who had spoken out against him, and to continue with the revival. Rev. Graham went on to speak to an overflow crowd of 2,000 each night of the revival, and when he returned to England in 1989, he addressed a crowd of 80,000 at England‚Äôs Wimbley Stadium! As always, he closed the event with the same song that brought him to Christ, ‚ÄúJust As I Am.‚Äù Never think you have ‚Äúnothing‚Äù to bring to Jesus! That is exactly what He wants you to bring... nothing! He wants you, just you, as you are! He can take frustration like Charlotte Elliot‚Äôs, skepticism like Lewis‚Äô, and nervousness like Billy Graham‚Äôs, and reach the world through you!

facebook,"I condemn Hamas‚Äô terrorist attack and fully support Israel‚Äôs right to defend itself. Those who would equivocate about who is at fault here, or conflate Hamas‚Äô savagery with more nuanced questions about the Israel-Palestinian conflict, are misguided. This is about Hamas, a group of violent religious extremists who have sworn to kill all Jews in Israel and beyond. One of the communities attacked yesterday is Kfar Aza, a kibbutz on the Gaza border that I visited last year. The Israelis I met were not rightwing settlers or zealots; they were thoughtful, compassionate people. Despite living under constant threat of Hamas rocket attacks, some of these folks worked for NGO‚Äôs doing humanitarian work in Gaza. Today‚Äôs media reports describe piles of bodies in Kfar Aza. The victims of Hamas‚Äô indiscriminate slaughter presumably include some of the wonderful, peace-loving people I met with. On the other side of the Gaza border, hundreds if not thousands of innocent Palestinians lives will be lost as Israel strikes back at Hamas. While I urge Israel to do everything possible to avoid and minimize the loss of innocent Palestinian lives, there will surely be collateral damage. Hamas has blood on its hands for these deaths too. I have profound disagreements with the Netanyahu government ‚Äì from its authoritarianism, to its undermining of the two-state solution, expansion of settlements and mistreatment of Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank. I consider the occupation of the West Bank untenable and unjust. I support the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people and will continue to push our ally Israel on these issues.

facebook,"Back from all day travel. I start by echoing a Jewish friend‚Äôs text to me: ‚ÄùI cry for each human life lost whether they be a Palestinian or a Jew. No Jew and no Muslim can celebrate the loss of a human being‚Äôs life.‚Äù Amen.

This should indeed be obvious to any reasonable, conscientious human being.

Having stated the obvious, sometimes it is necessary to state the apparently not-so-obvious: What is not so obvious to many is the following simple fact regarding this so-called conflict: there is one side occupying and one side occupied, one side beseiged and one side besieging, one side being forced into the world‚Äôs largest open air prison where basic human needs and rights are cut off making life unbearable if not unlivable, and one side living comfortably receiving billions of our tax dollars on top of it.

In the life to life view of things, yes no innocent life is worth more than the other; in the assessment of the conflict, there is no parity between the two sides. Moral equivocation between the occupier and occupied, the displacer and the displaced, the oppressor and the oppressed is but an accessory to the occupation, siege and oppression that are at the ‚Äúroot problem‚Äù of this conflict, and a master-spin campaign to victim-blame and whitewash the perpetrator. Americans who once had grievances against the British and took arms when oppressed know this more than anyone.

I add that if you are just remembering that every life matters today, but not last week, or last month, or last decade when Palestinians regularly lost lives to indiscriminate and arbitrary attacks or repressive policies then your morality today comes off as disingenuous and selective.

Violence is ugly, all of it. Gaslighting is also ugly. Double standards are ugly. For me this is not about team or tribe, never was. It‚Äôs about being fair even to those we deem week and dispensable - in this case the Palestinians. That is why I advocate for justice for Palestinians - because they are an oppressed people. Fair-minded Jews and Christians are right by my side.

The common canard that Palestinians inherently eschew violence, are pretending to be victims, put up human shields to bait the good ol‚Äô IDF, and must be oppressed because they can never be levelled with are all rooted in a racist dehumanizing campaign repeated by almost every Israeli prime minister and spokesperson. 

Palestinians are fighting for their freedom and dignity. And guess what: they wish they didn‚Äôt have to. They wish they could lounge in cushy malls instead - like you. That is the truth whether you like it or not. Ask yourself why that is easy to understand with Ukrainians or other White groups contemporaneously and historically, but never with Brown and Black ones.  

I really hope that we, the American people, can wake up and stop being fodder - witting or unwitting - for propaganda. That we can push our officials to work for peace between fellow human beings, instead of parroting dumbed-down gimmicky canards, and to understand that peace can only be rooted in justice. 

Praying for true peace.",,283,"{'like_count': 163, 'comment_count': 7, 'num_users': 932167}",Suhaib Webb,,2023-10-08 10:14:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352749931_1366532574063207_7438285901386689440_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tMCW21oFNioAX97mxqc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBtSmopBdkDcnoK9TXhpkGNImS82tT5Y_9WmXE4GPj5lw&oe=6559BBA7,https://www.facebook.com/100044253768220/posts/883151423169975,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387738099_10158956165926065_5433459020627411731_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=a5DHWtaJfhsAX8bAUud&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBRLRSal95z7VINhvGZyN7XlYRr9d05_IUonAH0366xDQ&oe=655B2B03

facebook,"War is hell. I‚Äôve experienced it firsthand throughout my time in the Marine Corps and multiple deployments. I have seen the death and destruction that it creates and felt its lasting effects long after returning home. In war, there are no winners. None. I believe that at the very core of who I am. And so I am left to ask, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Why do some feel like conflict is the only solution? The United States is a nation born of many values - the best of which we continue to hold dear in America. Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and freedom. These values are not afforded to the Palestinian people and I remain resolute in my belief that the Palestinian people deserve the same rights that we are afforded in America. To be clear, my support for Palestine is just that. I support Palestinian self-determination because I am pro-humanitarian and anti-extremism, both at home and abroad. I do not subscribe to the belief that opposing the subjugation of Palestinians equates to being anti-Jewish. I am joined in that belief by hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis who support Palestinian independence and even more Muslims and Christians here in America who are proud to call Jewish men and women our brothers and sisters. I am proud to count myself among them. When international conflicts of this magnitude are taking place, we see others run to the quickest and easiest soundbites to try and make their point on social media and beyond. It does an incredible injustice to the nuance and reality of what is happening in real time. I won‚Äôt allow it here. The loss of innocent lives - no matter one‚Äôs race, religion, or country of origin - is and always will be unacceptable. Any role that the United States seeks to play in this conflict should seek to minimize the loss of life and must only come through diplomatic measures - not through the provision of military aid, equipment, or funding. To be sure, the quickest way to end this violence is to end the illegal occupation and apartheid of Palestine and the Palestinian people. The United States can and should play a role in brokering that peace - a peace that must bring justice and equality to all people. It is in this pursuit of justice and peace that lies the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù None of us - not a single one of us - would accept the life that is forced upon the Palestinian people. An inability to vote. An inability to access healthcare. An inability to see your family. An inability to travel freely or leave your home. Forced to walk on the other side of the street. Unable to pray in your house of worship - or worse still, murdered while you‚Äôre praying within it. The fear of waking up one day and having your home taken from you without rhyme or reason. Paying taxes without representation in the government that dictates your standard of living and quality of life. 1776 is calling - Americans would never accept what the Palestinians are forced to endure. So why do we sit silent and turn a blind eye? There are some that want you to believe that the actions that has taken place over the last few days are unprovoked. I reject this attempt to further turn international sentiment against the Palestinian people. For decades, the international community seems to have lost its tongue. To ignore the facts that have led up to these events - facts that have been playing out before our very eyes for decades - will further jeopardize the response of the international community, and risk the potential of further inflaming events in the region. I love the United States and the opportunities that it provides to all who live here. We cannot run from or ignore our history and the fact that the United States was founded on violence and bloodshed. That founding is glorified in our textbooks, at events and political rallies throughout the country today, on t-shirts and flags, and across social media. Why then do we clutch our pearls in disgust when others seek to achieve their freedoms through the same means and methodology? We are a country born of revolution. It‚Äôs illogical to believe we are and will be the only ones. I will always condemn violence and the loss of life. I hate war and the death and destruction that it brings and the profiteering that is enjoyed by the military industrial complex. The Palestinian people seek to live in freedom, and I believe it‚Äôs time to end the occupation to bring about a just and lasting peace in the region.",,271,"{'like_count': 71, 'comment_count': 39, 'num_users': 4851}",David Knezek,,2023-10-08 20:12:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271437578_4937982156264400_6002785672231786122_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=BRb6CC9Qy04AX_aV7F5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAsL6kWZ4-q2bGOVDO2W11KdUNbqsB37drVWwiXwKL98Q&oe=6559F8A9,https://www.facebook.com/100093487542625/posts/192608270532090,

facebook,"Remembering Josef Franti≈°ek and the Czech WW2 fighter pilots serving in Polish Squadrons A daring airman who became the highest-scoring RAF ace during the Battle of Britain. He was a Czech in service with the Polish 303 Squadron. His name was Josef Franti≈°ek. 17 confirmed kills achieved in a month was an impressive score. Although he was a great pilot and a great marksman, he lacked discipline and showed an individualistic attitude which wasn‚Äôt necessarily something his superiors appreciated. In order to hunt the enemy alone, he would often separate from the squadron in flight. Throughout his duty, in the 303 Squadron Franti≈°ek remained loyal to his Polish comrades. When he was proposed to join a Czech squadron, he declined stating that ‚Äúhe is a Pole‚Äù. Franti≈°ek had a strong bond with Poland, as he was one of the Czech airman who left Czechoslovakia in 1939 to join the Polish Air Forces, and later defended Poland from the German invasion. Even though he perished during the early stages of the conflict, Josef Franti≈°ek is considered as one of the best fighter pilots of the WW2 era. Today is the 80th anniversary of his death. On 8 October 1940, he crashed his Hurricane while doing a low pass in Surrey. He was killed instantly. Did you know that Josef Franti≈°ek wasn‚Äôt the only Czech flying with the Polish squadrons during the Battle of Britain? At that time, except for him, there were three Czech airmen in service with the Polish fighter units. What is interesting is that they all were friends. Poles nicknamed them the ‚ÄúCzech Cloverleaf"". Wilhelm Kosarz was born in Karvina, Czechoslovakia. He moved to Poland in 1926 and became a successful sports pilot, flying with Jerzy Bajan‚Äôs aerobatic team. He was assigned to 302 Squadron. He was killed in action exactly a month after Franti≈°ek‚Äôs death, on 8 November 1940, shot down by a Bf109. Matej Pavloviƒá - a Czech airman flying with the 303 Squadron. He was killed in action in April 1941 over France, shot down by a Bf109. Josef Balejka ‚Äì the only one who survived the war. He flew with the 303 Squadron and after the war, just like many of his Polish colleagues, he remained in exile. Balejka returned to Czechoslovakia when communism was about to fall. He passed away in 2004. #WW2 #BattleOfBritain",,268,"{'like_count': 185, 'comment_count': 12, 'num_users': 29209}",Laguna‚Äôs Spitfire Legacy,,2023-10-08 09:16:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/295310772_479976260796593_3715108257037690519_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=HCsqAD-rSjsAX8osFlp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAzXivD0Tmo86dX__CL7QGnteK_W_vuFuJM59uwJcH-RQ&oe=655A2E3F,https://www.facebook.com/100063526693408/posts/812730387521177,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387836847_812730150854534_5609690474583542448_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=MMDYxyYjsC0AX9kzQvI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAs6hZ1_dkmtbLDyaCHEezGL_JeUtRMTYQWCVIPLCfTyQ&oe=65577F37
facebook,"Israel Declares War after Deadly Hamas Incursion: Death Toll Surpasses 600 Israeli forces engaged in intense street battles with Hamas militants on Sunday, following an unexpected large-scale incursion from Gaza that left at least 600 Israelis dead. The assault marked one of the most devastating attacks on Israel in recent history, hinting at intelligence lapses and jeopardizing the perceived invulnerability of the country's security systems. Hamas, backed by a barrage of thousands of rockets, successfully breached Israel's defense barrier and unleashed chaos on nearby towns and communities. Beyond the vast number of casualties, which the nation hasn't seen in decades, over 300 Palestinians in Gaza also lost their lives. The aftermath of the attack saw militants abducting numerous captives, including women, children, and the elderly, back to Gaza. It is believed that Hamas intends to negotiate a trade with these hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. Highlighting the gravity of the situation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the nation was officially at war and vowed retaliation. ‚ÄúThis war will take time. It will be difficult,‚Äù Netanyahu cautioned, adding that Hamas will face severe repercussions for their actions. On Saturday, during the extensive and shocking assault, Hamas utilized diverse means to infiltrate Israel ‚Äî from explosives at the border fence to paragliders and speed boats on the coast. Their forces spread to various locations outside Gaza, as far as 15 miles from the border, while concurrently launching rocket barrages at Israeli urban areas. Israeli countermeasures resulted in massive bombardments on Gaza, targeting 426 sites, causing large-scale destruction. The Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed 313 deaths in Gaza, including 20 children, with approximately 2,000 wounded. Simultaneously, tensions heightened on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where skirmishes with the Hezbollah militant group provoked concerns of a more extensive regional conflict. Despite the carnage, both sides seem prepared for prolonged engagement. Netanyahu urged Gaza's residents to evacuate, a call largely symbolic given the strict blockade imposed on the territory since Hamas took control in 2007. In a stark retaliation, Israel cut off electricity to Gaza, plunging much of the region into darkness. Hamas' leadership signaled their readiness for a protracted conflict. ‚ÄúWe are prepared for all options, including all-out war,‚Äù stated Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy head of the Hamas political bureau. Global reactions to the conflict have been swift. President Joe Biden expressed support for Israel, emphasizing its right to self-defense. In contrast, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi lauded the incursion, speaking directly with Hamas and Islamic Jihad leadership. The trigger for the attack, termed ""Operation Al-Aqsa Storm"" by Hamas, is believed to be multifaceted. For over a year, tensions have risen due to Israeli settlement expansions in the occupied West Bank and mounting violence from Israeli settlers. Furthermore, frictions surrounding the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, a historically sensitive site, have exacerbated the situation. As the region teeters on the brink, international efforts are underway to mediate, with Egypt playing a pivotal role, though initial endeavors hint at a challenging road ahead to restore peace.",,265,"{'like_count': 142, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 93289}",Belize Live News,,2023-10-08 13:46:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/323347673_719179332829420_5300813974315463983_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=aXewoOVb7DwAX-MR0Z6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD38upzzOQ96R9oDKJrC8KVyc2NUVRG3UjP0UXkc3JXiw&oe=655AEDEF,https://www.facebook.com/100064133798981/posts/733097245504729,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387036143_733095912171529_5993964770875269000_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=MP3wJ5guIsgAX-os0sh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB15-MMJ9KtMCWBUYNALQgmBsgzRJuYOmO_ZCtpOYNLPA&oe=652CC7D1

facebook,"If you don't let your negative emotion out it just eats you up from within, there is a growling dog within you for hours. The fire has to burn the fire, one just has to burn in the emotion till the fire dies down and becomes balanced. The burning of the fire, of the emotion, cannot be tricked out of one's system; there is no recipe for getting rid of it, it has to be endured. The fire has to burn until the last unclean element has been consumed, which is what all alchemical texts say in different variations, and we have not found any other way either. It cannot be hindered but only suffered till what is mortal or corruptible, or, as our text says so beautifully, till the corruptible humidity, the unconsciousness, has been burnt up. That is the meaning, it is the acceptance of suffering. If one is filled with 10,000 devils one can only be burnt up in them until they quiet down and are still, and the infantile demand on the analyst or anybody else, that he should redeem one with some kind of comforting trick, does not help. If an analyst pretends he can do that, then he is just a quack, because there is no such thing, and anyway it would be meaningless. If he tries to get analysands out of the suffering it means he takes away from them what is most valuable; cheap comforting is wrong, for by that you get people away from the heat, the place where the process of individuation takes place. Sitting in Hell and roasting there is what brings forth the philosopher's stone. The unconscious itself, as pure nature, has an inner balance. The lack of balance comes from the childishness of the conscious attitude. If you only follow your own passion according to its own indications it will never go too far, it will always lead to its own defeat. Inordinate passion seeks defeat. People who have an inordinately passionate nature, a kind of devilish nature, are lovingly searching for a human person, or a situation, against which they can knock their heads, and they despise any partner or situation in which their passion wins out. Instinctively they seek defeat. It is as though something within them knows this devil has to be hit on the head, which is why if one is friendly or weak, or understanding towards such fire, one does not help the person; generally such people walk out on you, because that is not what they want. The fire of the passion looks for that which will extinguish it, and that is why the urge for individuation, as long as it is a natural inordinate urge, seeks impossible situations; it seeks conflict and defeat and suffering because it seeks its own transformation. - Marie-Louise von Franz, Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology (Inner City Books 1980), pp. 252-254. The urge and compulsion to self-realization is a law of nature and thus of invincible power, even though its effect, at the start, is insignificant and improbable. - C.G. Jung, The Psychology of the Child Archetype, CW 9i: Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, par. 289.

The statement was wrong across the board: the U.S did not pay Iran anything. It helped to ease restrictions on Iranian money that had been frozen in South Korea, enabling Qatar to take control of the money and use it for humanitarian aid. In any case, the money has not yet been transferred. Still, it was a surprising decision to attack the U.S. government at a time when the country would normally be united behind Israel.‚Äù ~ Heather Cox Richardson, ‚ÄúLetters from an American‚Äù #Palestine #Israel #Republican #Democrats #MiddleEast",,239,"{'like_count': 167, 'comment_count': 19, 'num_users': 19501}",Jemar Tisby,,2023-10-08 12:12:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/281125952_455069263089720_5160711522596494181_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=kHHWXTW0nSgAX8LH0Ey&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDPLf8gW2EUccGgIjzuMwCnVNVpw7RjD2zRUwGgbWu8xA&oe=655A85AE,https://www.facebook.com/100057599492848/posts/772457764684200,

facebook,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel is ‚Äúat war‚Äù after Hamas militants from Gaza fired thousands of rockets and sent dozens of fighters into Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip in a surprise Saturday morning attack, during a major Jewish holiday. Israel launched airstrikes in Gaza killing at least 300 people and wounding nearly 2,000 others, making it the deadliest armed response in years against the Palestinians, according to Israel‚Äôs national rescue service. The response followed Netanyahu‚Äôs pledge to inflict an ‚Äúunprecedented price‚Äù against Hamas militants, The Associated Press reports. The Israeli prime minister called for a mass mobilization of army reserves. Hamas‚Äô surprise attack killed at least 600 people, injured 1,500 others, and its militants went door to door abducting Israeli civilians. The unexpected incursion is also reminiscent of the surprise attack by Egyptian and Syrian forces against Israel 50 years ago almost to the day, igniting the 1973 Yom Kippur War that lasted less than three weeks and ended with Israel‚Äôs victory.",,230,"{'like_count': 149, 'comment_count': 55, 'num_users': 13090753}",Voice of America,,2023-10-08 13:45:37,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352992991_178766095145684_5027481947854717491_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=18ZZdScV7x8AX_v3UtK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCA-0oRGDfzOgJKAktJbxD6u7JzyNcJUAbbN0bpHjZ8-Q&oe=655A6AC2,https://www.facebook.com/100064458353336/posts/708201368005135,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/12797793132795353174?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgdb.voanews.com%2F01000000-c0a8-0242-47ae-08dbc79ed149_cx0_cy6_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=voanews.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbF6GozJAmPU4SWA2Y1QNg7eHSXG0RUldJB8ZT4PephWmQ&oe=65245325

According to media reports, both Palestine and Israel sides are seeing increasing numbers of death and injuries, with at least 20,000 internally displaced people are taking refuge in 44 schools, including 28 designated emergency shelters, in all areas in the Gaza Strip. In complex emergencies and crisis like this, inevitably, oppressed people everywhere will seek protection and humanitarian assistance. Everyone deserve liberation, safety and equality, and the only way to get there is by uprooting the source of violence of the conflict. These unprecedented hostilities and rapidly mounting death toll underscore the urgency for all parties to stop the violence and ensure civilians are protected. All parties must adhere to international humanitarian law by refraining from deliberately or indiscriminately targeting civilians from both sides. MERCY Malaysia is deploying its first mission members on 9 October 2023, and is fully prepared to provide essential humanitarian assistance and collaborate closely with partners to respond effectively to the escalating humanitarian crisis unfolding in Palestine.

facebook,"Israel launches retaliatory attacks on Hamas Israeli forces clashed with gunmen from the Palestinian group Hamas on Sunday, 24 hours after the militants launched a surprise attack on Israel in which about 500 people were killed. The conflict was spreading, with fire from Lebanon into northern Israel, which the armed group Hezbollah said it carried out ‚Äúin solidarity‚Äù with the Palestinian people. Israeli forces responded with artillery strikes into Lebanon and a drone attack on a Hezbollah post near the border, the military said. There were no reports of casualties. The incursion from Gaza into southern Israel, the biggest in decades, could undermine U.S-backed efforts to forge regional security alignments that could threaten Palestinian aspirations for statehood and the ambitions of the group‚Äôs main backer, Iran. Hamas fighters began their attack at dawn on Saturday with a huge barrage of rockets into southern Israel, giving cover to an unprecedented, multi-pronged infiltration of fighters into Israel from Gaza, a narrow strip that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians. Hamas fighters killed at least 250 Israelis in clashes throughout Saturday and into Sunday, and escaped back into Gaza with dozens of hostages. According to Reuters, more than 250 Gazans were killed when Israel responded with one of its most devastating days of retaliatory strikes. ‚ÄúWe will take mighty vengeance for this wicked day,‚Äù Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday. An Israeli military spokesperson said operations were going on in eight areas around Gaza on Sunday, while Al Hadath TV cited the Palestinian Red Crescent as saying 18 people had been killed in Israeli targeting of two homes in Gaza‚Äôs Beit Hanoun district. Palestinian health officials said 20 children were among 256 civilians killed. Nearly 1,800 people were wounded, they said. In the north, Iran-backed Hezbollah said in a statement it had carried out a rocket and artillery attack on three posts including a ‚Äúradar site‚Äù in the Israeli-occupied Shebaa Farms, a slice of land occupied by Israel since 1967 that Lebanon claims. Israel responded with artillery fire on southern Lebanon. There were no reports of casualties. The escalation comes against a backdrop of surging violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a Palestinian authority exercises limited self-rule, opposed by Hamas that wants Israel destroyed. The West Bank has seen stepped-up Israeli raids, Palestinian street attacks and assaults by Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages. Conditions for Palestinians have worsened under Netanyahu‚Äôs hard-right government. Peacemaking has been stalled for years. Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said the assault that began in Gaza would spread to the West Bank and Jerusalem. Gazans have lived under an Israeli blockade for 16 years. In a speech, Haniyeh highlighted threats to Jerusalem‚Äôs Al-Aqsa Mosque, the continuation of an Israeli blockade on Gaza, and Israeli normalization with countries in the region. Haniyeh said: ‚ÄúHow many times have we warned you that the Palestinian people have been living in refugee camps for 75 years, and you refuse to recognise the rights of our people?‚Äù Bodies of Israeli civilians surrounded by broken glass were strewn across the streets of Sderot in southern Israel near Gaza. The bodies of a man and a woman were sprawled across the front seats of a car. Terrified Israelis, barricaded into safe rooms, recounted their plight by phone on live television. Senior military officers were among those killed in fighting near Gaza, the Israeli military said. Netanyahu‚Äôs office said his security cabinet had approved steps to destroy the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group, ‚Äúfor many years‚Äù, including cutting electricity, fuel supplies, and the entry of goods into Gaza. In Gaza, black smoke, orange flashes, and sparks lit the sky from explosions. Israeli drones could be heard overhead. Gaza‚Äôs dead and wounded were carried into crumbling and overcrowded hospitals with severe shortages of medical supplies and equipment. The health ministry said 232 people had been killed and at least 1,700 wounded.",,218,"{'like_count': 67, 'comment_count': 120, 'num_users': 136912}",Lere Olayinka,,2023-10-08 07:41:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/354081886_10223600107615694_7574404000766807583_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=qgbe3caawocAX-Ax7KQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBSJ6B3VR7wnLIb51jxMd7hNTaLWWSghyhh8vMUUTWRVQ&oe=655AC092,https://www.facebook.com/lere.olayinka/posts/10224310356451471,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387837456_10224310356251466_1988694096642138056_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=29zN7e8tYsgAX8h1z9f&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAjNwvqWcUbjX_qErEL10imTJu9AUX3PRemmE1Nld_Cqw&oe=652D9444

facebook,"""Ijebu Ode History"" Ijebu also known as Jebu or Geebu is a Yoruba kingdom in Nigeria. It was formed around the fifteenth century. According to legend, its ruling dynasty was founded by Obanta whose personal name was Ogborogan of Ile-Ife. Its contemporary successor is one of the country's traditional states. The kingdom was one of the most developed in the region with a complex and highly organized government. The capital is at Ijebu Ode where the Awujale has his palace. Counterbalancing the Awujale is the Osugbo (known as the Ogboni in other parts of Nigeria), a council of all free born, titled men that acted as the kingdom's courts. The Osugbo is divided into six groups based on rank, the highest being the iwarefa, whose head the Oliwa was the second most powerful figure in the nation. Also powerful is the Olisa, who could be described as the mayor of Ijebu Ode. The Kingdom was made up of several towns and stretches to parts of Lagos State and borders Ondo State. The state rose in power in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mainly due to its important position on the trade routes between Lagos and Ibadan. The kingdom imposed sharp limits on trade, insisting that all trade through the region be conducted by Ijebu merchants. The monopoly brought great wealth to the kingdom, but also annoyed the Europeans. In 1892, the British Empire declared war on the Ijebu kingdom in response to its barriers on trade. The British emerged victorious in the conflict and captured the Ijebu capital, burning the meeting hall of the Osugbo. As noted by colonial governor Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard, the British made efficient use of the Maxim gun during the conflict; when Lugard defended himself in response to criticism of the high casualties rates caused by Maxim guns employed by troops under his command during military campaigns in the Uganda Protectorate, he stated: ""On the West Coast, in the 'Jebu' war, undertaken by Government, I have been told 'several thousands' were mowed down by the Maxim."" After British colonization, the capital served as an administrative center for colonial officials as the kingdom was annexed to the colony of Southern Nigeria. Today, it constitutes one of the traditional states of Nigeria. The Ijebu kingdom is governed by a king and his group of titled elders, who usually are men of a higher status and of considerable influence. The council governed the region and had representatives of further devolved councils who no longer have any power. Since the invasion of Lord Lugard, these councils have continued to meet and advise the Obanta kings, their power, however, is largely ceremonial since the establishment of the colonial administration in their protectorate. The elders were known to represent their various villages and the will of the people, and are now not such a significant part in the ceremonial process. The elders were all given individual titles and the lead elder was given the title prince, although he was only ever to inherit the kingship in special circumstances. The traditional belief that governed the monarchy was similar to that of the Chinese Mandate of Heaven. The Ijebu Kingdom is estimated to be one of the earliest kingdoms founded in the African rain forest. Ijebu-Ode was originally a city founded by a leader from Ife. Like most other early states in the Yoruba region, they began to build a series of walls and ditches around the city, construction of these walls began in 800‚Äì1000 AD when the walls were called Sungbo‚Äôs Eredo. The walls extended to eventually cover the entirety of the Ijebu kingdom. It was massive with an estimated 3.5 million cubic meters of moved earth and sand and is among the largest man-made monuments in Africa. The evidence found is not linked to an isolated townbut to a kingdom‚Äôs large dike, a kingdom which was once functional and had at its disposal a high level of agricultural practice, an established pottery-making tradition, and possibly an army that triggered the construction of the Eredo. Further archeological works show the advancement of the Ijebu kingdom, the palace of the capital, Ijebu-Ode was shown to have the floors paved with ceramic pavements. People at the palace also seemed to practice astronomy with triangular pavements facing a true eastern direction; it extreme aligns to the movement of the sun from one solar solstice to the other one and worked as a sundial.

facebook,"Cattle Medial Ptellar Desmotomy: ========================== Patelar Desmatami Magic Operation Memories of the past part 2 Dr. Prakash Zambre, Nashik Bulls, cows and buffaloes rear leg arthritis/actually this disease (stringhalt) is commonly found in young or weak or weak animals. Stabilization of the bowl/patella in the back leg is a common problem between Indian cows and buffaloes. It is shown by temporary or permanent removal of its regular condition and difficulty during rear leg movements. This condition does not endanger animal's lives; however, it causes conflict, temporary disability which reduces economic value of affected animals. Animals become a burden to farmers due to Stringhalt problem of stabilization of both legs on the upper side of the patel. Many times, there is no timely treatment due to lack of skilled veterinarian for surgical treatment. Although, Patela has various signs of stabilizing upward, but resting is the most featured sign of lameness right after rest is this felangial turn that pulls the tip of the hooftop. Genetic, nutritional deficiency, excessive stress, external trauma, acute triceps muscle composition and morphological changes in the gutga-styple joint are the main potential components of the condition of Patela getting the upper side fixed without having a knee scrap. Cutting of mediocre ligament surgery near knee joints - Medial Pateler Desmotomy (MPD) is a surgical treatment for arthritis-dorsal patellar fixation. I never got to see the experience of this operation in college, there was no internship at that time My first posting in Animal Husbandry Department was published at Pavia (V) P.S Chandwad on January 19 and in May I got charge of the hospital for one month and a leader's cow's case came from Dugaon from a distance of 10 km. I was a little concerned because senior Dr in the hospital had bad experience of Patelar Desmatami on his previous post and hence he was not performing the surgery. Instead of accidentally cutting the middle ligament, the bull was walking on three legs because he cut the middle. Before the operation I gave the animal owner the idea of possible consequences and this operation was done and if the leg fracture was not cured, I would reopen after 3 days. When I was in charge, the cow was showing the same signs and the hair came back and I noticed that I didn't cut the middle ligament completely. At that time, there was an Indian Veterinary Journal (IVJ) in the Taluka Hospital and I read the article of Dr.P.E. Kulkarni sir in it and did MPD accordingly and the cow got up and started walking well and after that, Chandwad Chalukya along with other taluka, in a work campaign on Stringhalt. At that time Dr. Lala Gosavi was in DPAP, Nashik informed his work camp in his own jeep, went to Sinnar and did a large amount of bulls and buffalo patelar desmatami. Medial Pateler Desmatami which can be done by an open and clind (open or closed) methods of MPD's are performed in two different preventive conditions of animals (lateral recumbancy) and some also do animals in standing positions. To do Patelar's desmatami I tied all three legs together in a way that would make the animal affected feet touch the ground and pulled the back arm. Gudga joint - Tibia-Femoral-Pateler articulation area designed for surgery. 5-10ml lignocane hydrochloride 2% injected with local anesthesia between tibial crest and intermediate pateler ligaments. On the central aspect of the Stifle Giant; the craniel tuborosity comes the thumb-groove site that moves upwards the craniel border of the tibia until cranial tuborocity arrives. Middle ligament was discovered as it is the widest and thickest of the three Pateler skeletons. The boat slipped inside the level of the middle cocktail of Tibia in the middle and mediocre (medial) skeleton. Mediocre skeletons feel as a major cord. A small wire rip to use MPD's blind-closed technique - Medial Pateler ligament was cut with incision 11 number BP blade. Tincture iodine antiseptic applied on wound after surgery. I have cut the medial ligament several times using the number 1 blade (curved blade) after giving legal anesthesia Two interesting experiences about Stringhalt. One was a college student while the other was a Deputy Commissioner, Astana in Nashik. I have seen many debates, many times at government level in different accounts. Similarly, even when we were in college, we got to see different departments debates and them together. Once upon a time in Nileli village near Dapoli, an incident of cattle treatment. We three surgeries PG students and four department mates professors had traveled 24 hours to blue with luxury. There were 2 animals in the work camp, two of them were infertility, but the surgery seniors were angry that the medicines were given without inspection and sat in the bus angry. Shortly after seeing the Stringhalt case, we asked our senior deputation to go to the bus and told him, we got an answer in anger, (truncated)",,213,"{'like_count': 146, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 44180}",Haryana Veterinary Services Association,,2023-10-08 10:47:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/306751720_458274036343089_2714506630055253895_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CjFlJVVlegoAX8xupop&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBxC0ANwVv2wtKIUTbAmkEXc93R8dj_ErVLqThhDfvfQw&oe=6559ABD3,https://www.facebook.com/100064814886043/posts/712334924270331,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387090788_712335470936943_7502304112518575061_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=UtqDwZBqtRAAX824vag&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCdyRU4vheannJzy_N9SLXpkcXQdoySDVUJbtpcglLGNw&oe=65289017

facebook,"Tsunami That Ended Alexandria 365 CE The Roman Catholic book burnings, sealing of underground vaults full of ancient records, the Jesuit destruction of entire libraries is so extensive in the erasing of world history that most people would never believe that the Vatican Archives is a front, a lie, that the secret library is actually a furnace. A certain book escaped the Inquisition, written by Ammianus Marcellinus, a single copy of the manuscript, dated from 9th century CE. This historian relates a destruction so devastating it remained unmentioned by any other surviving records. In Marcellinus' book History of the Later Roman Empire he records that on July 21st strange thunder and lightning afflicted the sky over the Mediterranean. Then, during the sky rumblings and lightning the sea receded away from the coast, the Mediterranean pulled back away from the African coast and the people of Alexandria watched as dry land appeared where moments before was sea waves. A trembling was felt but the people stranded in ships stuck in mud and along the wharf where there was no water then saw fish and sea creatures stranded in the pools and mud. Others stared at valleys and mountains that had been underwater just moments before. Thousands of people went out in the mud and gathered the stranded sea life and were out there when the Mediterraean sea returned, over a 100 foot high and rushing back over 200 miles per hour. Capsized ships were seen in the returning wave. Thousands perished unable to flee from the returning sea. Ammianus relates that about 50,000 people died, that the city was flooded and he was convinced the disaster was not local but worldwide. In Alexandria ships were deposited on top of buildings inside the city's interior. Marcellinus wrote that the disaster afflicted the Aegean too and that in Greece ships were found in the hills still containing their dead passengers. Near Methone in the Peloponnesus Marcellinus personally visited ship that had been deposited in the hills of Geeece by the tidal wave. He wrote that ""...the whole face of the earth was changed by a mad conflict of the elements."" (Marcrll. Book 26 p. 333) Recall, sky thundering and lightning preceded the quake and continued through it. It is the position of Archaix that cataclysms are induced by a mechanism unseen in the sky, they are not natural events. Additionally, there is an obscure statement Ammianus made about the Great Pyramid.

facebook,"The Quechan (or Yuma) (Quechan: Kwats√°an 'those who descended') are an aboriginal American tribe who live on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation on the lower Colorado River in Arizona and California just north of the Mexican border. Despite their name, they are not related to the Quechua people of the Andes. Members are enrolled into the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. The federally recognized Quechan tribe's main office is located in Winterhaven, California. Its operations and the majority of its reservation land are located in California, United States. The historic Yuman-speaking people in this region were skilled warriors and active traders, maintaining exchange networks with the Pima in southern Arizona, New Mexico, and with peoples of the Pacific coast. The first significant contact of the Quechan with Europeans was with the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza and his party in the winter of 1774. Relations were friendly. On Anza's return from his second trip to Alta California in 1776, the chief of the tribe and three of his men journeyed to Mexico City to petition the Viceroy of New Spain for the establishment of a mission. The chief Palma and his three companions were baptized in Mexico City on February 13, 1777. Palma was given the Spanish baptismal name Salvador Carlos Antonio. Spanish settlement among the Quechan did not go smoothly; the tribe rebelled from July 17‚Äì19, 1781 and killed four priests and thirty soldiers. They also attacked and damaged the Spanish mission settlements of San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu√±er and Puerto de Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n, killing many. The following year, the Spanish retaliated with military action against the tribe. After the United States annexed the territories after winning the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, it engaged in the Yuma War from 1850 to 1853 in response to a conflict between the Quechan and Jaeger's Ferry and the Glanton Gang, after the Quechan had established a rival ferry service on the Colorado River. During which, the historic Fort Yuma was built across the Colorado River from the present day Yuma, Arizona.

facebook,"Sfinte Abraham, roagƒÉ-te pentru noi! Patriarhul se chema ini≈£ial Avram. Studii ≈ütiin≈£ifice √Æl considerƒÉ un nume ce rezultƒÉ dintr-o frazƒÉ, prin contrac≈£ie: ""TatƒÉl (ab, o desemnare a lui Dumnezeu) este √ÆnƒÉl≈£at (ram)"". √én momentul √Æn care Dumnezeu a √Æncheiat un pact cu Avram, i-a schimbat numele √Æn Abraham (probabil este doar o formƒÉ secundarƒÉ), pe care Biblia √Æl explicƒÉ printr-o etimologie popularƒÉ, lipsitƒÉ de rigurozitate: ""tatƒÉ (ab, √Æn sensul de ob√¢r≈üie) al unei multitudini (raham)"", raport√¢ndu-l la descenden≈£a sa numeroasƒÉ (Gen 17,4 ≈ü.u.). Avram, patriarhul noului √Ænceput Avram este considerat strƒÉmo≈üul poporului lui Israel ≈üi pƒÉrintele credin≈£ei. Privind la el, se putea vedea ce √ÆnseamnƒÉ, exemplar, ""a crede"": √Æncredere fƒÉrƒÉ rezerve √Æn Dumnezeu, chiar ≈üi atunci c√¢nd sentimentul, ra≈£iunea ≈üi circumstan≈£ele exterioare sus≈£in contrariul. √én acest sens au fost interpretate toate tradi≈£iile antice √Æn varietatea lor, √Æmpletindu-le √Æntre ele, astfel √Ænc√¢t prezentarea biblicƒÉ actualƒÉ (Gen 12-25) trebuie consideratƒÉ expresie a unei viziuni teologice ≈üi nu o cronicƒÉ istoricƒÉ. √én Avram s-a sedimentat ≈üi a luat formƒÉ o experien≈£ƒÉ de credin≈£ƒÉ plurisecularƒÉ. Aten≈£ia plinƒÉ de grijƒÉ pe care Dumnezeu a arƒÉtat-o fa≈£ƒÉ de umanitatea pƒÉcƒÉtoasƒÉ, cu obiectivul final al rƒÉscumpƒÉrƒÉrii √Æn Isus Cristos, a √Ænceput cu Avram. El a fost primul om cƒÉruia Dumnezeu i s-a revelat printr-o alegere dictatƒÉ numai de libertate ≈üi har, nu de meritele deosebite ale lui Avram, care √Æn ciuda faptului cƒÉ nu avea copii, a fost ales sƒÉ devinƒÉ strƒÉmo≈üul viitorului popor al lui Dumnezeu, cƒÉruia i-a fost fƒÉgƒÉduitƒÉ ≈¢ara, o mare descenden≈£ƒÉ ≈üi o binecuv√¢ntare √Æmbel≈üugatƒÉ. Avram avea sƒÉ devinƒÉ o binecuv√¢ntare pentru oameni: ""√én tine vor fi binecuv√¢ntate toate neamurile pƒÉm√¢ntului"" (Gen 12,3). √énceputul istoric Avram a trebuit sƒÉ-≈üi pƒÉrƒÉseascƒÉ patria, Urul Caldeii, ≈üi sƒÉ emigreze √Æntr-o altƒÉ ≈£arƒÉ, Canaan, care mai t√¢rziu va fi numitƒÉ Palestina. AceastƒÉ emigrare con≈£ine un sens ad√¢nc. Avram a fost chemat sƒÉ pƒÉrƒÉseascƒÉ ambientul pƒÉg√¢n √Æn care trƒÉia, pentru a se √Æncredin≈£a cu o disponibilitate deplinƒÉ ≈üi deschidere spre nou, pentru a se lƒÉsa cƒÉlƒÉuzit din acel moment, cu √Æncredere necondi≈£ionatƒÉ, de unicul ≈üi adevƒÉratul Dumnezeu. √émpreunƒÉ cu so≈£ia sa Sarai (≈üi acest nume va fi schimbat √Æn Sara, prin≈£esƒÉ), nepotul Lot ≈üi toatƒÉ averea sa, Avram s-a mutat √Æn Canaan, pe care l-a strƒÉbƒÉtut √Æn lung ≈üi-n lat ca pƒÉstor nomad, zƒÉbovind √Æn diferite locuri. Iar c√¢nd ocuparea pƒÉ≈üunilor mai bogate a dus la declan≈üarea unui conflict √Æntre pƒÉstorii lui Avram ≈üi pƒÉstorii lui Lot, Avram cu toate cƒÉ era bƒÉtr√¢n, a dat dovadƒÉ de mƒÉrinimie ≈üi a lƒÉsat ca Lot sƒÉ-≈üi aleagƒÉ pƒÉ≈üunile mai √Æmbel≈üugate, d√¢nd astfel un exemplu dezinteresat de depƒÉ≈üire a conflictelor. C√¢nd, √Æn fine, Lot, victimƒÉ a unui atac belic, a fost rƒÉpit, Avram cu 318 oameni a fƒÉcut o incursiune ≈üi l-a eliberat pe nepot din m√¢na a cinci du≈ümani, dovadƒÉ a puterii, bogƒÉ≈£iei ≈üi prestigiului dob√¢ndite √Æntre timp gra≈£ie binecuv√¢ntƒÉrii lui Dumnezeu. La √Æntoarcere, Mechisedec, regele-preot al Salemului (Ierusalimului), a adus omagiu patriarhului epuizat de bƒÉtƒÉlie, gƒÉzduindu-l, oferindu-i p√¢ine ≈üi vin, binecuv√¢nt√¢ndu-l, iar Avram la r√¢ndul sƒÉu i-a plƒÉtit lui Melchisedec zece la sutƒÉ din toate bunurile proprii, un semn, acesta, prin care deja strƒÉbunii viitorului popor al lui Dumnezeu manifestau respectul lor fa≈£ƒÉ de locul ≈üi regele Ierusalimului. Cel fƒÉrƒÉ copii, devine √Æntemeietorul unui popor DupƒÉ aceste evenimente, Dumnezeu a apƒÉrut lui Avram √Æn viziune ≈üi i-a promis sƒÉ-i √Ænmul≈£eascƒÉ descenden≈£a ca stelele de pe cer. Cu toate cƒÉ o asemenea fƒÉgƒÉduin≈£ƒÉ era de ne√Æn≈£eles, Avram nu s-a sim≈£it derutat, ci ""l-a crezut pe Domnul"", ceea ce ""i-a fost socotit ca dreptate"" (Gen 15,6). ""Dreptate"" √ÆnseamnƒÉ aici comportamentul ""drept"" sau adecvat al omului fa≈£ƒÉ de Dumnezeu: √Æncrederea √Æn el, √Æncredin≈£area √Æn fƒÉgƒÉduin≈£a lui, fƒÉrƒÉ sƒÉ hrƒÉneascƒÉ √Ændoielile, mai mult, √Æmpotriva oricƒÉrei aparen≈£e ≈üi chiar √Æmpotriva ra≈£iunii. Dar √Æntru c√¢t Avram, √Æn ciuda fƒÉgƒÉduin≈£ei cƒÉ va avea o descenden≈£ƒÉ numeroasƒÉ, continua sƒÉ nu aibƒÉ copii, √Æn nerƒÉbdarea lui a √Æncercat sƒÉ-≈üi dea de fƒÉcut, √Æn modul cel mai omenesc, recurg√¢nd la expediente ≈üi tentative de a grƒÉbi ≈üi ajuta √Æntr-un anumit sens √Æmplinirea fƒÉgƒÉduin≈£ei divine. Pentru cƒÉ Sara era sterilƒÉ, el a lƒÉsat-o √ÆnsƒÉrcinatƒÉ √Æn locul ei - un lucru obi≈ünuit pentru dreptul Orientului antic - pe sclava egipteanƒÉ Agar, care a avut un fiu, Ismael. Dar nu acesta era mo≈ütenitorul la care se referea Dumnezeu. Din cauza geloziei so≈£iei sale, Avram s-a vƒÉzut constr√¢ns sƒÉ o alunge pe Agar ≈üi pe pruncul ei, care s-au stabilit √Æn de≈üertul Paran, unde Ismael a devenit strƒÉmo≈üul arabilor. ≈ûi astƒÉzi este venerat ca atare de cƒÉtre musulmani. Avram devine Abraham Dumnezeu a fƒÉgƒÉduit un fiu lui Avram, de acum √Æn v√¢rstƒÉ de 90 de ani ≈üi so≈£iei sale de aceea≈üi v√¢rstƒÉ, ≈üi pentru a √ÆntƒÉri fƒÉgƒÉduin≈£a a √Æncheiat un pact cu Avram. √én cadrul acestei alian≈£e, cu perspectiva unor urma≈üi numero≈üi, i-a schimbat numele √Æn Abraham.

facebook,"The other day I started introducing Nike to a ""head down and stretch"" button, because she gets MASSIVELY pent up and upwards. Well, safe to say, she's REALLY enthusiastic about stretching now ü§£ (pic 1) Has anyone changed their riding trajectory because of their mustang's needs? I was a 3 day eventer, focusing on dressage and sprinkled in some extra fun stuff for an all rounded horse (trails, team penning, gymkhana, the whole shebang). Nike has come a long long way but I realized that she genuinely despises the arena. All of our conflict, all of our frustration, it's always inside a fence. I realized she was bored, she was frustrated with the same old same old. We switched over to endurance conditioning and I've never seen a horse gain so much confidence and love for riding so fast. Even now, we choose to work on our specific cues in park across the street from the barn, not the arena, and she is one of the most naturally talented and enthusiastic horses I've ever ridden. I haven't regretted making the switch once, even though my old discipline was a part of my identity.

facebook,"The United Church of Canada Calls for Immediate Ceasefire in Israel and Palestine: The United Church mourns the deaths and injuries already suffered and calls for an immediate ceasefire to the recent escalation in violence in Israel and Palestine. The United Church condemns the attacks launched on communities in southern Israel by Hamas, and the ongoing daily violence meted out against Palestinians by Israel's deepening occupation in Palestinian territories. Echoing the statement issued by the World Council of Churches, The United Church of Canada is deeply concerned about the risks of spiralling conflict between Palestinian armed groups and Israeli forces, which impacts civilians on both sides the most and only leads to further violence and suffering. ""We pray for the victims and the families of those killed, injured, and abused,"" said Rev. Michael Blair, General Secretary of The United Church of Canada. The United Church joins with all those praying for a just peace in the Holy Land and urges global leaders to work urgently for an end to the current violence, an end to the ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories, and a just and lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis.

facebook,"For the one who feels like you are in way over your head. The one who doesn‚Äôt know how to swim and stay afloat in this diagnosis, this marriage, this parenting role, this divorce, this caregiving role, this conflict, this battle, this bank statement, this season. Sometimes (oftentimes, in fact), no matter how hard we try to keep our head (and our heart!) above water, the current is too strong, the swirling and pulling of the circumstance too much, the water of our situation too deep. Try as we might, we are helpless to save ourself. We need a Savior. And praise God in Jesus we have one. Not only a Savior who saves us from our sin, but a Savior who steps into our everyday life, extends His nail-scarred hand and pulls us up. He lifts us from that which we feel will drown us and sets us on a firm foundation ‚Äì Himself. The solid Rock. And from this vantage point, we realize nothing is too strong, too much, or too deep for our God. And we rest in the beautiful truth that we aren‚Äôt called to swim through this in our own power, we are called to navigate through it in HIS. Our Savior will be faithful to carry us through, we simply need to reach out, take hold of His hand, and never let go. Hope you all have a great Sunday.

facebook,"ISRAEL DECLARES STATE OF WAR FOLLOWING GAZA ROCKET ATTACKS In a dramatic escalation of the ongoing conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Israel to be ""at war"" on Saturday. This declaration came after Palestinian militants from Gaza launched a deadly barrage of rockets and sent gunmen into Israeli territory. The Israeli military reported that approximately 2,200 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel, while armed terror groups used unconventional means to infiltrate Israel via land, sea, and even paragliders. Explosions resonated across Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and southern Israel, with some blasts attributed to the interception of incoming rockets. Air raid sirens prompted Israelis to seek refuge in underground shelters. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) disclosed that Hamas had taken ""hostages and prisoners of war,"" without specifying numbers. Israel reported at least 200 fatalities and 1,452 injuries, as per Israel's emergency rescue service and health ministry. In response, Israel initiated airstrikes targeting what it referred to as Hamas sites within Gaza. The Palestine Tower, a high-rise building in Gaza City housing residential apartments and media offices, was struck by an explosion and subsequently collapsed, as depicted in videos. The Palestinian health ministry reported 232 Palestinian casualties and 1,697 injuries. However, details regarding the locations of the deaths and whether the toll encompassed Hamas militants or Gaza civilians were not provided. Netanyahu announced that operations were underway to ""clear communities that have been infiltrated by terrorists"" and declared a call-up of reservists. The situation continues to unfold rapidly in this volatile region.

instagram,"[TW/ Violence] The bloody gunfight between the Israeli military and the Palestinian militant group Hamas is ongoing in many parts of southern Israel, 24 hours after the militants launched a surprise attack on Israel.

Hamas infiltrated Israel via the routes of land, sea and air. Israeli forces and hundreds of Hamas terrorists fought through the night in over 20 Israel locations, including two where hostages were being held by the gunmen, the army said. According to The Times of Israel, many of the killed people were civilians slain in theirs homes and in the streets. Meanwhile, India issued an advisory to the Indian nationals stuck in Israel.

The conflict's bloodiest escalation in decades saw Hamas carry out a massive rocket barrage and ground, air and sea offensive, that Israel's army, said had killed more than 300 Israelis and wounded 1,000. Gaza officials said intense Israeli air strikes on the coastal enclave had brought the Palestinian death count to at least 400, with nearly 1,700 wounded.

Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to avenge what he said was a ""black day"" for Israel. ""The IDF (army) is about to use all its force to destroy Hamas's capabilities. We'll strike them to the bitter end and avenge with force this black day they brought on Israel and its people,"" he said.

Hamas fighters fired thousands of rockets and breached Gaza's security barrier, attacking nearby Israeli towns and military posts. They also opened fire on residents and passersby. The group labelled its attack ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood"" and called on ""resistance fighters in the West Bank"" as well as in ""Arab and Islamic nations"" to join the battle. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group was on the ""verge of a great victory"".

Hamas released images of several Israelis taken captive.

Northern Israel saw mortar shelling from Lebanon, as Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah targeted Israeli posts on Sunday. Israeli military said that they have responded with artillery strikes into Lebanon and a drone attack on a Hezbollah post near the border.

instagram,"‚ÄúMajesty Surfacing‚Äù / Brown bears are generally solitary creatures, but when fall comes, and the salmon return to the Yukon's rivers, these nomads are forced to crowd into close proximity. Each one has their preferred fishing technique: some are divers, some pounce, others charge up the middle of the river, and some wait stealthily on rocks. In the case of Morris the bear, his preferred method was to ‚Äúsnorkel‚Äù with his face submerged in the river and his ears free to detect potential threats. Tensions can run high as the bears all vie for the best fishing spots. Keeping an ear out for any unruly neighbors while pursuing salmon is a clever way to avoid conflict. However, as threats like runoff, development, and disease from local salmon farms undermine the future of the once-abundant fish, bears like Morris will have an even harder time surviving. In order to safeguard Canada‚Äôs wildlife and its fragile ecosystems, we must protect wild salmon.

instagram,"Hamas's attack and the events unfolding since yesterday are unspeakable. We could talk about their cruel and criminal actions, or focus on how our Jewish-supremacist government brought us to this point. But as former Israeli soldiers, our job is to talk about what we were sent to do.

Israel's security policy, for decades now, has been to ‚Äúmanage the conflict‚Äù. Successive Israeli governments insist on round after round of violence as if any of it will make a difference. They talk about ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù, ‚Äúdeterrence‚Äù, ‚Äúchanging the equation‚Äù.

All of these are code words for bombing the Gaza Strip to a pulp, always justified as targeting terrorists, yet always with heavy civilian casualties. In between these rounds of violence we make life impossible for Gazans, and then act surprised when it all boils over.

We talk about ""normalization"" with the UAE and now Saudi Arabia, while hoping the world will turn a blind eye to the open-air prison we built in our backyard. Apart from the unfathomable violation of human rights, we've created a massive security liability for our own citizens.

The question Israelis are all asking is - where were the soldiers yesterday? Why was the IDF seemingly absent while hundreds of Israelis were slaughtered in their homes and on the streets? The unfortunate truth is that they were ‚Äúpreoccupied‚Äù. In the West Bank.

We send soldiers to secure settler incursions into the Palestinian city of Nablus, to chase Palestinian children in Hebron, to protect settlers as they carry out pogroms. Settlers demand that Palestinian flags are removed from the streets of Huwara; soldiers are sent to do it.

Our country decided - decades ago - that it's willing to forfeit the security of its citizens in our towns and cities, in favor of maintaining control over an occupied civilian population of millions, all for the sake of a settler-messianic agenda.

The idea that we can ""manage the conflict"" without ever having to solve it is once again collapsing before our eyes. It held up until now because only few dared to challenge it. These heartbreaking events could change that. They must. For all of us between the river and the sea.

instagram,"The death toll from the powerful magnitude-6.3 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks in western Afghanistan has tragically surpassed 2,000, marking one of the deadliest earthquakes to hit the country in the past two decades. Afghanistan, nestled amidst challenging mountainous terrain, has a history of enduring strong earthquakes, particularly in the rugged Hindu Kush region adjacent to Pakistan.

As we come to grips with this devastating loss, we must remember that death tolls tend to climb when information trickles in from more remote areas, where decades of conflict have left infrastructure in disrepair, making relief and rescue efforts exceedingly challenging.

Moreover, Afghanistan's healthcare system, heavily dependent on foreign aid, has suffered profound cuts in the two years since the Taliban assumed control, causing significant disruptions to the economy, including the cessation of vital international assistance.

In these trying times, let us unite in solidarity, keeping the victims and the people of Afghanistan in our thoughts and prayers. Additionally, please consider contributing whatever you can to support humanitarian efforts in this critical time of need.

instagram,"Canadian psychologist and conservative influencer Jordan Peterson has come under fire for urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to unleash ‚Äúhell‚Äù on Palestinians in Gaza when he weighed in on the ongoing conflict on Saturday.

Palestinian fighters caught Israel off-guard early on Saturday, firing thousands of rockets into southern and central Israel, while dozens of heavily armed gunmen stormed Israel‚Äôs south.

Netanyahu has said the country would exact revenge, as the death toll on both sides continued to rise.

Peterson‚Äôs remarks drew widespread criticism on X, with many accusing him of failing to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has seen Palestinians in Gaza live under a debilitating siege since 2007.

This is not the first time the personality has been criticised for his comments about Israel and Palestine.

In December 2022, Peterson faced a backlash after interviewing Netanyahu, after many pointed out that he did not challenge the Israeli premier‚Äôs claims or his knowledge about the history of the region.

The divisive influencer also drew widespread condemnation after videos emerged of him  accompanying Jewish groups to Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem in October 2022.

Al-Aqsa Mosque is an Islamic site where unsolicited visits, prayers and rituals by non-Muslims are forbidden, according to decades-long international agreements.

Israeli groups, in coordination with authorities, have long violated the delicate arrangement, facilitating raids of the site and performing prayers and religious rituals.

This plucky little bull survived a long and frightening spell on his own, trying to fend for himself after his mother was killed.

His saga began three weeks before his actual rescue. On 5th July 2023, the body of a lactating female elephant was found in Pardamat Conservation Area, in the Mara ecosystem (second slide). She had been fatally speared ‚Äî yet another victim of human-wildlife conflict that plagues this area. Given that she was still producing milk, she had clearly given birth fairly recently. However, her baby was nowhere to be found, leading everyone to fear the worst.

instagram,"Ways to pray for Israelis and Palestinians. 

You can support Israel‚Äôs efforts of defense, while praying for both people groups. The terrorist attacks can be condemned while the verbal attacks against all Palestinians can be abstained from. 

People living in Palestine do not get to choose where they live. Many did not get to choose when Hamas terrorist took over. Hamas has harmed Palestinians as well. They are terrorists. This is nothing like a peaceful democracy where everyone got to vote them in. Remember that when you pray for the Palestinians as well and those living daily under their reign.

Israel is defending themselves from terrorism. 

Regardless of where you stand theologically, you can pray for these people who are without Christ on all sides. 

Getting to visit Israel through @passagesisrael was unforgettable. I learned so much and meeting the people who actually love there vastly changed my perspective on the Israeli Palestinian conflict.

The only thing we can be certain about the future is that many, many people are about to die. How can we begin to think about such a nightmare?

Israel said it is now at war with Hamas and launched airstrikes in Gaza, vowing to inflict an ‚Äúunprecedented price.‚Äù

Israeli soldiers battled Hamas fighters in the streets of southern Israel on Sunday and launched retaliation strikes that leveled buildings in Gaza, while in northern Israel a brief exchange of strikes with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group raised fears of a broader conflict.

Israel is currently in distress after a conflict between them and Palestine began when multiple rockets were launched from different locations by Hamas. Now, as per the latest update from her team, the actor has successfully reached airport area which is comparatively safer and soon she will be boarding flight out of Israel.

India TV team reached Nushrratt's house and talked to her mother Tasneem. She said that her daughter is coming back and is safe. ''We are very happy,'' she said. 

Apart from this, India TV got in touch with the actor's team and found out the current status of Nushrratt. ''We have finally managed to get in touch with Nushrratt and with the help of the Embassy, she is being safely brought back home. We did not get a direct flight so she is on a connecting flight home. For her further safety, more details cannot be shared but as soon as she lands in India, we will inform you. We are relieved and thank god that she is safe and on her way to India,'' statement from Nushrratt's team reads.

Earlier, it was reported that the last conversation that took place between the actor and her team was in the afternoon when Nushrratt told that she was in the basement with everyone.

instagram,"Caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani on Sunday said Pakistan is deeply concerned by the escalating hostility in the Middle East and the loss of innocent lives.  In a tweet, he said we stand in solidarity with Palestinians and call for an immediate end to the violence and oppression by Israeli occupation forces.  Jalil Abbas Jilani said a viable and sovereign State of Palestine must be established on the basis of pre-1967 borders and UN resolutions.

  He said the international community needs to intervene to bring an end to the conflict, protect civilians, and work towards a lasting peace in the Middle East.  Fighting between Israeli forces and the Palestinian group Hamas raged Sunday, with hundreds killed on both sides after a surprise attack on Israel prompted Benjamin Netanyahu to warn they were ‚Äúembarking on a long and difficult war‚Äù. The conflict‚Äôs bloodiest escalation in decades saw Hamas carry out a massive rocket barrage and ground, air and sea offensive early Saturday that Israel‚Äôs army said had killed more than 200 Israelis and wounded 1,000.

""Give 'em hell [Netanyahu]... Enough is enough,"" Peterson posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, after Palestinian fighters in Gaza launched an unprecedented attack against Israel.

Palestinian fighters caught Israel off-guard early on Saturday, firing thousands of rockets into southern and central Israel, while dozens of heavily armed gunmen stormed Israel's south. 

Netanyahu has said the country would exact revenge, as the death toll on both sides continued to rise.

Peterson's remarks drew widespread criticism on X, with many accusing him of failing to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has seen Palestinians in Gaza live under a debilitating siege since 2007.",,10595,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 595, 'num_users': 650615}",Ashfaaq Ali,,2023-10-08 17:43:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/356618985_3042397335903667_6973633063023548061_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=q8VYBjaLdmMAX8Uc7wG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBnsF6IO2d4Vkukv90FS-XnAuS4FjT4Wc1gfdEbg4mpDA&oe=655A0482,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyJYpn8PT4P/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387268209_1040480860304728_6140252781822444637_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=DbhTb1KVE3EAX8nrRJO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCSt2qb_DIrQ-yi22wpbbvg5arM4Dv6hva-mD9GVY3imQ&oe=65321B20

This comes after Hamas on Saturday, October 7, infiltrated southern Israel, sending fighters, firing 5,000 rockets, and taking captives, including women, children, and the elderly, which prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn of ‚Äúa long and difficult war‚Äú.

Israeli media reported that the Hamas attack on the country‚Äôs south has resulted in the deaths of 350 people, 1,800 injured, and 750 missing.

According to Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, at least 313 people, including 20 children have been killed and 1,990 injured so far due to Israeli attacks.

The conflict is escalating, with Hezbollah claiming responsibility for firing from Lebanon into northern Israel.

In a televised address on Saturday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will use all of its strength to destroy Hamas‚Äô capabilities. ‚ÄúAll the places that Hamas hides in, operates from, we will turn them into ruins,‚Äù he added.

Most important is that we all do our part, whether its physical battle, the social battle and most important the spiritual battle. We should be launching nuclear prayers to Heaven, for the God of Israel nether slumbers nor sleeps.

Hamas is an internationally recognized terrorist group , backed by Iran, whose doctrine-stated-mission is to kill every Jew in the world. To annihilate every Jew in Israel and dismantle the democracy. 

This is not a two sided conflict. This is a coordinated terrorist attack. The only thing that should be in your mind and heart today is compassion and prayers for Israel.

During Shabbat and in the midst of the Jewish holiday Simchat Torah,  the State of Israel was brutally attacked by a thousand Hamas terrorists along with the non-stop shooting of thousands and thousands of rockets all the way from Gaza to Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem.

Horrifying stories and videos of Hamas terrorists invading civilian Israeli  communities and villages torturing and murdering women and children and even kidnapping innocent civilians bringing them back to Gaza to be held as hostages or as a ‚Äúhuman shield‚Äù‚Ä¶.

These horrifying attacks that now has resulted in a war have been condemned from governments across the world. 
Israel, of course, has the right to and must fight back. 
And the revenge will be merciless.

Yet, I pray that this conflict will be short and that civilians and children won‚Äôt be targets in any of the following attacks.

instagram,"Once again, the world is witnessing a war where civilians pay the price for the short-sightedness and greed of their leaders.

The photo from Samar Abu Elouf of the New York Times shows children in Gaza yesterday looking toward the sky at Israeli warplanes that are bombing their land while they are unable to leave. For context on this ""war"" that is largely ignored by the US media, I recommend a report from Amnesty International about how Israel for years has violated international law by imposing a system of apartheid on Palestinians that violates their fundamental human rights. The report, which has been endorsed by prominent human rights groups around the world including many in Israel, can be read via the link in the bio.

To be clear, the targeting of civilians by combatants is a war crime and I condemn it no matter who the perpetrator. But there is a reason that I as an American Jew and millions of others have felt deeply disturbed by the failure of the Israeli government to live up to its promise. In short, Israel is not a democracy; it is an apartheid regime that treats Palestinians as an inferior racial group defined by their status as Arabs and non-Jews. The country's laws enshrine discrimination. Palestinians are not allowed either citizenship or nationality. This is not dissimilar to what the US government did to deny freedoms to blacks and other people of color until our own system of legalized apartheid was dismantled. 

Amnesty documents how Israel targets Palestinians by engaging in unlawful killings, detention without trial, massive land theft, and forced displacement and statelessness. To cite one example of the brutality, in 2019 Israeli snipers killed 214 Palestinian civilians including 46 children when they protested near the fence that makes Gaza the world's largest open-air prison. Two million people, including the children above, are trapped by Israel in a 25-mile strip of land.

There will be no hope of a sustainable peace if Israel's system of apartheid is not ended such that all living in that territory can enjoy equal rights under the law. Solidarity with all civilians caught in the conflict. ‚òÆÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è

instagram,"Kelompok Islam Palestina, H mas melakukan serangan besar-besaran kepada Israel, Sabtu (7/10/2023). Dalam serangan mendadak tersebut, Hamas meluncurkan sejumlah roket yang ditembakkan dari Jalur Gaza.

Melansir dari Reuters, militer Israel mengatakan bahwa mereka masih berada dalam posisi siaga perang saat sirine peringatan berbunyi di bagian Selatan dan pusat Israel, termasuk Yerusalem.

Menteri pertahanan mengatakan bahwa H*mas yang didukung Iran membuat ""kesalahan besar"" dengan memulai perang terhadap Israel. Militer Israel mengatakan bahwa mereka telah meluncurkan serangan udara ke Gaza. Akibat peristiwa ini, penyiar publik Israel melaporkan bahwa puluhan orang terluka dan dua warga Israel tewas.

Beredarnya video kepanikan warga Israel tersebar di internet. Kecaman dari para warganet serta beberapa pemimpin dunia segera muncul akibat hal yang mereka cap tidak manusiawi itu.

Namun Al Jazeera, sebuah platform berita coba mengingatkan dunia bahwa konflik ini telah memakan korban jauh lebih banyak pada tubuh masyarakat Palestina selama 15 tahun terakhir. Dari data yang mereka rilis, 6400 warga sipil/militer palestina meninggal dan 152.260 lainnya terluka, sedangkan dalam pihak israel sendiri ada 308 warga sipil/militer yang meninggal dengan 6307 orang luka luka. Tapi sebagaimana yg kita tau, perhatian lebih condong saat pihak Israel yang menjadi korban.

Dan rilis terbaru, Israel sudah membalas serangan pada Sabtu lalu dan menewaskan korban 200 lebih warga Palestina di sepanjang jalur gaza.

instagram,"President William Ruto has issued a strong condemnation of the recent attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas from the Gaza Strip. 

In a statement on Saturday, October 7, Ruto termed the attacks as acts of terrorism that poses a significant threat to international peace.

‚ÄúKenya joins the rest of the world in solidarity with the State of Israel and unequivocally condemn terrorism and attacks on innocent civilians in the country. Kenya strongly maintains that there exists no justification whatsoever for terrorism, which constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security,‚Äù he asserted on X (formerly Twitter).

Ruto reiterated that all acts of terrorism and violent extremism are abhorrent, criminal, and unjustifiable, regardless of the motives behind them. 

He further called upon the international community to swiftly mobilize and hold not only the attackers but also their organizers, financiers, and supporters accountable for their actions.

The Head of state also called for immediate cessation of violence.

""In consideration of the complex and delicate context of the security situation in Israel-Palestine, Kenya also makes a call for the de-escalation of violence and urges all parties to restrain from further military action, given its potential to intensify carnage and the suffering of innocent civilians, and to trigger heightened tension in the region and beyond,‚Äù he posited.

instagram,"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict may have been completely reshaped and taken into a new phase, analysts believe, following the massive Palestinian attack on Saturday that has left Israel in a state of total shock.

‚ÄúThis is an unprecedented strategic attack, the end of which is difficult to ascertain because of the unusual nature of the escalation,‚Äù Ameer Makhoul, a Palestinian analyst, told Middle East Eye.

‚ÄúEven if the Palestinian attack ends, its impact will be long-term and strategic, and will change the rules of the game.‚Äù

In the early hours of Saturday, scores of Palestinian fighters crossed from the besieged Gaza Strip into Israel by land, sea, and air, seizing control of towns and kibbutzim with shocking ease.

‚ÄúThere is a state of intelligence, military, and political confusion in Israel,‚Äù Makhoul said. ‚ÄúIt is the end of the doctrine of conducting the Israeli war in enemy territory.‚Äù

Hani Masri, a Palestinian analyst, said the current situation was a result of the ‚Äútragic‚Äù economic situation in the besieged Gaza Strip; Israel‚Äôs repeated attacks in the occupied West Bank, on holy sites and against Palestinian citizens of Israel; and its oppressive policy against prisoners, as well as the increasing possibility of a Saudi Arabia-Israel normalisation deal.

Masri also said that Israel might use the current situation to draw attention from its own internal crisis, sparked by the Netanyahu government's controversial judicial reform plans, which have split the country and sparked massive protests.

Israeli journalist Meron Rapoport told MEE that it was the first time since 1948 that something like this had happened and that it was worse than the Middle East war of 1973.

‚ÄúHow do people without sophisticated weapons - they have Kalashnikovs and ride around on pickup trucks, without helmets or vests - how do they get through the fence that is supposed to be secured by the fourth or fifth most powerful army in the world?‚Äù

Rapoport believed that the breach into Israel, which he described as ‚Äúunimaginable‚Äù, was a blow to its deterrence strategy and ‚Äúa complete collapse of Israeli training‚Äù.",,7487,"{'like_count': 7202, 'comment_count': 285, 'num_users': 1157344}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-08 03:29:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15258686_1293569957329919_8094586152507408384_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CJDb2hU5us0AX_v4NHq&_nc_oc=AQmhTNx9JSMKJ7ByPW-gAGlyTUGiK1GB9OxZLYVv7ZLpS0ddjuukWkjI1QowiM0WwAw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDM7VWUIVa31bFMO0RjUyWcPwhVRpDGdNt6sYzg3bsFBw&oe=655A8754,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyH25vLKvMd/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/387268355_253564520971567_5910224029556550429_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=rB_Cn32zvvMAX95i7UX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDnVrXktZTsBL5Ou6tq6ZKSEj-q1nIW6Eb03VvV_--CHQ&oe=652AF562

First, we pray with all our hearts for those grieving the sudden loss of loved ones, those who‚Äôve been captured, and those whose homes have suddenly been destroyed. ‚ÄúA voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.‚Äô Mat.‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠2‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠18‚Ä¨

Second, we pray for a miraculous de-escalation of this dangerous conflict. Terrible things are being done, thousands have died, hospitals are overflowing, many are suddenly grieving. Violence is provoking violence but we pray for reason to prevail over rage and mindless revenge. May Israel‚Äôs military response be decisive and appropriate, and may other nations with a vested interest in escalating this crisis somehow be restrained. ‚ÄúHe got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, ‚ÄòQuiet! Be still!‚Äô Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.‚Äù Mark‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠4‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠39‚Ä¨ 

Finally, we pray for active and effective peacemaking at an international political level. May the measured voices of diplomacy constrain warmongering on every side. ‚ÄúJesus said: ‚ÄòBlessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.‚Äù Mat‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠5‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠7‚Ä¨, ‚Ä≠9‚Ä¨

Please note that, in crafting this prayer, I have simply sought to find a few words to intercede for one of the most politically contentious and militarily dangerous regions of the world. I realise that many will object, saying that I haven‚Äôt gone far enough in one direction or the other. Such people must feel free to add their own, more particular prayers to mine. I accept that my prayer is inadequate. But these lands and these peoples clearly have a special place in the heart and purposes of God and so we must surely pray for them, without worrying too much about getting every word right, especially at a time like this.

instagram,"On Saturday, Gal Gadot used her Instagram account to share her thoughts on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has resulted in the deaths of several people.

Sharing a news article, the Israeli actress wrote, ""At least 150 Israelis have been murdered, and dozens of women, children, and elders are being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.""

The ""Wonder Woman"" star said, ""My heart is aching. I am praying for all those in pain.""

While hundreds of her followers praised the actress for raising her voice for the Jewish state, others accused her of remaining silent about the atrocities committed against Palestinians.

My heart goes out to all of the families and civilians on both the Palestinian and Israeli side caught in this horrible conflict.

I refuse to engage in any war mongering. This is a very complex situation that involves colonization, apartheid, land seizures, displacement of indigenous peoples, it also involves extremist groups on both sides and Hamas a terrorist group exploiting a very deeply disenfranchised population.

My prayers and thoughts are with the innocent families and children. ON BOTH SIDES.

""Give 'em hell [Netanyahu]... Enough is enough,"" Peterson posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, after Palestinian fighters in Gaza launched an unprecedented attack against Israel.

Palestinian fighters caught Israel off-guard early on Saturday, firing thousands of rockets into southern and central Israel, while dozens of heavily armed gunmen stormed Israel's south. 

Netanyahu has said the country would exact revenge, as the death toll on both sides continued to rise.

Peterson's remarks drew widespread criticism on X, with many accusing him of failing to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has seen Palestinians in Gaza live under a debilitating siege since 2007.",,5735,"{'like_count': 5586, 'comment_count': 149, 'num_users': 463756}",Ashfaaq Ali,,2023-10-08 17:43:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/356033199_631574228689784_5704324150278507301_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EJN8fUr9eZsAX82Y-Hh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDJxGn4wtu-xbiUc2h2LqGGbNe3qA3YuziQhOu7gMUhyA&oe=655B2DC1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyJYqoUvIkL/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387268209_1040480860304728_6140252781822444637_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SGz2Dnio6rkAX_Mks1O&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD8IO3G7Yq34gVcGQn_OEX0qET5TyexE-pqzQooL30zqg&oe=6553B960

instagram,"The bloody gunfight between the Israeli military and the Palestinian militant group Hamas is ongoing in many parts of southern Israel, 24 hours after the militants launched a surprise attack on Israel.

Hamas infiltrated Israel via the routes of land, sea and air. Israeli forces and hundreds of Hamas terrorists fought through the night in over 20 Israel locations, including two where hostages were being held by the gunmen, the army said. According to The Times of Israel, many of the killed people were civilians slain in theirs homes and in the streets. Meanwhile, India issued an advisory to the Indian nationals stuck in Israel.

The conflict's bloodiest escalation in decades saw Hamas carry out a massive rocket barrage and ground, air and sea offensive, that Israel's army, said had killed more than 300 Israelis and wounded 1,000. Gaza officials said intense Israeli air strikes on the coastal enclave had

brought the Palestinian death count to at least 400, with nearly 1,700 wounded.

Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to avenge what he said was a ""black day"" for Israel. ""The IDF (army) is about to use all its force to destroy Hamas's capabilities. We'll strike them to the bitter end and avenge with force this black day they brought on Israel and its people,"" he said.

Hamas fighters fired thousands of rockets and breached Gaza's security barrier, attacking nearby Israeli towns and military posts. They also opened fire on residents and passersby. The group labelled its attack ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood"" and called on ""resistance fighters in the West Bank"" as well as in ""Arab and Islamic nations to join the battle. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group was on the 'verge of a great victory"".

Hamas released images of several Israelis taken captive.

Northern Israel saw mortar shelling from Lebanon, as Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah targeted Israeli posts on Sunday. Israeli military said that they have responded with artillery strikes into Lebanon and a drone attack on a Hezbollah post near the border.

instagram,"Trying to find words is hard at this time. With every status, story or post the heart is torn and becomes heavier. The sights are truly horrific and the amount of pain and trauma being borne is unfathomable, as they lodge themselves deep in the raw spots of our personal and collective psyche.
 
All this brings forth immense emotional complexity for me. As I try to process and intellectualize what's going on, the ideological clashes with the emotional.
These events don't come from a vacuum. They're a result of decades of dispossession and oppression. Of land grab and military and settler violence. Of an engrained supremacy over another people and a prolonged hubris. A deliberate blindspot and years upon years of ""managing the conflict"" and controlling what is essentially an open air prison have blown up in our face and our nightmares become a reality.
 
It's clear that the Occupation must end. That said, I'm not here to give my personal political analysis, as I don't think that it's necessarily profound nor helpful at this time. It's hard to know how things will unfold over the next few days/weeks/months/years, but we're heading into what seems an era that will undoubtedly bring forth more violence, loss and pain. 
 
We're seeing innocent people being maimed, bombed and worse. War makes beasts of us as many seek revenge or retaliation. I encourage us all to dig under all this and find the humanity that resides in us, hold onto it tight and guard it at all cost if any semblance of a future on this land is to be possible. 
I know that it exists when I read the words of Yaakov Argemani, father of Noa Argemani who was abducted to Gaza calling us to ""Stop the wars, stop everything that we're seeing. Use emotion and only the emotion. They also have fallens, captives, mothers that are weeping. We are two peoples to one Father. Let's, with these words, with the Tanakh, let's please make peace, but real peace and I wish for this to happen.""

instagram,"We are extremely disheartened by the majority of reactions to our original post regarding this matter. Nevertheless, we have decided to repost with a neutral picture to avoid giving the impression that we are taking sides in this long-lasting and complex conflict. We fully recognize the intricacies of this conflict and do not intend to oversimplify it or pass judgment, as many of you do with the freedom to express your opinions. We unequivocally denounce violence in all its forms and are deeply troubled by how some justify violence with more violence, as if it could ever bring about a solution.

Typically, we avoid commenting on political matters. However, the recent attack on a psytrance festival by terrorists, resulting in injuries, deaths, and abductions among our friends and fellow attendees, compels us to offer assistance, condolences, and compassion. We firmly believe in personal freedom, freedom of speech, religion, sexuality, and political orientation. No one should face discrimination, violence, or abduction for making these personal choices.

We are absolutely shocked, heartbroken, and in agony over the recent terrorist attack in Israel. This attack targeted the modern way of life and personal freedom, and it is incredibly difficult to put into words the sorrow we're feeling about the attack and its many victims, including those within our subculture. We can't imagine what it must be like to run for your life from the very place where you were joyfully dancing. In the midst of all this, we want you to know that we stand with you, our community, during this difficult time.

If you're searching for missing friends or loved ones, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Despite the geographical distance, we will do our utmost to help, using our channels to spread the word and share information to the best of our abilities.

Intolerance and extremism have no place in our world, we wholeheartedly believe in freedom, expression, and unity. Our deepest condolences go out to everyone who has lost friends and family, and we wish strength to all those missing relatives and friends. May your loved ones return safe and sound.

I will focus on the innocent, peaceful, loving people in both Isra*l and Pal*estine.

A couple of weeks ago, the US agreed to the release of $6BN of Iranian assets held in South Korea (Iran allegedly finances H*mas). Yesterday, the US approved an $8BN emergency military aid package to Isr*el.

The system seems to be funding both sides. Because conflict perpetuates division and h*tred. And hatred fuels w*r. And w*r makes money. And the wheel never stops in a geopolitical game where innocent people on both ‚Äúsides‚Äù of each conflict are pawns and victims.

instagram,"‚ÄúGet out of there now‚Äù

In a televised address Saturday night, Israeli Prime Minister #BenjaminNetanyahu said the military will use all of its strength to destroy #Hamas‚Äô capabilities.¬†

‚ÄúGet out of there now,‚Äù he told Gaza residents, who have no way to leave the tiny, overcrowded Mediterranean territory, according to Associated Press. 

#Israeli soldiers battled Hamas fighters in the streets of southern Israel today (Oct 8) and launched retaliation strikes that leveled buildings in #Gaza, while in northern Israel a brief exchange of strikes with Lebanon‚Äôs Hezbollah militant group raised fears of a broader conflict.

There was still some fighting underway more than 24 hours after an unprecedented surprise attack from Gaza, in which Hamas militants, backed by a volley of thousands of rockets, broke through Israel‚Äôs security barrier and rampaged through nearby communities. At least 600 people have reportedly been killed in Israel ‚Äî a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades ‚Äî and more than 300 have been killed in Gaza.

instagram,"My heart goes out to all the victims and their families of the current escalation of this ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. 

Social media is not a place for nuanced discussions or complicated issues, so I usually try to keep my thoughts to when I can actually have real meaningful conversation with people face to face.

However, yesterday‚Äôs attack by the Hamas militants is something we haven‚Äôt seen yet. Perhaps because Hamas was never as successful as this, or perhaps just because violence and cruelty have a way of escalating where civility is allowed to erode.

Even in the surreal status quo of bloodshed and despair that we have gotten used to over the many years of conflict, there seemed to be some general rules, which have been finally crushed yesterday morning.
This was not just an indiscriminate rampage of violence. This was a planned and systematic slaughter, targeting helpless civilians‚Ä¶ babies, children and elderly included, followed by the cheering and the abuse of the paraded bodies in Gaza‚Äôs streets. The videos circulating in social medias are something that should send shivering chills in any beating human heart. They certainly have kept me up in a strange, numbing tempest of horror tonight. 

And while, of course there is a context for everything, and I am on the side that truly believes that the Palestinian people deserve to have their own governance and freedom, no context or ideal in the world can justify these actions. Moreover, I know as well as anyone, that these horrific acts of bloodlust and brutality only lead to a circle of retaliation and violence and loss.

It saddens me, and despairs me. I wish I could say that distance makes it easier. But my heart truly shatters at the level of cruelty and inhumanity of the past two days. 
To my family, and my friends, to those who have lost, to those who are trapped in this gruesome cycle, I send my condolences, I send my love and strength and above all, I send my heartbroken prayers for more peaceful times to come.",,4328,"{'like_count': 4328, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 101034}",Asaf Avidan Official,,2023-10-08 21:51:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/110070876_591938238428261_9058519968517363910_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=OuE2KJzX4mwAX-ksb6W&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDoyHBYh5K5UIni53m7AN4dhN_lyXNeZ2w7X2Dy0Aqaug&oe=655A6B07,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyJ08v9MyeB/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387675306_1307777753213755_4600877885127211057_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Gk9T53OmbroAX_wytRk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCCItMDxHqfmGvLPO9CGvDcJ2MiZ2DL7HezSSQP0ZqOSg&oe=655B2D66
instagram,"Keep in mind that Pluto entered Aquarius for the first time in 225 years in March this year.

This means that this is  a significant energy signature for the collective.

Historically this Pluto move has triggered revolutions in France and the US in the 1770s.

As we watch the Israel and Palestine conflict unfold under this Pluto alignment keep in mind that alone we are powerful, but together we are invincible.

It is not about choosing sides because that will just continue the karmic cycle between those 2 nations.

It is now about transcending violence, governments, and militaries but restoring power back in the hands of Israelis and Palestinians.

The people do not want war.

Governments, militaries, and corporations want war to accumulate power (Pluto themes.)

It is now time for the power to return back to the people.

The more united we are, the less violence our world will experience. 

Thank you for embracing your courage to choose unity over division. This is what truly changes our worldüôèüèΩ

Much love,
Sol

Here is what we know so far:

‚Ä¢	At least 250 Israelis have died in Hamas attacks, and 1,590 have been injured, Israel‚Äôs health ministry said. 
‚Ä¢	At least 230 Palestinians have been killed and 1,610 wounded in Gaza by Israeli strikes after the Hamas attack.
‚Ä¢	Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that the country is ‚Äúembarking on a long and difficult war‚Äù and warned Palestinians to ‚Äúget out of Gaza now‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	Israel fired barrages of artillery into southern Lebanon after Hezbollah targeted three Israeli military positions in the occupied Shebaa Farms. 
‚Ä¢	The US president, Joe Biden, released by Hamas against Israel, saying in an address on Saturday: ‚ÄúThe United States stands with Israel‚Äù. He issued a statement earlier calling the attacks ‚Äúhorrific‚Äù and an ‚Äúappalling assault‚Äù. The UN peacekeeping force has been deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border to ‚Äúmaintain stability and help avoid escalation‚Äù.

‚Ä¢	Netanyahu has offered a unity government after declaring a state of war. The move would bring Netanyahu and the opposition Yesh Atid leader, Yair Lapid, together during the national emergency.
‚Ä¢	The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, told the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, that ‚Äúinjustice‚Äù towards Palestinians is driving the conflict with Israel to an ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù, Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
‚Ä¢	The UN security council is due to meet on Sunday. The UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, condemned the attack by Hamas and urged ‚Äúall diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration‚Äù, UN spokesperson St√©phane Dujarric said in a statement.

""Absolutely horrific and heartbreaking.""

instagram,"High-level discussions between US and Israeli officials on military aid were already underway, a US senior administration official said, with an announcement by Washington possible as early as Sunday.

Biden described the assault as ‚Äúa terrible tragedy on a human level‚Äù and said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to underline his support.

‚ÄúI told him the United States stands with the people of Israel in the face of these terrorist assaults,‚Äù Biden said in a televised address from the White House.

‚ÄúIn my administration, support for Israel‚Äôs security is rock solid and unwavering,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make sure that they have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves.‚Äù

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reaffirmed Washington‚Äôs commitment, saying ‚Äúover the coming days the Department of Defense will work to ensure that Israel has what it needs.‚Äù

As the attacks threatened to trigger a wider conflict, Biden also warned ‚Äúthis is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.‚Äù

Biden stressed that Israel ‚Äî which the United States has supplied with billions of dollars of arms ‚Äî has ‚Äúa right to defend itself‚Äù after Iran-backed Hamas launched air, sea and land strikes.

The senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed it was ‚Äútoo early to say‚Äù whether Iran was ‚Äúdirectly involved‚Äù in Hamas‚Äô large-scale attack, but that there was ‚Äúno doubt Hamas is funded, equipped and armed by Iran and others.‚Äù

Meanwhile, top US diplomat Antony Blinken spoke with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas ‚Äî whose West Bank-based Fatah movement is a rival to Hamas ‚Äî and ‚Äúcalled on all leadership in the region to condemn‚Äù the attack on Israel.

instagram,"Bangladesh strongly condemns the ongoing violent conflict between Israel and Palestine, mourning innocent civilian deaths and injuries.

""We urge both Israelis and Palestinians to exercise maximum restraint and call for an immediate ceasefire to avoid further loss of innocent lives from both sides,"" the ministry said in a MoFA press release on Sunday, October 8.

The MoFA claims that UN Resolutions No. 242 and 338 underpin the approach, where the government supports a two-state solution, which would allow Palestine and Israel to coexist without occupation. This might bring permanent peace and stability to the region.

Bangladesh urges all parties to avoid excessive force and dialogue in the Israel-Palestine conflict, urging collective efforts for a lasting solution through diplomacy.

instagram,"At least 313 Palestinians have so far been killed in retaliatory air strikes by Israel in Gaza, according to Palestine‚Äôs health ministry, taking the death toll past 550.
The ministry added that nearly more than 2,000 have been wounded in the escalation of conflict between Israel and Palestine.
Earlier, Hamas gunmen carried out a deadly rampage in Israeli towns on Saturday, killing at least 250 Israelis, in the deadliest day of violence in Israel for 50 years.
The biggest incursion into Israel in decades could undermine US-backed efforts to forge regional security alignments that could threaten Palestinian aspirations for statehood and the ambitions of the group's main backer, Iran.
Hamas fighters began their attack at dawn on Saturday with a huge barrage of rockets into southern Israel, giving cover to an unprecedented, multi-pronged infiltration of fighters into Israel from Gaza, a narrow strip that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians.

In Gaza, black smoke, orange flashes and sparks lit the sky from explosions. Israeli drones could be heard overhead.
Gaza's dead and wounded were carried into crumbling and overcrowded hospitals with severe shortages of medical supplies and equipment. The health ministry said 232 people had been killed and at least 1,700 wounded.

instagram,"Statement

The Coptic Orthodox Church, headed by His Holiness Pope Tawadros II, expresses its rejection and denunciation of the events currently taking place between the Pal esti nian and Isr aeli sides, which have led and are leading - with all regret - to the lo ss of hundreds of lives and the inj ury of thousands, including many innocent civilians.

We affirm that vio lence only results in similar vio lence and more ki lling and dest ruction, so we call on all parties to resort to reason and resort to the language of dialogue and negotiation, in order to save blo.od and preserve human life, which is more important and valuable than other values and goals.

The Church commends the efforts to calm the situation undertaken by the Egyptian state between the two parties to the conflict to reach a political solution that preserves the rights of the Pal esti nian people and achieves the desired peace.

This was announced after Israeli PM #Netanyahu also said ""We are embarking on a long and difficult war.""

The IDF has issued specific instructions online for residents in 7 areas of the Gaza Strip to evacuate to predetermined points in the past half hour, likely a prelude to airstrikes. Targeted text messages are also outgoing. Via Osinttechnical on twitter. Due to lack of electricity and wifi in Gaza after cuts, it is unclear how widespread these messages will be received.

There is still fighting in southern Israel, says Israeli army spokesman. Via Reuters.

Airstrikes in Gaza began a short while ago again reportedly.

Israeli reservists are reportedly showing up to bases in the south.

Israel has declared the Gaza Strip a ""closed military zone"" and has ordered citizens to not enter the region.

Last night I received a very explicit voice message on IG and I played it for a family member who‚Äôs a girl, a girl like me who suffered from misogyny her entire life. We discussed why so many men in our religion & culture are obsessed with hating women. the stronger, the freer she is, the more they hate her. 

We pulled the Instagram of Shani Louk looking at her posts, just an innocent young girl who loved life, music & dancing. We cried watching the barbaric footage of how Hamas broke her bones & paraded her body like animals. We knew exactly why because we know how Islamists in our culture would immediately dehumanize any woman who dare to show some skin. 

There‚Äôs something fundamentally wrong with a religion that degrades women, we can‚Äôt continue to ignore the root cause of radical Islam, which is the lack of reform in our religion. Islam needs to be reformed! women need to be treated with respect regardless of how they dress, to be allowed to choose whether to be religious or not. Enough is enough!

‚ÄúWe condemn and oppose any assault on innocent civilians. But in contrast to the Israeli government that means that we oppose any assault on Palestinian civilians as well. We must analyse those terrible incidents in the right context ‚Äì and that is the ongoing occupation,‚Äù Cassif said.

‚ÄúWe have been warning time and time again‚Ä¶ everything is going to erupt and everybody is going to pay a price ‚Äì mainly innocent civilians on both sides. And unfortunately, that is exactly what happened,‚Äù he said.

The most right-wing Netanyahu government in Israel has been indiscriminately occupying Palestine lands and establishing Jewish settlements in the West Bank. So far this year, prior to this conflict, 248 Palestinian lives have been lost including 40 children.

The United Nations must ensure the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people for a Home Land, withdrawal of all Israeli illegal settlements and occupations of Palestine lands and ensure the implementation of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution for a two-nation solution. Palestine, in accordance with the UN resolution, with East Jerusalem as its capital must be implemented.

instagram,"Tensions have escalated at the Haitian-Dominican border. The Haitian border police took action to thwart the residents of Ouanaminthe from obstructing the bridge, a move aimed at preventing the resumption of trade in accordance with the announcement made by Dominican President Luis Abinader. 

Undeterred, the people of Ouanaminthe found an alternative means of voicing their dissent. They chose to block the main street leading to the bridge, effectively staging a protest against the reopening of the border for trade alone. 

This development comes amidst heightened conflict over the Massacre River's canal, prompting the Dominican Republic to take the drastic decision of sealing off its borders with Haiti. The situation remains tense, and the region is on edge as the border dispute continues to unfold ‚Ä¢

Channels Television reports the worst fighting in decades has killed more than 200 Israelis and wounded over 1,000, leaving bodies of civilians strewn on roads, while on the Gaza side at least 313 have died and over 1,700 were reported wounded.

In a statement on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yusuf Tuggar, said the escalation between both countries would result in an unending cycle of pain and suffering for the civilian population, advising that both parties should exercise restraint and prioritise the safety of civilians.

He urged both parties to create room for humanitarian considerations, calling for dialogue.

‚ÄúThe Federal Government of Nigeria, therefore, calls on both sides to exercise restraint, prioritise the safety of civilians and give room for humanitarian considerations. We are therefore calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue,‚Äù the statement read.

‚ÄúThe Federal Government of Nigeria is deeply concerned about the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in the early hours of Saturday and calls for de-escalation and ceasefire.

instagram,"‚ÄúWe are aware of a number of incidents‚Ä¶ in relation to the ongoing conflict in Israel and the border with Gaza,‚Äù the Metropolitan Police said on social media.

‚ÄúThe Met has increased policing patrols across parts of London in order to provide a visible presence and reassurance to our communities,‚Äù it said.

Britain‚Äôs interior minister Suella Braverman said there should be ‚Äúzero tolerance for anti-Semitism or glorification of terrorism on the streets of Britain‚Äù.

‚ÄúI expect the police to use the full force of the law against displays of support for Hamas, other proscribed terrorist groups or attempts to intimidate British Jews,‚Äù Braverman wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

There was visible security around one synagogue in northwest London, an AFP journalist saw.

The flare-up of violence began with a massive rocket barrage and ground, air and sea offensive on Saturday that Israel‚Äôs army said had killed more than 200 Israelis and wounded 1,000, with soldiers and civilians taken hostage.

Police in Germany and France also said they had reinforced security around synagogues and Jewish schools and monuments, with some supporters of the Palestinians taking to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the attack.

‚ÄúWe are aware that the ongoing conflict may lead to protests over the coming days. We will ensure that an appropriate policing plan is in place,‚Äù the Met said.

instagram,"Photo by @amivitale. Thank you all and @unbiodiveristy for the collaboration! I would like to conclude with an image from Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e) in northern Kenya and ask us all the question: If they have done so much with hope, resilience, and imagination, what might we reimagine together? 

 Reteti is changing the lives of both elephants and people. This extraordinary group does so much to rescue, rehabilitate and rewild elephant calves that are orphaned as a result of drought, human-wildlife conflict, natural mortality, and in rare cases, poaching. Here, Mary Lengees comforts one of the calves. 

Elephants are a keystone species and ‚Äúecosystem engineers‚Äù because they shape habitats in a multitude of ways. They are huge mobile composting units and create water sources in dry landscapes by digging wells with their tusks. They move seeds across huge landscapes and clear paths through dense vegetation that ultimately benefits other animals and people.We need them for our own survival. 
 
Follow @r.e.s.c.u.e @vital_impacts @amivitale to learn more about ways to get involved and help protect elephants.

instagram,"Here's the hard truth about love and relationships - they require transparency. 

Radical fucking honesty. 

But this can be a massive challenge when we struggle to be honest with ourselves, never mind another person.

Sex, communication, and boundaries....
All of these things can be radically impacted by how our shadow (what we hide or reject about ourselves) and how it show up in our relationship. 

But we do this for good reason. Often we are trying to prove/uplhold an image of who we think we need to be (or who we think they want us to be), or because the idea of being honest/transparent will lead to rejection, embarrassment, or conflict. 

For example:
We can get angry and act from a hostile place simply because we have felt rejected or embarrassed, but don't know how to communicate it. 

As I've said in many men‚Äôs groups, it's easier for a man to say ""Fuck you"" than ""that fucking hurt"" without turning into the victim or the martyr. 

Part of our work in relationships, and in life, is to begin to face the unsavoury aspects of our own internal nature. 

And this can be challenging because to do so is to risk looking and feeling like a damn fool sometimes. 

It's almost easier to stay in the comfort zone of sabotage and ignorance than it is to enter into the valley of the unknown and explore our deeper patterns. 

But this is also where we find the gold of life: strength, resiliency, self-direction and so forth. 

All of these virtues are crafted in our willingness to face our darkness. 

üëâThis is what you‚Äôll learn in the Shadow Course. You‚Äôll uncover the pieces you reject, neglect and avoid and start integrating them so that you can show up better in your life and relationships.

instagram,"‚û°Ô∏è Morocco has historically played a mediating role in the Israel-Palestine conflict, often leveraging its unique position as a moderate Arab nation with ties to both sides. King Hassan II, in particular, was instrumental in facilitating dialogues and meetings between key Israeli and Palestinian leaders, as exemplified by the 1995 gathering in Rabat with PLO Leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Throughout the years, Morocco has advocated for a peaceful resolution and the establishment of a Palestinian state, while also maintaining diplomatic and economic ties with Israel.

The conflict was spreading, with fire from Lebanon into northern Israel, which the armed group Hezbollah said it carried out ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people.

Hamas fighters killed at least 250 Israelis in clashes throughout yesterday and into today, and escaped back into Gaza with dozens of hostages. More than 300 Gazans were killed when Israel responded with one of its most devastating days of retaliatory strikes.

Israeli forces responded with artillery strikes into Lebanon and a drone attack on a Hezbollah post near the border, the military said. There were no reports of casualties.

instagram,"Women of Amfissa (c. 1887)
By
Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836‚Äì1912) 

Lawrence Alma-Tadema's ""Women of Amfissa"" (c. 1887) is a captivating historical painting that vividly brings to life an ancient Greek tale recounted by the renowned author Plutarch. This masterpiece depicts a poignant moment of moral significance.

In the painting, we see the turmoil of war between the inhabitants of Phocide and Amphisissa as the backdrop. However, the focal point of the artwork revolves around a group of Bacchantes from Phocis. These Bacchantes, having been enraptured by their nocturnal ritual dances in honor of Dionysus, have inadvertently wandered into enemy territory, falling asleep exhausted without realizing their location.

The morning light reveals the Bacchantes in a state of shock and fear as they awaken in the bustling market square of Amphissa, surrounded by their adversaries. The vulnerability of these women is palpable as they face imminent danger from the hostile Amphisissan forces.

Yet, the heartwarming essence of the painting lies in the response of the women of Amphissa. They gather around the weary and frightened Bacchantes, extending their protection and offering them shelter and nourishment. Their faces bespeak compassion and empathy as they plead with their husbands and fellow townsfolk not to harm these defenseless strangers. This remarkable act of compassion and the spirit of humanity prevailing over the ravages of war serve as the central theme of Alma-Tadema's ""Women of Amfissa.""

Through his meticulous attention to detail, the artist not only captures the historical setting but also conveys the timeless message of kindness and the possibility of unity even in the midst of conflict. The painting stands as a testament to the enduring power of empathy and the potential for goodness to shine through in the most challenging of circumstances.

instagram,"@dialecticsforliberation Pay attention to how the zionist propaganda machine and the western media will attempt to divert from the colonial reality of ethnic cleansing taking place by painting Palestinians as the main aggressors‚Äî hyper-fixating on their actions yet never scrutinizing Israeli atrocities.

Biden has already announced a $8 billion package to *aid* Israel in what will surely be an unprecedented retaliation to today's emphatic operation. To further pulverize one of the most densely populated areas and youngest population in the world which Israel already keeps blockaded illegally from the land, air and sea; where 9 out of 10 Palestinian children suffer from some form of conflict related post-traumatic stress disorder because of constant Israeli violence; where that trauma is unending and constant. 

But the damage has already been done, the dye has been cast‚Äî the illegality of their state has been exposed, their powerlessness in the face of those whom they oppress has been exposed. The fact that the Israeli state's existence necessitates the eradication of Palestinian people in order for it to function‚Äî that it can't abandon this purpose, has never been clearer. The normalizers and their collaborators were planning for a future that further betrays and invisiblizes Palestinians; they have stamped their right today‚Äî that the final say will be theirs.

Mainstream discourse will again make sure to contextualize Israeli actions in a rational, probable sense. But for the Palestinians whose right to life it violates, their retaliation to that violence imposed upon them will be unrelentingly criticized and deemed unjustifiable by all measures, as it already has been. They will present what is the result of structural genocide and systematic ethnic cleansing as barbaric violence when it is very much the byproduct of what the Zionist entity inflicts upon Palestinians every day. Their retaliation is inevitable; and it is justified by International law.

They seem to perfectly understand this self-determination within the context of Ukrainians resisting a Russian invasion yet they can't rationalize the same thing conceptually when it comes to Palestine.",,2172,"{'like_count': 2155, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 48746}",ANTICONQUISTA,,2023-10-08 03:59:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/14280505_2226585424146891_165877027_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Gqbknnwn_vQAX-9AqqH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAVnecwkfj2WbTsl74kwB8bwcgonf7ba1j2oWJ44Yxopg&oe=655AE1EC,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyH6W4kOCMI/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386755826_350580377315622_4221196766839928270_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=EhG2dJLQGc0AX8w35Dx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAbV30yTWb2VXHR9E7khkS9Nwp0ow5EbFvpFlQQ1CxAow&oe=65335AA0
instagram,"üéôÔ∏è International pop sensation Bruno Mars canceled his highly anticipated second sold-out concert in Tel Aviv's Hayarkon Park on Saturday, citing safety concerns following recent Hamas attacks in the region. Organizers, Live Nation Israel, announced the cancellation in a statement on their official Instagram page, expressing solidarity with the residents of Israel and the country's security forces during these challenging times. 

‚úàÔ∏è The cancellation marked Mars' decision to leave the country along with his crew. Israeli television presenter Guy Pines confirmed the singer's departure, stating that Mars flew to Athens and would continue his tour in Qatar after the cancellation.

üìÖ Mars had previously performed at Hayarkon Park on October 4 and was scheduled for another performance on October 7. Both shows were sold out, attracting large crowds. The decision came as a result of heightened security concerns due to the ongoing conflict in the region, leading Mars and his team to leave Israel on Saturday afternoon.

instagram,"A day after Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel with a barrage of rockets and a large-scale ground assault, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Palestinians in Gaza to ‚Äúleave now‚Äù as the death toll on both sides neared 1,000.

The conflict‚Äôs worst escalation in decades has claimed more than 600 lives, including that of a key commander, on the Israeli side, the government press office said, while Gaza officials reported at least 370 deaths, with thousands more wounded on each side.

Thousands of Israeli forces were deployed to battle holdout Hamas fighters in the south and the airforce again pounded targets in the Gaza Strip as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of a ‚Äúlong and difficult‚Äù war ahead.

‚ÄúWe are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack,‚Äù Netanyahu said on X, formerly Twitter, early on Sunday.

The reason you aren‚Äôt getting anywhere is because you take two steps back for every step forward.

You say you want something, but your actions tell a different story.

Lukewarmness is a game of the average life.

I am not a fan of conflict nor do I like to promote it and being that I live in Switzerland, I pay more attention to what is going on here in Switzerland since we do vote here every three months. However, as a Swiss-American, I am indeed a registered voter in the USA and do vote in the presidential elections. I think if you do have a voice, you should use it! Have a great Sunday!

Nushrratt Bharuchha, famous for her role in 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama,' had traveled to Israel to participate in the Haifa International Film Festival. However, due to an attack by the Palestinian militant organization Hamas on Israel, she was struck there. Her team lost contact with her.

""We have finally managed to get in touch with Nushrratt, and with the assistance of the Embassy, she is safely on her way back home. Since there were no direct flights available, she is currently on a connecting flight home,"" said Nushrratt's publicist, who also mentioned that her details were kept confidential for security reasons.

Nushrratt's mother expressed her relief, saying, ""My daughter is returning safely, and we are very happy."" Currently, she is flying from Dubai to Tel Aviv with other stranded Indian nationals in Israel. Afterward, she will catch a flight back to Mumbai.

instagram,"In the depths of an unprecedented ordeal, a stern and collective resolution reverberates through every street and home in Israel. As we stand, eyes wide open to the unspoken horrors that have unfolded before us, the longstanding spirit of mercy that has defined our actions has dimmed, overtaken by a resolute determination born from stark necessity.

There's a noticeable change in the air, a quiet but potent resolve, felt in the steady gaze and unwavering stance of every Israeli. We are bound, not by a common fear or despair, but by a shared, solid determination to protect our lineage and our future from the venom of unfiltered evil, and a shared heritage that has withstood millennia of trials.

In this conflict, so different from those past in its visible and visceral brutality, we stand unified‚Äîevery citizen, soldier, leader, and voice. Ours is a unity that forms an indomitable front against those who seek our tears, an unwavering collective force that pulses with a single, synchronized intent: to safeguard, to endure, and to triumph.

Our stride into this battlefield comes not from a place of revenge but from a sturdy assurance that such atrocity will never again cast a shadow on our land. And as we navigate through the sacrifices that inevitably lie ahead, our spirits are buoyed by the understanding that our cause, though drenched in anguish and outrage, is fundamentally anchored in the pursuit of a future free from the clutches of malevolence.

‚ÄúAm Israel Chai‚Äù now resonates as more than an affirmation of our survival. It‚Äôs a solemn vow that the future of the Jewish people shall remain unbroken and radiant. With leaders steered by the unwavering trust of their people, we sail through this tumultuous sea, eyes fixed on a horizon where our nation no longer wrestles with the ghost of relentless hate. In our steadfast resolve, we will navigate through this storm, securing not just our survival, but ensuring our future generations are untouched by such boundless cruelty.

instagram,"The government has issued a call for peace amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.

Expressing heartfelt condolences to the affected families in both nations and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured, Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Minister, Mr January Makamba, released a public statement through his social media platforms as the Middle East crisis entered its second day.

""We strongly denounce all forms of violence, recognizing that violence has never proven effective as a means to resolve disputes. We earnestly implore restraint to prevent further loss of innocent lives,"" the statement asserts.

""We urge all parties involved to seek a path to peace through genuine dialogue, underpinned by the support of the international community, with the ultimate goal of establishing two equally viable states coexisting in harmony,"" the statement further emphasizes.

The conflict between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants persists within Israeli territory near Gaza. According to the BBC's latest report, Israeli airstrikes have tragically claimed the lives of at least 313 people in the Gaza Strip, leaving nearly 2,000 wounded.

Meanwhile, Hamas' attacks from Gaza have resulted in the deaths of at least 500 Israelis, with several others held hostage.

Jedburgh is one of the four great abbeys established in the Scottish Borders in the 1100s. David I founded a priory here in 1138 and raised it to abbey status in 1154. The brethren may have come here from St Quentin Abbey, near Beauvais, France.

Augustinians were priests who for the most part lived a secluded and contemplative life, but also went forth to minister to the people.

Monastic life was largely routine. But the abbey‚Äôs border location meant it was caught up in the conflict between Scotland and England in the later Middle Ages. The canons had to evacuate the premises during the Wars of Independence in the 1300s.

instagram,"Actor¬†Nushrratt Bharuccha, who was stranded in Israel amid an ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror group Hamas, is on her way back to India. The actor was in Israel to attend the Haifa International Film Festival when Hamas attacked the southern part of the country. Soon there were reports that Bharuccha was stuck in the country with her team ‚Äòunable to connect‚Äô her. However, her team has shared a new update about the actor, revealing that she is finally on her way to India following the help of the Indian embassy. 

‚ÄúWe have finally managed to get in touch with Nushrratt and with the help of the Embassy, she is being safely brought back home. We did not get a direct flight so she is on a connecting flight home,‚Äù her publicist said in a statement.

Her team didn‚Äôt give any details about her present whereabouts because of safety reasons, and stressed that she will land in India soon. ‚ÄúFor her further safety, more details cannot be shared but as soon as she lands in India, we will inform you. We are relieved and thank god that she is safe and on her way to India,‚Äù her publicist added in the statement.

She visited the country for the 39th Haifa International Film Festival where her film Akelli was selected. Ironically, Akelli featured her in the role of a woman trapped in a combat zone, who had to battle for her life to reach home safely.

Earlier, her team had shared that the actor was in a basement for safety reasons after the situation turned hostile in Haifa. The team could not connect with her later, which got them worried. Her publicist had earlier released a statement saying that they were trying to get Nushrratt home ‚Äòin the best of health and unharmed‚Äô.

Over the weekend, the militant group Hamas of the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented, multifront attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets as dozens of Hamas fighters infiltrated the heavily fortified border in several locations and catching the country off-guard.

instagram,"Our special Exhibition ‚ÄûGermany at Sea‚Äú provides an overview of the 175 years of history of the German Navies. It is displayed on Deck 1 of the Museum until November the 5th 2023. One of the displays focuses on the importance on the development of the submarine weapon for the navy of the German Imperial Navy since the beginning of the 20th Century and during World War I. The display also explains the propagandistic dimension of the use of submarines during the war and also contains this astonishing model.

Submarine ‚ÄúU 96‚Äù, 1917
¬†
As late as the beginning of 1915, the German naval authorities assumed that the war would soon be over. Large U-boats, which took far more than a year to complete, seemed only conditionally necessary for a war decision. They were part of longer-term planning for a threat against Britain beyond a war‚Äôs end. Things turned out differently, however. The conflict continued, and by mid-1915 naval surface ships, except for a few raiders, were no longer present on the world‚Äôs oceans. The submarines were engaged in commercial warfare alone. Those of type ‚ÄúU 96‚Äù to ‚ÄúU 98‚Äù were ordered on September 15, 1915. They were boats of 837 tons displacement and 71.5 meters length. They carried six torpedo tubes and a 10.5 cm gun; their diving depth was 50 meters. ‚ÄúU 96,‚Äù commissioned in April 1917, sunk 31 merchant ships under the command of lieutenant Heinrich Je√ü and was scrapped at Bo‚Äôness in 1920.

instagram,"It‚Äôs not a mystery you perpetually end up in relationships that aren‚Äôt safe for you.

My expertise goes beyond my education and schooling.

I learned a lot of what I teach from having lived through it.

ü•∫I always thought there was something mysteriously wrong with me that I kept ending up with abusive people.

I blamed them.
I blamed my upbringing.

Both played roles in shaping my beliefs and behaviors.

üí°But the truth was, because of those past experiences, I lacked skills and supportive tools.

And rightfully so. I wasn‚Äôt in environments or around people that would show me how to be respected, feel safe or receive love in healthy ways.

The biggest misconception when it comes to healing from trauma, abuse, toxicity of any nature is that some talk therapy and somatic releasing will make it all go away.

It won‚Äôt.

I know that‚Äôs disappointing to hear but let me tell you exactly what many are skipping over in their healing.

‚ùáÔ∏èLearning and integrating the skills, new behaviors and tools necessary for preventing them from ending up in that same past situation.

Skills like boundaries, communicating, conflict resolution and repair.

You need it all!
Correct ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt a caption putting the other modalities down to prove something.

YOU NEED THEM ALL.
Cognitive and somatic. Lifestyle changes. Learning new beliefs and skills. Talking, releasing, learning, AND integrating!

There‚Äôs not a magic fix!

I did 7 years of somatic bodywork before I realized that wasn‚Äôt going to be something I can practically apply to trusting myself when it came to relationships.

It calmed me. It regulated me. It made me very in tune with my body based sensations.

But I still was thinking in extremes. I was not brave enough to set certain boundaries. I doubted myself. I felt deeply insecure relationally.

instagram,"The head of the African Union Commission has appealed for an end to the conflict between Israeli forces and the Palestinian militant group Hamas which has killed hundreds on both sides.

Moussa Faki Mahamat called on both parties ""to return, without preconditions, to the negotiating table to implement the principle of two States living side by side"".

""The Chairperson further calls on the international community, and the major world powers in particular, to assume their responsibilities to impose peace and guarantee the rights of the two peoples,"" Faki said in a statement posted late Saturday by the 55-member AU bloc on X, formerly known as Twitter.

He ""wishes to recall that denial of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, particularly that of an independent and sovereign State, is the main cause of the permanent Israeli-Palestinian tension,"" the statement said.

Hamas launched a massive offensive early Saturday against Israel, firing thousands of rockets aimed as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as its fighters breached Gaza's security barrier.

Israel's army said the land, sea and air attack -- which saw Hamas fighters shooting residents in Israeli towns and settlements -- had killed more than 200 Israelis and wounded 1,000.

Gun battles raged into Sunday morning between Israeli forces and hundreds of Hamas fighters in multiple Israel locations, while soldiers and civilians were taken hostage.

Gaza officials said intense Israeli air strikes on the coastal enclave had brought the Palestinian death toll to at least 256, with nearly 1,800 wounded.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday warned Israel was ""embarking on a long and difficult war"" and vowed its response against Hamas would ""continue with neither limitations nor respite until the objectives are reached"".

instagram,"Gunmen affiliated with the Palestinian group Hamas conducted a violent rampage through Israeli towns on Saturday, resulting in the tragic loss of at least 250 Israeli lives. They also managed to escape with numerous hostages, marking this day as the deadliest episode of violence in Israel since the Yom Kippur war that unfolded half a century ago.

In response, Israel initiated a series of retaliatory strikes that led to the unfortunate death of more than 230 Gazans in one of the most devastating days of violence in the region. The conflict persisted well into the night.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his determination for retribution, stating, ""We will exact powerful retribution for this heinous day."" He further characterized the actions of Hamas as the initiation of a cruel and malevolent war, acknowledging the immense toll it had imposed. He asserted, ""Hamas seeks to annihilate us all. This is an adversary that mercilessly targets mothers and children within the sanctity of their homes, even in their own beds. It is an adversary that abducts the elderly, children, and teenage girls.""

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh declared that the assault, which had commenced in Gaza, a densely populated area housing 2.3 million Palestinians, would extend its reach to the West Bank and Jerusalem. Gazans have endured a 16-year-long Israeli blockade, adding to the complexity of the ongoing conflict.

A policeman had opened fire on a group visiting an ancient Roman site known as Pompey's Pillar.

The reason for his actions are not known still, but the incident took place a day after the escalation of conflict between Palestine and Israel.

instagram,"The Holy Land, a place sacred to countless millions around the world, is currently mired in violence and suffering due to the prolonged political conflict and the lamentable absence of justice and respect for human rights. We, the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, have time and again appealed for the importance of respecting the historic and legal Status Quo of the holy shrines. In these trying times, we come together to raise our voices in unity, echoing the divine message of peace and love for all humanity.

As custodians of the Christian faith, deeply rooted in the Holy Land, we stand in solidarity with the people of this region, who are enduring the devastating consequences of continued strife. Our faith, which is founded on the teachings of Jesus Christ, compels us to advocate for the cessation of all violent and military activities that bring harm to both Palestinian and Israeli civilians.

We unequivocally condemn any acts that target civilians, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, or faith. Such actions go against the fundamental principles of humanity and the teachings of Christ, who implored us to ""love your neighbour as yourself"" {Mark 12:31).

It is our fervent hope and prayer that all parties involved will heed this call for an immediate cessation of violence. We implore political leaders and authorities to engage in sincere dialogue, seeking lasting solutions that promote justice, peace, and reconciliation for the people of this land, who have endured the burdens of conflict for far too long.

In our capacity as spiritual leaders, we extend our hands to all those who suffer, and we pray that the Almighty may grant comfort to the afflicted, strength to the weary, and wisdom to those in positions of authority. We call upon the international community to redouble its efforts to mediate a just and lasting peace in the Holy Land, based on equal rights for all and on international legitimacy.

On October 7, 2023, Palestinian militants attacked Israel. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were involved. At least 2,200 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip. Israel's government declared a state of emergency. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel ""is at war"". Palestinian militants infiltrated Israel and made their way into several kibbutzim and the Israeli city of Sderot. Israel Defense Forces killed at least 256 Palestinians. Both Palestinian and Israeli media sources reported that Israeli civilians and soldiers had been taken hostage by Palestinian militants. Northern American and most European countries condemned the Palestinian side for the violence, while some Arab and Muslim countries blamed the Israeli occupation for the escalation.

Some countries also called for a de-escalation of the conflict, after Israel launched air strikes and other military operations targeting Gaza that Palestinian authorities say killed more than 230 people.

‚ÄúWe are at war,‚Äù Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said when he vowed severe retaliation after Hamas‚Äôs surprise assault.

Here is a roundup of the reactions:

United States
President Joe Biden said US support for Israel was ‚Äúrock solid and unwavering‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe United States stands with Israel,‚Äù Biden said in a televised statement at the White House, flanked by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

‚ÄúWe will not ever fail to have their back.‚Äù

A White House official said talks with Israel on military aid were ‚Äúvery much underway‚Äù.

Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia‚Äôs foreign ministry said: ‚ÄúThe Kingdom calls for an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, protection of civilians, and self-control‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe Kingdom is reminded of its repeated warnings of the dangers of an explosive situation as a result of the continued occupation and deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights,‚Äù it added.

UN
The UN‚Äôs human rights chief Volker Turk said: ‚ÄúI call for an immediate stop to the violence, and appeal to all sides and key countries in the region to de-escalate to avoid further bloodshed.‚Äù

He said he was ‚Äúdeeply concerned at reports that Israeli civilians have been taken hostage‚Äù.

EU
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said: ‚ÄúI unequivocally condemn the attack carried out by Hamas terrorists against Israel.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is terrorism in its most despicable form. Israel has the right to defend itself against such heinous attacks,‚Äù she said.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said ‚Äúthis horrific violence must stop immediately. Terrorism and violence solve nothing. The EU expresses its solidarity with Israel in these difficult moments.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúNews of civilians taken as hostages in their homes or to Gaza are appalling. This is against international law.

The massive attack by Hamas militants is as bad an intelligence fiasco for Israel as 1973‚Äôs Yom Kippur War, when Egypt and Syria launched a joint offensive unforeseen by the country's vaunted intelligence services.‚Å†

instagram,"On August 9, a first information report was filed at a police station in Bishnupur district in Manipur‚Äôs Imphal valley. It recorded a woman‚Äôs account of being sexually assaulted by a mob in Churachandpur district on May 3, in the midst of the ethnic clashes that had broken out between the Meitei and Kuki communities.

The FIR briefly made news ‚Äì it was the first reported instance of a Meitei woman alleging sexual violence during the clashes. Until then, the only accounts of sexual violence that had surfaced in Manipur‚Äôs ongoing conflict involved Kuki women.

Since then, the investigators appear to have made no headway in the case, prompting the 37-year-old survivor to break her silence.

instagram,"As in the case of the Yom Kippur war, numerous analyses and investigations will be undertaken in the coming weeks, months and years on the intelligence, operational and political failures that allowed the Hamas attack to unfold. The assault was apparently initially undetected by Israel, and then for hours met with either insufficient or unprepared Israeli forces.

Similar to the 1973 war, the purposefully chosen timing of a Sabbath and the Jewish holiday of Sukkot provide initial, though very partial, clues to the breakdown.

Hamas‚Äô strategic calculations in launching the attack are uncertain at this stage. However, the assured severity of Israel‚Äôs retaliation against the group ‚Äì and as a consequence, the civilian population in Gaza ‚Äì makes it likely that considerations beyond just tit-for-tat revenge were at play.

Thank you to @flatiron_books for my complimentary copy.

About the book: John Alves, son of a famous Presbyterian martyr on the Portuguese island of Madeira, spends his childhood in jail and in poverty. When he meets Mary Freitas‚Äïthough the adopted daughter of a master botanist, her true lineage is the subject of dangerous rumor‚Äïa spark kindles a lasting bond. But soon their families must confront the rising blood tide of warfare between Catholics and Protestants. Fleeing with only what they can carry, John and Mary are separated and arrive at different times and places in a rapidly growing and changing mid-nineteenth-century Illinois.

Years later, John settles into his life as an educator at Jacksonville‚Äôs nationally renowned school for the deaf, and Mary is a gardener in Springfield for handsome, wealthy Edward Moore. After John and Mary reconnect, the home of rising politician Abraham Lincoln provides a prime setting for their courtship. But conflict looms on the horizon, and John is torn. Should he join the Union army to prove his loyalty to his new country, or should he stay to fight for the chance to make a life with the one he loves?

And should Mary accept Edward‚Äôs marriage proposal since he is a partner in her business of selling the miracle-berry fruit she transported from Madeira, or should she choose her passion for John? Social jealousies and betrayals compound the obstacles unleashed by the Civil War.

In poignant and lyrical prose, Katherine Vaz‚Äôs Above the Salt is a captivating and beautiful tribute to the power of true love and the sacrifices we make to harness it.

instagram,"Exclusive: Jonathan Stickland, the far-right leader of a PAC that has donated funneled millions of dollars to high-profile Texas leaders, hosted prominent white supremacist Nick Fuentes and other right-wing activists for several hours on Friday.

A Texas Tribune reporter and photographer saw Fuentes and other right-wing activists ‚Äî including Kyle Rittenhouse ‚Äî enter a small, one-story office building in a remote business park in west Fort Worth.

The office is the headquarters for Pale Horse Strategies, a consulting firm for far-right candidates that is owned by Jonathan Stickland. 

Matt Rinaldi, the chair of the Republican Party of Texas and a close ally of Stickland, was also seen entering the building while Fuentes was inside. Rinaldi has denied that he had any knowledge that Fuentes was on the premises.

Fuentes‚Äô appearance marks his most notable rendezvous with GOP officials since last November, when former President Donald Trump was condemned by leaders of his own party after dining at Mar-A-Lago with Fuentes and Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, who at the time was embroiled in an uproar over antisemitic statements he made that fall.

Fuentes‚Äô visit to Texas also comes as the far-right flank of the state GOP continues to elevate extreme figures, rhetoric and conspiracy theories, and as the party‚Äôs internal conflict continues in the wake of Paxton‚Äôs impeachment.

instagram,"Whether you‚Äôre a Zionist or believe Israel is an apartheid state, if you believe random women, young and old, and their children, being abducted, bombed, raped, murdered and paraded through the streets by men, is a justified response to oppression, then you are corrupted. Emotionally dead. It‚Äôs not brave rebellion. It‚Äôs plain old male savagery.

Too many people imply that the women on ""the other side"" of a conflict deserve whatever cruel fate meets them, simply because the male class of their society committed unjustifiable crimes. This is because every belief system other than radical feminism is male centered. It treats women and children as sacrificial pawns in men‚Äôs wars. Radical feminism, hell even just feminism, is about rejecting that. To be a feminist is to support, and have concern for, women and children first and foremost. On all sides.

My mind has been racing all day over this and I just had to get it all out. Please feel free to read this when you have the time, I know it‚Äôs long but I couldn‚Äôt simplify it.

According to media reports, both Palestine and Israel sides are seeing increasing numbers of death and injuries, with at least 20,000 internally displaced people are taking refuge in 44 schools, including 28 designated emergency shelters, in all areas in the Gaza Strip.

In complex emergencies and crisis like this, inevitably, oppressed people everywhere will seek protection and humanitarian assistance. Everyone deserve liberation, safety and equality, and the only way to get there is by uprooting the source of violence of the conflict.

These unprecedented hostilities and rapidly mounting death toll underscore the urgency for all parties to stop the violence and ensure civilians are protected. All parties must adhere to international humanitarian law by refraining from deliberately or indiscriminately targeting civilians from both sides.

MERCY Malaysia is deploying its first mission members on 9 October 2023. and is fully prepared to provide essential humanitarian assistance and collaborate closely with partners to respond effectively to the escalating humanitarian crisis unfolding in Palestine.

Turkish forces killed 58 Kurdish militants in northern Syria in overnight attacks on militant targets, the Defense Ministry said Saturday, as conflict in the region escalated nearly a week after a bomb attack in Ankara. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Turkey this week said all targets belonging to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, militia and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia were ""legitimate targets"" for its forces after the PKK claimed responsibility for Sunday's bombing in Ankara, which wounded two police officers and killed the two attackers. ‚Å†

Turkey said the attackers came from Syria. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF ‚Äî a coalition of rebel groups spearheaded by the YPG militia ‚Äî denied the accusation. ‚Å†

instagram,"We stand in solidarity with Palestinians & call for an immediate end to the violence & oppression by Israeli occupation forces: Jalil Abbas Jilani

Caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani has said that Pakistan is deeply concerned by the escalating hostility in the Middle East and the loss of innocent lives.

In a statement issued on twitter on Sunday, Jalil Abbas Jilani said that we stand in solidarity with Palestinians and call for an immediate end to the violence and oppression by Israeli occupation forces.

Jalil Abbas Jilani said a viable and sovereign State of Palestine must be established on the basis of pre-1967 borders and United Nations resolutions.

He said the international community needs to intervene to bring an end to the conflict, protect civilians, and work towards a lasting peace in the Middle East.

instagram,"Violence is not a solution.

I know that the UN will not take any action now, and they have not sent peacekeepers to Artsakh as this structure is no longer effective. Still, I will demand it, as this is not the last conflict; we need reforms and changes in international institutions and policies.

My condolences to all the victims of this long-standing bloody conflict. I demand an end to the terrorists and the apartheid in Palestine.

The far-right Israeli government has proven incapable of finding solutions. The same can be said for the terrorist organization Hamas.

Most international media cover just one side of the conflict without context, and it‚Äôs very harmful to the world.

When Israel organizes (and will continue, but now on a different scale) ethnic cleansing in Palestine, receiving support from Europe and the US, I believe many others will be ashamed.

Though not, since Islamophobia is the norm in white international media and civil society.

I understand everyone is emotional right now, but there is no excuse for any war crimes.

You probably don‚Äôt have any Palestinians in your circle, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay to justify bombing civilians in Palestine, no matter how horrible Hamas‚Äôs terrorist attacks are.

By doing so, you are inadvertently contributing to the spiral of violence, not solving the conflict. We need to demand peacekeepers and seek a solution to the conflict.

The Republic of Cuba expresses serious concern about the escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine, which is a consequence of 75 years of permanent violation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's aggressive and expansionist policy.

Cuba demands a broad, just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the creation of two States, which allows the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and to have an independent and sovereign State within the previous borders. to 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

The United Nations Security Council must fulfill its mandate and put an end to the impunity of Israel, the occupying power, with which the United States has historically been complicit, by repeatedly obstructing the action of the body, undermining peace, security and stability in the Middle East.

Cuba calls for peace and the search for a solution through negotiation that avoids a further escalation of a conflict that has already cost the lives of tens of thousands of people.  #cuba #palestine",,582,"{'like_count': 571, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 4512}",Cuba Solidarity Campaign,,2023-10-08 16:49:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/386919126_1380951619168009_370330816502694376_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CPfF4phayuMAX9XAf8H&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCjjztnqhPObleQzHQm1IGeJlbRIz43Z1v9ZxP4jHssHg&oe=655A10E2,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyJSfw7ILMr/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387269727_767172215216012_869141286982517278_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ohyAdDrGE1sAX_6YFTG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB2PCfRPdBOwv-VhwhBoS-11_RqPTyZ4F7e5CIxLwwalA&oe=655A2B4B

This increase in hostilities coincides with rising concerns of a potential ground invasion of Gaza, which have intensified since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning to transform the besieged Palestinian territory into an isolated area after Hamas's unexpected attack on Saturday.

instagram,"Hamas launched a large-scale attack on Israel on Saturday, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza, and infiltrating Israel‚Äôs border by air, land, and sea.

The Details: The attack caught Israel off-guard as the country is celebrating a major holiday. Hamas military commander Mohammad Deif said 5,000 rockets had been launched and called on Palestinians everywhere to take arms. Israel struck military targets in Gaza in response to the attacks. As of Sunday morning local time, over 300 Israelis and 256 Palestinians are reported dead.

For Context: Israel and Hamas have a long history of conflict, including an 11-day war in 2021 that left over 200 people dead. In January 2023, Israel and fighters in Gaza clashed over an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in Gaza. In September, the Biden administration pushed for stabler relations between Middle Eastern countries, with particular focus on Saudi Arabia and Israeli relations. This week, media reports said Israel ‚Äúquietly‚Äù armed Azerbaijan in its recent military victory over the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Key Quotes: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared mass army mobilization in a televised address, saying, ‚ÄúWe are at war. Not an ‚Äòoperation,‚Äô not a ‚Äòround,‚Äô but at war.‚Äù Hamas commander Deif called the attack ""the greatest battle to end the last occupation on Earth.""

The SPH also prays for the speedy recovery of the people who are injured due to the conflict.

Underground, 2023.
Natural and pigmented sand, debris glue gesso on cardboard box
30""x23""x4""

In combining movement with stillness, Mark Van Wagner‚Äôs artworks reference and combine various archeological, architectural, anthropomorphic characteristics, and various investigations of the inner and outer landscape. His sculptures often depict moments of impact and reverberations of force. 
The implications of conflict and ruin are present but so are humor and restoration, providing a sense of intimacy and introspection for the embodied subject.

Over the years, Van Wagner has collected natural sand from around the world and combines this substance along with flotsam and pigmented sand onto his layered-relief sculptures. In the exploration of applying mixed-media/assemblage into his artwork, he has recognized sand to be the most literal medium to capture material decomposition - its essence defining impermanence related to time, place and gross matter. Thick and thin spontaneous-gestural applications of glue adhesives and gesso are sprinkled with innumerable sand particles and debris over manipulated cardboard boxes. By reassembling the sand back into a concrete substance and onto his humble armatures his work playfully reminds us of life‚Äôs cycles.",,535,"{'like_count': 530, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 234750}",Arttyco Contemporary,,2023-10-08 18:14:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/42440415_514646192334930_5947346961160994816_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=r69acHwf5NsAX_mbrAp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDKO_JvJvtZyQvjL8KSmp68X7DjdSu5g94IiHkNOuDqfg&oe=655B15BD,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyJcM56tzIq/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/387834796_18262522492165855_4848480977385937376_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=zwzLKzlYi90AX9oZEtD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDPBN9BEURUDwgiXxB4AxslsrgepA83S6B-4PE_mEyEfw&oe=6534BF82

How many of you demanded justice? Have her killers been caught? You guys moved on as if it was a mosquito that was killed. 

Yet, you want to dance naked in the streets over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Justice for Israel, Free Israel. Which justice did you give Harira and her children? Watch the video of her husband crying like a baby. Because he is not Israeli, you don't care. He is just a Malam. Your sympathy and empathy are reserved for better people, not ordinary Aboki.

instagram,"Beyond the fame is a compelling story about a family's rise to success. Though they have numerous achievements, it does not dismiss them from both heartache and pain. The Jones' are what most people would consider the perfect family because of what they have accomplished. Together, they learned a lot about life itself and the hard work it takes to maintain a level of success.

Devin Jones is a businessman who is very successful by his own right. He is married to a beautiful woman by the name of Ashlee and they have 3 awesome children.

Devin stumbled upon distress, which caused conflict in his marriage, in addition to pain, and confusion among his children. Devin failed to consider the most important things in life as he betrays his wife and family. The perfect family doesn't seem so perfect, with infidelity, lost love, self-worth, and dignity. Family is important, and it is the foundation on which we build our lives upon.

Maybe Devin is human after all. Should a mistake shatter everything that he's worked so hard for? Devin must decide to swallow his pride and admit to his wrong doing.

Through growth, maturity, and self-awareness together the Jones family is able to overcome adversity.

instagram,"More thoughts below ‚¨áÔ∏è

It wasn‚Äôt uncommon for my husband or I on our wedding anniversary to ask the other, ‚ÄúIf you had it all to do over again, would you still marry me?‚Äù And we would say yes because we knew our spouse wanted to hear that. 

However, we were saying yes when it really mattered.

Sure, we wanted to. 

But what we weren‚Äôt being honest about we wanted more some days than to say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù was to:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Be right about what we thought we knew
2Ô∏è‚É£ Stay mad and wait for the other to apologize
3Ô∏è‚É£ Hold an offense and be bitter
4Ô∏è‚É£ Judge the choices you have made
5Ô∏è‚É£ Be too prideful to call the counselor or coach
6Ô∏è‚É£ Be mean to you because you have been mean to me

We sensed that we were saying ‚ÄúI do‚Äù to big things like sickness and poverty and when facing significant challenges. 

But we failed to realize that we were saying ‚ÄúI do‚Äù in the small day-to-day things; it grows us to say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù to the massive things.

Please note that on your wedding day, it takes two people saying ‚ÄúI do‚Äù to create a marriage, and that doesn‚Äôt change. 

It takes both spouses to say, ‚ÄúI do‚Äù each day.

The critical thing to remember is you are both human, so you will miss it. One of you will not choose to say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù on certain days of your marriage. And on another day, the other will choose not to. The beauty of marriage is it is a partnership, and saying ‚ÄúI do‚Äù means taking full responsibility for your stand in your commitment.

WARNING: I am not saying to stay in an abusive relationship. An abusive marriage is one or both spouses not choosing ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù Sometimes, genuinely walking out your commitment to love your spouse means letting the marriage die because you are no longer committed to the same thing.

instagram,"This is a developing story.

Saturday was a day of bloodshed unprecedented in Israel‚Äôs history. 

Beginning in the morning of a Jewish holiday, hundreds of attackers broke through the barrier between Israel and Gaza and spread into more than 20 locations, killing 600 Israelis on the streets, in their homes and at an outdoor festival, taking some 100 hostage and injuring more than 2,000. 

Nearly a day after they invaded, the fighters ‚Äî sent by the terror group Hamas ‚Äî appear to have been mostly but not entirely cleared out of Israeli territory. But the fighting is just beginning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising an unmitigated war on Gaza, which has seen repeated rounds of conflict with Israel over the past 15 years. 

The militants also took a large number of hostages back to Gaza, in addition to holding hostages in a kibbutz cafeteria and a private home in Israel. 

They captured two ambulances and an Israeli tank. They took control of the police station in the border city of Sderot for some 20 hours. They overran an Israeli military base.

A portion of the violence, and many of the graphic videos circulating on social media, came from an all-night party near the border, where revelers fled Hamas, but where some were taken captive into Gaza. 

Israeli-Palestinian violence has escalated all year, but the epicenter of that fighting has been in Jerusalem and the West Bank, not Gaza. A flareup of fighting between Hamas and Israel earlier this year ended after five days. 

Centrist Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel‚Äôs parliamentary opposition, has called for Netanyahu to form an emergency government that would include centrist parties as well as his current religious and far-right partners. Such an emergency government was also formed during the Six Day War in 1967. 

An emergency government including opposition parties would likely spell an end ‚Äî or at least a significant pause ‚Äî for the issue that until Saturday was causing widespread strife in Israel: the government‚Äôs judicial overhaul. A government with centrists would not approve such an overhaul, and it is less likely to move forward in the middle of a war.

üíûEven though the Venusian Eclipses are yet to happen , we are wading neck deep in their energies already. The discomfort is palpable,as though waiting for the other shoe to drop‚Ä¶.

‚öñÔ∏èIt's a Venus Home run all the way‚Ä¶the Ring of Fire eclipse on Oct 14th in venus ruled Libra and a Lunar eclipse in Venus ruled Taurus ie mega Endings and a Reset/ new trajectory  wrt Venusian themes ;- where are  our relationships with self and others/ partnerships/ collaborations / family/ community/ work/ career out of balance when it comes to being able to standing in our Truth wrt our Self worth, self acceptance and true heart desires / wants / needs. 

üëëIn addition as Venus is currently at Crown Chakra at the Gate of Authority in her Shamanic journey of Death and Rebirth as the Morning Star, these relationships are  being viewed through the lens of Power and  Authority -ie where are Power Games holding these relationships hostage , where is your authority being undermined. Where are we giving away our Power in relationships?

‚ù§Ô∏èEclipses are course correctors‚Ä¶.something's got to give!! Whether it's curtains for relationships feeling the heat or whether they can heal and move forward on new dynamics  of Balance depends on how the Lens of Power and Authority  is focused on the relationship.  Relationships need foundations of Love , mutual Respect , equal give and take ,conflict resolution and difficult conversations to survive and thrive- all of which are distorted if one or both parties are not Centered and grounded  in their Power/ Inner Strength . 

üíîIt is not about ‚ÄòPower Over‚Äô dynamics‚Ä¶No one is meant to exert Power Over another via toxic relationship dynamics of emotional blackmail, tantrums, withdrawal of Love etc. Love Sex and Desire- Central Venusian Themes , are Not meant to be Transactional .

üíûOur Partnerships / Relationships are  meant to be our Safe Space to Shine our Unique Eccentric and Eclectic Light without fear of Judgement or fear of being used as a weapon  against Us. And if they are not and you are constantly walking on eggshells ‚Ä¶it's because you have given your Power away in this relationship.

instagram,"Israel battered Gaza on Sunday, a day after suffering its bloodiest attack in decades when Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns, killing hundreds and abducting an unknown number of others, threatening a major new war in the Middle East.

In a sign the conflict could spread beyond Gaza, Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia exchanged artillery and rocket fire, while in Alexandria, two Israeli tourists were shot dead along with their Egyptian guide.

instagram,"Hope Family, this is a call to pray for the ongoing conflict in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.
 
Pray for peace and an end to the conflict. Pray for healing for those who are injured and grieving from this trauma.
 
Pray for believing brothers and sisters to look to God as their source of safety, security, and peace. Ask that their faith will shine brightly during this dark time.

Pray for wisdom and discernment for leaders (world governments, organizations, etc.) and parents as they make potential life and death decisions. 
 
Pray for the lost. Most of Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza are either Jewish or Muslim and have an incomplete view of God‚Äôs goodness and grace. Pray that they will come to know Jesus Christ as the Messiah.

instagram,"Het conflict tussen Isra√´l en Hamas is dit weekend volledig opgelaaid. In beide gebieden zijn de nodige burgerslachtoffers gevallen en zijn er grote zorgen over wat er de komende dagen nog te gebeuren staat. De joodse Max Nathans (86), die werd geboren in Arnhem en als kind ondergedoken zat in de Betuwe, is gevlucht naar het huis van zijn dochter.

Nathans (86) woont op 2,5 kilometer van de Libanese grens in Isra√´l. Sinds zaterdag blijven zijn familieleden en hij via de televisie op de hoogte van de ontwikkelingen. ""Het zijn vreselijke gebeurtenissen"", zegt hij. Nathans vreest dat de militante Libanese beweging Hezbollah zich ook in het conflict zal gaan mengen. Dat is zondagochtend ook gebeurd, schrijft NOS. Daarom is hij ge√´vacueerd en logeert hij bij zijn dochter, waar het veiliger is.

Nathans hoopt dat hij snel terug kan naar zijn huis. ""Mijn kleinkinderen zijn hier, maar mijn hond heb ik achter moeten laten. Ik hoop dat ik daar snel voor terug kan."" Niet iedereen in de streek waar de tachtiger woont heeft gekozen voor evacuatie. ""De meeste mensen zijn nu op veilige plekken, maar er is een aantal oudere mensen dat niet uit hun huis weg wilde"", aldus Nathans.

instagram,"Today, we find ourselves in a world where conflicts and tensions persist, and sadly, we've witnessed yet another tragic event unfold in the Middle East. The recent surprise attack by Hamas out of Gaza has stunned Israel and left hundreds dead in the ensuing fighting and retaliation. Our hearts go out to the families who have lost their loved ones in this devastating conflict, and we offer our deepest condolences during these trying times.

It is crucial, in moments like these, to remember the profound human cost of such conflicts. Each life lost represents a story, a family, and a community forever changed. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, who never asked for this violence.

It is also essential to reaffirm our commitment to peace and stability in the region. We stand with Israel, not just as a nation, but as a beacon of hope and resilience. Israel has faced numerous challenges throughout its history, and yet it continues to seek a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict.

As we reflect on the events that have unfolded, let us remember the value of dialogue, diplomacy, and empathy in resolving disputes. Peace is not an easy path, but it is the one that offers the best hope for a brighter future for all the people of the region.

Together, we can strive for a world where such devastating conflicts become a thing of the past.

The brutal and relentless terrorist attacks orchestrated by Hamas have triggered a renewed cycle of violence, which must be unequivocally condemned. It is imperative to express our strongest condemnation against such acts.

In order to bring an end to the suffering, it is essential that the international community does everything in its power for a two-state solution, where two democratic states peacefully coexist side by side in a secure and harmonious manner. This approach is widely regarded as the most viable path towards resolving the conflict, ending the occupation and ensuring lasting peace.

Ultimately, the goal should be to address the immense suffering experienced by all people affected by the conflict and work towards establishing a future characterized by peace, security, and prosperity for both Israel and Palestine.",,412,"{'like_count': 398, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 7386}",Evin Incir,,2023-10-08 10:35:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/386638643_351511917344127_9011604212036412692_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=OfSMr89N2t4AX9REEev&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD2zVuFU4Kv2OXZe_Zo9Ghv6sRUSQL0A3nMD8DGgUxuFg&oe=655A1C92,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyInsmAs8TB/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386887368_903384714462996_4448295229932496478_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=v8oak4OW7zkAX87rmQG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBgYY9W0lE2ZsqnTdIwGJdYy7b0Pv_bSYKrn33xDVu0UA&oe=65592B54

instagram,"Fighting between Israeli forces and the Palestinian militant group Hamas raged Sunday, with hundreds killed on both sides after a surprise attack on Israel prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn they were ""embarking on a long and difficult war"".

The conflict's bloodiest escalation in decades saw Hamas carry out a massive rocket barrage and ground, air and sea offensive early Saturday that Israel's army said had killed more than 200 Israelis and wounded 1,000.

Gaza officials said intense Israeli air strikes on the coastal enclave had brought the Palestinian death toll to at least 232, with nearly 1,700 wounded.

Gun battles raged into Sunday morning between Israeli forces and hundreds of Hamas fighters in at least 22 Israel locations, including at least two where gunmen were holding hostages, the army said. 

It later added that it had fired artillery on southern Lebanon in response to a shot from the area, without providing further details. 

""We are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack,"" Netanyahu said on X, formerly Twitter, early Sunday.

""The first stage is ending at this time by the destruction of the vast majority of the enemy forces that infiltrated our territory.

instagram,"To all my concerned friends who are asking if I'm safe and okay, I need you to know I'm safe, but I am far from okay. The situation here is terrible. I'm using the term 'here' because every word, name or term that divides our territories only adds fuel to this crisis.

I can't escape the heartbreaking videos‚ÄîIsraeli citizens, including the elderly and children, being kidnapped and murdered, and Gaza's citizens, also children, are being killed, illegally arrested or living in fear of relentless bombings. And then there are those voices of these influencers from both sides, trying to explain who's right and who's wrong. It's amazing, they all use the exact same rhetoric and mimics, and I'm left wondering: What's the point?

It's time for these influential figures to take a stand and rally their followers for one crucial cause: ending the conflict. We need to unite in demanding an end to this vicious circle, end this madness, the violence, and the terror.

I've been protesting against the occupation for years, but when I see Palestinian pages posting about an 86-year-old Israeli woman being kidnapped, followed by chants of 'Free Palestine,' it's heartbreaking. My hope for humanity dies.

instagram,"üí¨ Leviathan: Symbolises a strong, overarching government that upholds law & order, protects lives & property. Hobbes believed a Leviathan was needed to prevent the inevitable conflicts & violence that would result from absence of a strong governing authority.

Leviathan presents a comprehensive account of human nature, politics, & society with a¬†goal¬†to investigate the foundations of political authority & to demonstrate the need for a strong, centralised state. Introduces concept of social contract, where individuals surrender¬†some of their natural rights in exchange for security & protection from a sovereign authority. Key text in history of political thought bcs it establishes the foundation for modern political philosophy & concerns on role of the state.

Note that it¬†was first published in 1651 during English Civil War, a time of England's¬†great political & social upheaval‚Äîgov structure & monarchy-Parliament relations were greatly affected by the war. It has had an impact on the evolution of modern political thought, as well as the concepts of sovereignty, the social contract, & individual rights. Hobbes' ideas about the need for a strong central authority to maintain order & security are still debated in today's discussions about governance & the balance of state power & individual liberties. The exploration of human nature & potential for conflict discussed signifies understanding international relations & conflicts dynamics.

Reading this reminds me of Das Capital as social ownership & property is a complex issue influenced by many philosophical traditions. Hobbes envisions a strong, centralised state that maintains order & security, while Marxism envisions a classless society from capitalism. Leviathan aims to¬†prevents chaos & violence, whilst¬†Marxism views the state as a tool of class oppression that protects the ruling class & enforces private property rights. Both theories emphasise the need for a strong state to prevent conflict & maintain stability, but Marxism envisions a society without a controlling¬†state.

Overall, recommended for those who‚Äôd like to understand political philosophy & governance.

instagram,"""The Tale of Zatoichi"" is a classic that started a series of films that lasted from 1962 to 1973; 25 films in total. Then in 1974, a television series was created about Zatoichi which starred the same lead actor, Shintaro Katsu, and it lasted for 100 episodes. There was one final film of Zatoichi in 1989 that was written and directed by Katsu. There was even an American remake of ""Zatoichi Challenged"" (the 17th film of the Zatoichi series) and it was titled ""Blind Fury"" (it starred the late Rutger Hauer). There have been several reimaginings of Zatoichi (including one directed by and starring Takeshi Kitano) and there will probably be more in the future.
Enough talk about the history lesson, let's talk about the first film in this long running series.

""The Tale of Zatoichi"" is about a blind swordsman named Ichi who is hired by an yakuza gang since they believe a war is inevitable with the rival gang. Ichi becomes close friends with a fellow talented swordsman, Hirate. Unfortunately, Ichi and Hirate know they will most likely have to duel each other since Hirate is hired by the rival gang.

What makes this film so great is that it focuses on character drama and conflict for majority of its runtime. You get to know these characters rather well and it makes the one big action scene at the end have so much more of an impact on the viewer. The cinematography of this film is drop dead gorgeous. Cinematographer Chishi Makiura knows how to use deep focus and low key lighting for some harsh shadows in order to capture the tension of the personal conflicts of these characters. Shintaro Katsu brings such charisma and likability to the tragic character of Ichi that you will understand why Japanese audiences were obsessed with this character for decades.

I highly recommend watching this film. The only complaint I have with it is that the first 20 minutes are rather slow.

instagram,"Time for a High Level Observation. Yesterdays event was unprecedented in its scope but not in its trajectory. Yesterday marked the 50 year anniversary of the ‚ÄúYom Kippur War‚Äù which happened on 10/6/73 and was a sneak attack from the Egyptians on the Israelis, which was an echo of a conflict that can be traced to Biblical times. Yesterday also was the 22nd anniversary of the US invasion of Afghanistan, the US‚Äô longest war which ended in humiliation last year with Biden‚Äôs abrupt withdrawal. Ironically, the 22 year anniv also aligns with a tragic 6.3 earthquake that also took place yesterday in Afghanistan that happened at 11:11 AM. 11+11=22. 
The catalyst for this conflict can be traced to an incident last week, where an Israeli settler attempted to sacrifice a goat at the heavily contested Temple of the Mount. The ritual sacrifice can be traced back to the animal sacrifice of Passover, which protected ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù families from the plague placed on Egypt that took their first born‚Ä¶sons to free them up from ‚ÄúPharaoh.‚Äù Ironically for the first time, settlers in the West Bank saw their homes invaded by Hamas militants and entire families being slaughtered home to home. That goat/lamb/sheep blood could‚Äôve came into good use yesterday. Now there will be rivers of blood, paid as retribution for lost ‚ÄúIsraeli‚Äù life in disputed ancestral land that belongs to neither occupants but some accounts. We gon have to call in a collective QUANTUM meditation for this one, this has every indication of getting way out of control. There are sooooooo many factors at play right now that threaten to pull multiple parties into this conflict and escalate it into the next World War.

instagram,"Those who have ambitions of glory, who can and will make history, know that history is a game. For the others, who are their pawns, history is a succession of catastrophes: history is the controversy for which they are the gags, the dispute for which they are the plugs, the war for which they are the corpses, the embrace for which they are the prohibition. The players that recognize this extreme game that goes beyond their life know that they must actually go beyond themselves; and this may not be enough. Far from discouraging them, this immeasurable necessity attracts them. I will not enumerate the qualities that are necessary in order to win, because everything is useful. I only want to show that the aim is the victory, that history is short!

The enemies of history affirm: that history is long; and also: that history is determined. Thus, this absolute game is the game for the (pre)dominance of the totality, which belongs to all humanity, but also the conflict of divided humanity. In fact, what makes this game absolute is that it has no rules other than those established by the participants and so always completely ephemeral. The sacred is a rule of the profane game; the infinite is the labyrinth of illusion in history. The absolute is itself only a rule implied in establishing explicit rules.

Finally, history is to life what the daily reality is to survival, the measure of its time. The game is the general activity of the human being, where intelligence is the unity of heart and mind. In his need to practice the game, history, the human being encounters necessity as misery, as accident, as the alienation of his intelligence. Our epoch completes the world showing work opposed to the game, necessity opposed to life, daily reality opposed to richness.

 You are called to be the architect of change to be the visionary and healer who holds the intention so strongly in your heart for an era of global peace to be anchored and who actively embodies the values, integrity & authenticity needed to be a change maker, timeline shifter and coinsx creator within this current reality experience. 

We are called to unite in prayer and to set the intention within our hearts for unity, hope, love, compassion and truth to be the cornerstones of a new age where global peace is the reality and expectation for all of our global our soul family.

The old matrices are breaking down as centuries of separation programming is resurfacing bringing to the forefront old karmic conflict wounds held within the land/grids and within our own collective memory.

Your heart felt intention for peace and your capacity to hold love as a vibration forms a ray of hope igniting a flame within the hearts of each and every one of us which radiates out into the quantum field infusing the grids with love and raising the planetary heart field & collective heart field.

The statement called for ""a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the establishment of two states,"" allowing the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and establish an ""independent, sovereign state within the pre-1967 borders, with the Eastern part of #alQuds as its capital.""

Now running his own successful training company Pangolin Group, Mike is sponsoring ( and running !) the Royal Park Half Marathon today in support of the Rory Peck Trust @rorypecktrust It exists to protect freelance journalists globally, providing safety training, professional and psychological support and assistance with equipment, therapy and crisis funds. Never is an organisation more needed for freelance journalists and I am super proud of my husband in both his role - that both saves lives, and offers crucial support.

instagram,"Pray for IsraelüáÆüá±

We are at a loss for words over the attacks in Israel today. Our hearts break for the nation of Israel, and we grieve the loss of innocent lives caught in the middle of the conflict. It is at times like this‚Äì‚Äìwhen our spirit is downcast, when we lack the words to speak, and when we don't know what the future holds‚Äì‚Äìthat we know prayer must be our first response.¬†

Would you join us as a church in praying for the people and families who have been affected by this attack?¬† Would you pray for wisdom¬†for the leaders and authorities making decisions at this crucial time? Would you pray that God would bring peace and hope to all those who are weary and brokenhearted?

As a church, we stop, together, in this moment. We stop to feel the full weight of this situation, because we know it also lies heavy on the heart of God. We stop to be still and know that He is God‚Äì‚Äìall powerful, almighty, and always in control‚Äì‚Äìeven in times like these.

God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Come and see what the Lord has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth. He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields[d] with fire. He says, ‚ÄúBe still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.‚Äù The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

instagram,"Rational choice theory is a foundational framework in the field of international relations that seeks to explain the decision-making processes of states and actors in the international system. This theory assumes that these actors are rational, self-interested, and driven by a desire to maximize their utility or well-being. In essence, they carefully weigh the costs and benefits of different courses of action and select the one that promises the highest net gain. This perspective has broad applications in international relations, including alliance formation, nuclear weapons acquisition, trade policy, and conflict resolution.
While rational choice theory provides valuable insights into state behavior, it has faced criticism for oversimplifying human decision-making by overlooking emotional and cultural factors. Nonetheless, it remains a useful tool for understanding the pursuit of national interests and strategic decision-making in international politics. It's important to note that in practice, real-world decision-making is often influenced by a mix of rational calculations, external constraints, and non-rational elements, making international relations a complex and multifaceted field of study.
Rational choice theory is applied to explain how states and actors make decisions based on self-interest and utility maximization. Examples include alliance formation for security, nuclear proliferation for deterrence, trade policy for economic benefits, and crisis decision-making. It also helps analyze choices related to international organizations, economic sanctions, conflict resolution, and international treaties. While the theory emphasizes rational calculations, it acknowledges that decision-making can be influenced by various factors, including non-rational elements and external constraints. #rationalchoice #internationalrelations #internationalrelationstheory #rational #tradepolicy #talkdiplomacy #upsc #css #upscmotivation #csstricks #upscaspirants #decisionmaking #multifacated #internationalpolitics #geopolitics #nuclearproliferation #internationalrelationsstudent #economicbenefits #decisionmaking #constraints #economicsanctions #unitednations #warandpeace",,312,"{'like_count': 308, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 91579}",TalkDiplomacy IR,,2023-10-08 13:58:17,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/328799506_219447953811073_3104956161528819700_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pw2J3khjfvsAX8PWC77&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDB5PH0Ztb9ehsOpSDE9OQh8wdqO0qrpdwjjvpSRE76eQ&oe=655AEA98,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI-2UZLys-/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387267279_2597353157078503_1289630106232117871_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=V_4RumhWHI0AX8M_3U0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBWi59OqlDpVihu_WY9LBWi3zIYUFvD-tDHgbUMXiE-XA&oe=653024B4

It's about HOME & COMMUNITY taken from FAMILIES.

LIFE is a treasure beyond measure.

In the face of adversity, in distant lands where hearts are heavy with the weight of conflict and fear, we are compelled to pause and count our blessings.

We are reminded that amidst the chaos of the world, our most cherished possession is not material wealth, nor fleeting success.

It is something far more profound, far more enduring‚Äîour families and the safe homes and havens we live in.

Our families, the tapestries of love and connection that have been woven over generations, are the steadfast pillars that support us through the storms of life. 

They are the wellspring of our joy, the haven of our solace, and the beacon of our hope. It is in the warm embrace of loved ones, in the laughter that echoes through our homes, and in the moments of shared meals and stories that we find the true essence of Thanksgiving.

On this day, our thoughts extend beyond our own borders and hearts reach across oceans. We offer our deepest prayers of light, love, and strength to Israel and to all those who endure the hardships of war, chaos, conflict, and fear, we stand with you.

To all in our BUZZ Community, we pray with and for you and your families here in Canada and overseas in Israel.

To the villains who destroy homes and safe havens, hurt women and children due to personal, political and religious ideologies - may you one day realize you stood on the wrong side.

War is never the answer.

Peace is - choose the path of goodness.

Praying strong for Shani Louk. ü§ç

instagram,"New Delhi: On Friday, October 6, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justices Vikram Nath and Rajesh Bindal, in Joginder Pal vs The State of Himachal Pradesh,  stayed the Himachal Pradesh high court‚Äôs order dated April 26, 2023, setting aside the findings of the court below that the accused be treated as major and be tried accordingly. The high court had also ordered an ossification test of the accused to be conducted by the Juvenile Justice Board, and depending upon the report of the Testing Authority, dealing with the accused in accordance with law.

In the instant case, the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) held the murder-accused in a road rage case to be a juvenile on September 19, 2014, finding his age below 18 years of age on the date of the incident, June 20, 2014. The father of the deceased challenged the JJB‚Äôs order before the Court of Sessions Judge, Mandi (Himachal Pradesh) which allowed the appeal, setting aside JJB‚Äôs order with a direction to make an inquiry for determination of the age of the accused and thereafter to proceed with the matter in accordance with the law.

Thereafter, another order was passed by the JJB on May 26, 2017, again finding the age of the accused to be below 18 years, and he was declared as juvenile in conflict with law. The father of the deceased again assailed the order by way of an appeal, and in terms of judgment dated February 28, 2018, the appellate court set aside the JJB‚Äôs order, and issued directions to make a fresh inquiry for determination of the age of the accused and to proceed with the matter thereafter.

The accused, Shiv Kumar alias Shivam, filed a criminal revision petition before the high court, alleging that he was not heard by the appellate court before passing the order on February 28, 2018. The high court set aside the order of the appellate court, directing it to hear the matter afresh after hearing the accused. Upon remand, the appellate court again set aside the JJB‚Äôs order dated May 26, 2017, and directed the Board to make an inquiry for determination of the age of the accused.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his country would launch a prolonged military campaign against the militant group and expressed confidence Israel would win. President Joe Biden pledged ‚Äúrock solid‚Äù US support for Israel.

The conflict comes at a time of diplomatic sensitivity and also a moment of historic division within Israel over Netanyahu‚Äôs coalition with Israel‚Äôs far-right and their efforts to overhaul the nation‚Äôs judiciary. The Israeli shekel has slumped toward a seven-year low in recent days, ahead of the scheduled reopening of Israel‚Äôs parliament later this month.

Many anticipate a significant shift into uncharted territory this October.

Our world civilization has already experienced unprecedented chaos and conflict.

The BEAST System‚Äôs involvement in a major event in Israel signals intense and ominous End Times developments.

Israelis are known for their dramatic flair, and their capacity to orchestrate events, such as 9/11, draws the entire world into their grand spectacle.

Their long history with Hollywood has honed their showmanship and audience manipulation skills to perfection.

Considering the significant presence of MOSSAD operatives in Palestine, it‚Äôs apparent how Israel could swiftly execute a classic false flag invasion.

Do you really believe Hamas invaded by land sea and air? 

Who do you think created Hamas? 

How were they able to send a barrage of a missiles and by passing the iron dome?

instagram,"GAZA CITY, Palestine (AFP) - Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a large-scale surprise attack against Israel Saturday, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza and sending ground units to kill or abduct people as Israel retaliated with air strikes.

At least 40 people were reported killed in Israel, while Gaza authorities reported a death toll of 198 in the bloodiest escalation in the Israel-Palestinian conflict since May 2021. ""We are at war,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the military launched a series of strikes against targets of Iran-backed Hamas in the blockaded coastal enclave.

""The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,"" the right-wing veteran premier vowed after Hamas launched its first such combined air, ground and sea offensive, on a Jewish holiday and half a century after the outbreak of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.

Its impossible that they were caught by surprise & very plausible they orchestrated the whole thing ( ya know, like the whole 20yrs of ‚Äúisis‚Äù wars) 
The ferocity of the forthcoming israeli counteroffensive will shock the world.
It will likely threaten the very existence of a Palestinian state & will no doubt draw Iran into the conflict.
H–îM–î$ are supported by Iran who just received $6billion from Biden.

üìñDelta by Sybil Bartel 

In this standalone addition to The Alpha Elite Series, we meet Delta, a Navy SEAL turned private security expert. Known for his foresight and precision, Delta navigates the world with an unmatched ability to predict and strategize. However, when faced with an unpredictable blonde, he finds himself in uncharted territory. The story unfolds amidst dire circumstances and intricate moral webs, emphasizing themes of honor, guilt, and resilience.
Delta's character is meticulously crafted, revealing layers of complexity and internal conflict. The symbolism of the SEAL and the man, intertwined with themes of protection, free will, and the impact of power, adds depth to the narrative. The pace is unrelenting, mirroring the urgency and tension of the unfolding events. Bartel skillfully weaves a narrative of brotherhood in arms, camaraderie, and the resilience born of shared experiences.
Both Delta and the woman he saved and fights for deserve a happily ever after. There‚Äôs so much going on between them . Always having options and given the upper hand, she may be younger but she does know what she wants and that‚Äôs breaking all the walls that he put up and keep her safe space in his heart. Which she does with no issues from him. 
‚ÄúDelta"" is a compelling read that delves into the complexities of duty, love, steamy romance and the unwavering pursuit of victory through loyalty and courage. The author‚Äôs masterful storytelling ensures a captivating journey for these characters that I have been loving for quite a few years now.

@soundgarden - Badmotorfinger (1991)

Kim Thayil compared listening to the album to ""reading a novel [about] man's conflict with himself and society, or the government, or his family, or the economy, or anything.""

Chris Cornell said ""Outshined"" is about going from ""periods of extreme self-confidence"" to ""plummeting in the opposite direction"".

Trivia you can probably google:

- Rusty Cage, Searching with My Good Eye Closed, & Holy Water hace the six string tuned down to B. Mind Riot has all strings tuned to different octaves of E.
-Outshined time signature is partially 7/4 while Face Pollution is 9/8.
-Badmotorfinger was scheduled for release on September 24, 1991, but A&M Records pushed it back to October 8 due to ""production problems.""
-The album included the singles ""Jesus Christ Pose"", ""Outshined"", and ""Rusty Cage"", which gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations. The music videos for ""Outshined"" and ""Rusty Cage"" gained considerable airtime on MTV, but the video for ""Jesus Christ Pose"", the album's lead single, was removed from MTV's playlist amidst widespread controversy over the perceived anti-Christian message of the song and video. Hail Satan!

Again! Israel‚Äôs conflict with the Palestinians and Gaza and the west bank is not new. Terrorist did infiltrate homes before. But it was one or two terrorists who got into Israel and entered a home, a mall, a bus stop, and killed innocent civilians.
Rockets hit Israel many times before. BUT THIS is an attack on a whole other level. Number one thing that happened is there was a cyber attack on all communications, top Israeli units egos jobs are to secure the borders, did not see anything. They got caught by surprise, the were murdered in cold blood. While this is happening on all the fronts of the borders, thousands of rockets are hitting Israeli cities, while this commotion is taking place hundreds of terrorists infiltrated the cities of civilians Israelis killing anything that moved. Raped and mutilated bodies, separated children from mothers, killed entire families, then went to a rave party in the desert, where hundreds of young women and men where parting, they took over 200 hostages, some were raped while being filmed, some killed, and some were taken into Gaza. As we speak there are 800 dead people. 3000 badly wounded, 250 soldiers dead, and 180 missing- who are inside Gaza.  Hamas men dressed the young Israeli women with hijab and recorded a video ‚Äú showing them, saying ‚Äú you will bare our children ‚Äú if you support Hamas in anyway, and you think you show support to Palestinians, or to any ‚Äú human rights ‚Äú group, you are badly misinformed, mistaken, and delusional, they the most evil, misogyny, barbarian terrorist who hijacked their own people. 2 billion  Muslims in the world are NOT terrorists,  the moderate good Muslims are helpless when it comes  to hezbolla and Hamas, Iranian women, non Jews, who decide to show their hair are brutally murdered.",,205,"{'like_count': 185, 'comment_count': 20, 'num_users': 46750}",Sigal Erez,,2023-10-08 03:43:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/122501774_799382234195812_8738240285005231668_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=zJ5KRXko-ccAX8wQL6H&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA6Oe2qxkzh0sgJs-UOfgNbWQmoXVlqLDqKGTk2bWdcoA&oe=655A680E,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyH4gK0r05L/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387675318_250714764196119_655056777757874966_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=7IWB6jFwbmgAX_V0gRj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCgCUaL3M6es0Esd90g3ObQ8My_65m1J72eNMUqfp0Jeg&oe=6558F5BB

instagram,"‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: shocking images

With a heavy heart, we share concerning news about a tragic incident - another deliberate tiger killing, this time by poisoning. 

As their forest habitat vanishes, tigers desperately fight for survival. Their natural prey becomes scarcer, forcing tigers to venture into farmlands for food. This leads to conflicts with farmers who rely on their livestock for income and sustenance.

We're building tiger-proof livestock pens (cattle corrals) to empower farmers to protect their cattle without resorting to extreme measures. This approach promotes peaceful coexistence between tigers and humans.

üî¥ Urgent Goal: We need to raise $12,000 by the fast-approaching deadline of 13 October to make this vital project a reality.

Your kindness can save lives and protect both tigers and communities. Join us in this crucial mission to end human-tiger conflict and ensure tigers continue to roam Sumatra's rainforests.

üôè Donate today and help us reach our goal at the link in our bio.

MEDIA STATEMENT ON RECENT EVENTS IN GAZA
8 OCTOBER 2023

1. Recent Events in Gaza: As the Chairman of Serantau Muslim, I wholeheartedly support the ""Taufan Al-Aqsa"" operation initiated by the Hamas government in Gaza. It has come to our attention that Netanyahu has referred to this as a 'war'. We would like to emphasize that, since their occupation of Palestine in 1948, Israel‚Äôs actions can be seen as an ongoing conflict and war with the Muslim Ummah.

2.	Pride in Unity: We take pride in the naming of this conflict as ""Taufan Al-Aqsa"". This name not only signifies a response to the decades-long oppression of the Palestinian people from a humanitarian standpoint but also from a spiritual and theological perspective. Al-Aqsa holds immense significance as the first Qibla for Muslims, and its importance cannot be overstated.

3.	A Call to Arab Nations: This should serve as a wake-up call for Arab countries to reconsider and cease any normalization or cooperation efforts with Israel. The sanctity of our religious sites and the rights of our Palestinian brothers and sisters must always take precedence over political or economic interests.

4.	A Global Call to Action: I also urge our fellow Muslim-majority nations such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey , Nigeria and other non-Arab countries to rise awareness and understanding of the Al-Aqsa issue. Our collective voice can be a potent force. We have witnessed in the past how Israel was pertubed by Malaysia's social media movement with the hashtag #IsraelKoyak. We can once again demonstrate our unwavering support.

5.	Not Terrorism, but Liberation: Lastly, let the narrative be clear. This is not an act of terrorism; it is a struggle for the liberation of our homeland and what was once the Qibla of the Muslim community. We must unite behind this cause and ensure that our voices, both individually and collectively, resonete worldwide.

It‚Äôs crucial to take this as a wakeup call ‚Äì a reminder of the unpredictable nature of the world. If you haven‚Äôt already, I strongly encourage you to seek out the raw footage on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Witnessing the reality of such events can be a powerful motivator to prioritize preparedness. While it might seem extreme to some, being prepared for any eventuality is a wise choice in these uncertain times. Don‚Äôt let anyone deter you from taking precautions, because as recent events have shown, it‚Äôs better to be prepared than caught off guard. This is a stark reminder that being ready is not crazy; it‚Äôs prudent. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and stay prepared. #whyweprep #justkeepprepping

[Following the outbreak] of conflict in the Gaza Strip (with large scale simultaneous attacks by insurgent forces into Israeli towns and cities) ‚Äì least one Israeli 'Merkava' Mk IV (MBT) main battle tank, armed with a (120mm IMI MG251-LR) main cannon, and a 'Namer' (APC) armoured personnel carrier were captured by militias from the Gaza Strip. 

__
[The conflict] between the Palestinian insurgent groups and the Israeli Defense Forces, in its first few hours saw the launch of around 3,000 rockets that were fired from the Gaza Strip ‚Äì numerous heavily armed militant groups broke through the border of the Gaza Strip into Israel ‚Äì the opening hours of the war have resulted in the deaths of at least 600 Israelis and over 230 Palestinians, with over a thousand people wounded on both sides.

__
The Palestinian insurgents took numerous Israelis as prisoners - it occurred on the anniversary of the Yom Kipper War of October 1973, when the Israeli Defense Forces fought armoured, aerial and naval engagements against the Egyptians and Syrian Armed Forces from October 6th - 25th, 1973.

instagram,"Met police have said: In light of the ongoing conflict in Israel and the border with Gaza, Londoners will see more police officers on the streets across the Capital to reassure and protect communities.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine, in charge of policing London today, said: ‚ÄúWe are aware that this conflict has a far reaching impact on communities around the world, and we extend our full support to those affected in London.

‚ÄúWe are listening and working with communities and partners to ensure people feel safe and protected. We ask that members of the public report anything concerning, such as threatening behaviour.

‚ÄúWe are aware that a number of demonstrations and protests are planned. We have spoken to the organisers and we expect these will pass off peacefully. However, we will take a zero tolerance approach to any activity which crosses the lines into criminality.‚Äù

In the last 24 hours, a small number of low level public order incidents in different parts of London have been reported and highlighted on social media. Police attended all of the incidents and were able to resolve them without arrests being made.

There are a number of protests being planned, including a Stop The War protest due to be held tomorrow, Monday, 9 October, in central London. We are in liaison with the organisers of these protests and an appropriate policing plan is in place that balances the right to lawful protest against any disruption to Londoners.

While officers will be there primarily to ensure protests pass off peacefully, we will make arrests if it is suspected that a criminal offence has been committed.

As part of our increased policing patrols across key areas of London, we have been in touch with synagogues, mosques, and businesses to discuss their concerns and provide them with safety advice.",,156,"{'like_count': 100, 'comment_count': 56, 'num_users': 126566}",London & uk Street News,,2023-10-08 16:58:50,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/372969362_152673827882252_2740585276065386044_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SjO3N-N1ppkAX9wnQcQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA8qXtHVmPobt_6vkhIshh55tJKKw0FM-Bl0z0ERwn_ow&oe=655B45BA,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyJTgveIgk2/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387265428_1729348004172551_1367894563753576984_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=S-E8LNM79GAAX-7mrvq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA9dlizJjFuaa1vd2ROaLKcugbrY7tegXa2uXTj5ZHrNw&oe=652DF68A

Many anticipate a significant shift into uncharted territory this October.

Our world civilization has already experienced unprecedented chaos and conflict.

The BEAST System‚Äôs involvement in a major event in Israel signals intense and ominous End Times developments.

Israelis are known for their dramatic flair, and their capacity to orchestrate events, such as 9/11, draws the entire world into their grand spectacle.

Their long history with Hollywood has honed their showmanship and audience manipulation skills to perfection.

Considering the significant presence of MOSSAD operatives in Palestine, it‚Äôs apparent how Israel could swiftly execute a classic false flag invasion.

Do you really believe Hamas invaded by land sea and air? 

Who do you think created Hamas? 

How were they able to send a barrage of a missiles and by passing the iron dome?

instagram,"And it‚Äôs the innocent civilians who suffer and perish the most in times of conflict.

I am seeing many posts proclaiming to ‚Äòstand with Israel‚Äô or ‚Äòstand with Palestine‚Äô and a barrage of comments supporting or attacking each other after yesterday‚Äôs act of terror.

The nuances are deep and anybody trying to navigate this topic will ultimately piss off somebody. 

But no I can‚Äôt blindly say I stand with Palestine‚Ä¶thus encouraging a horrific attack on unarmed citizens while they attend a music festival or celebrating a religious holiday (I use the generic term instead of specifying Simchat Torah because one must picture this at any celebration of Islam, Christianity, Hinduism etc)

And no I don‚Äôt blindly say I stand with Israel as they‚Äôve forcibly removed Palestinians from their land for decades.  Ramping up controversial developments on Palestinian land as they choke Gaza and West Bank of basic human rights.

One cannot expect a people to idly sit and watch their land and culture be eliminated without recourse.

But the way Hamas has been parading Israeli hostages around and their indiscriminate killings cannot be the answer.

I stand with human decency, for peace.  I stand for what is right and most polarized comments are ignorant or forgetting this (on both sides).

I am neither Israeli, Jewish, Palestinian nor Muslim so of course my view is hollow and meaningless.  I speak only as a traveler who has received kindness from both Israelis and Palestinians, there, in Canada and around the world.

I just know the suffering is only beginning for both sides, and I pray for a de-escalation before it erupts into a wider conflict.

Thankful for peace and love in my life, Happy Thanksgiving üôèüèº

Cue the pissed off comments now üé¨

We‚Äôre seeing the western political/media class bleating the word ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù in unison again, this time in reference to the massive multi-pronged operation launched by Hamas against Israel on Saturday morning which reportedly killed hundreds of Israelis.

‚ÄúThe United States unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians,‚Äù reads a statement from the White House.

‚ÄúThe loss of life in Israel as a result of the violent, calculated and unprovoked attack by Hamas is heartbreaking,‚Äù reads a statement by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

‚ÄúThe unprovoked terror attack today and the murders of innocent Israeli citizens are a stark reminder of the brutality of Hamas and Iran-backed extremists,‚Äù reads a statement by congressman and house speaker contender Jim Jordan.

‚ÄúThis ignominious, unprovoked, and barbaric attack on Israel must be met with world condemnation and unequivocal support for the Jewish state‚Äôs right to self-defense,‚Äù tweeted presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.

‚ÄúThis is an ‚Äòunprovoked attack on civilians‚Äô: Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg,‚Äù reads a recent Fox News report.

‚ÄúUnprovoked aggression by Hamas terrorists,‚Äù reads a tweet by former secretary of state Mike Pompeo.

‚ÄúI forcefully condemn these cowardly, horrifying, unprovoked attacks on Israel by Hamas,‚Äù tweeted congressman John Fetterman.

‚ÄúThese attacks by Hamas against Israel were heinous and unprovoked,‚Äù tweeted Senator Mark Kelly.

‚ÄúAs a steadfast supporter and ally of Israel, I unequivocally condemn the unprovoked and unprecedented terrorist attack launched by Hamas and stand with the people of Israel as it rightly defends itself,‚Äù tweeted congressman Richie Torres.

‚ÄúThe unprovoked attacks on Israel by Hamas through Gaza and via air and sea, are absolutely a terrorist attack,‚Äù tweeted Democratic Party pundit Ed Krassenstein.

‚ÄúI unequivocally condemn Hamas‚Äô horrific, unprovoked attacks and call on all parties to take steps to prevent civilian harm,‚Äù tweeted congresswoman Sara Jacobs.
