facebook,"FOLLOW US : United Panther Party - U.S. FOR THE LATEST UPDATES AND RARE INSIGHTS 2Pac explains why institutional and systemic bias, as well as resource-theft, leads to conflict; which is why the modern-created State of Israel is reaping what they sow. ZIONISM: A WHITE SETTLER-COLONIAL CULT SCAM OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE Invention of the Mizrahim Israel invented the word Mizrahim to strip Arab Jews of their histories, as they tried to do with Palestinians. The State of Israel was conceived at the turn of the 20th century in Eastern Europe by a group of elite secular non-religious European Jews who launched a movement called Zionism that sought to establish a physical nation state exclusive to Jews. It was a typical White settler-colonial cult enterprise, complete with the narrative of a divine mandate, a ""Manifest Destiny"" (sound familiar?) and a non-existent or savage indigenous population, central to which was the myth that Jews of the world formed a singular people, favored by God, who were returning to their singular place of origin ‚Äì Palestine ‚Äì after a three thousand year absence. Although it was a project conceived in Europe by Europeans and for European Jews, they lacked sufficient numbers to build a population large enough to conquer the indigenous Palestinian population. Thus, recruitment of Jews from the surrounding Arab world was a necessary inconvenience. They did so through propaganda and by creating false flag terror incidents (bombing of synagogues or Jewish centers) in order to provoke an exodus of Arab Jews. A prime example of this happened in Iraq, where the oldest Jewish community in the world had lived for millennia as contributing members of Iraqi society, and who prospered, contributed to the arts and the economy, and participated in government. But these Jews were not embraced as brethren by European Zionists. Zionism was decidedly colonial, and that meant that Jews of the Arab world were seen as incomplete, barbaric, dirty, uncivilized. Za‚Äôev Jabotinsky, one of the forefathers of Zionism, said, ‚ÄúWe Jews have nothing in common with what is called the Orient, thank God. To the extent that our uneducated masses [Arab Jews] have ancient spiritual traditions and laws that call the Orient, they must be weaned away from them, and this is in fact what we are doing in every decent school, what life itself is doing with great success. We are going in Palestine, first for our national convenience, [second] to sweep out thoroughly all traces of the Oriental soul.‚Äù ALSO READ: Ashkenazi Jews, with a population of over 10 million worldwide, descend from ONLY 350 ethnic Jews from just 600‚Äì1000 years ago, study finds. They are NOT genetic descendants of the ancient Hebrew Israelites of over 3,000 years ago. https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPantherParty/posts/pfbid026QzoNQCV9S53di5X1BQEX4mDYwywuCsCRK9FQCXZPhGVytTEtj5jWjwipgBkprUkl A multitude of programs and protocols were implemented towards this goal. One of the most egregious was a large initiative of stealing the babies of Arab Jews and giving them to be raised by European Jews. But the larger efforts were simple propaganda campaigns that were implemented in schools, communities, and national projects. In essence, it was a project to strip ancient peoples of their identities, which was not unlike what they tried to do to Palestinians. Zionists were trying to create a new nation with a unified people. So, they could not abide allowing parts of this population to continue to identify as Iraqi, Moroccan, Persian, Tunisian, and so on, and certainly not as Arab Jews. At the same time, the racist impulses of colonialism could not abide putting these people on par with Jews of Europe. They could not simply be Jews in the new Jewish state. Thus, the word Mizrahim, from the Hebrew and Arabic words meaning ‚Äúthose of the East,‚Äù was popularized to lump all of these peoples of different nations into a single miscellaneous category that erased their individual ancient histories and cultures that spanned thousands of years of life and tradition, replete with countless and invaluable achievements in their respective nations. Before Israel, Jews of Iraq identified as Iraqi, of Morocco as Moroccan, of Tunisia as Tunisian, of Iran as Persian, of Syria as Syrian, of Egypt as Egyptian, and of Palestine as Palestinian. They spoke Arabic, ate the same foods as their Christian and Muslim compatriots, celebrated and partook in the same national events and traditions, lived by the same social protocols, and moved through their respective cultures as other natives did. And despite the similarities of their cultures, Tunisians were distinct from Egyptians, who were both distinct from Iraqis, who were distinct from Moroccans, etc. But Israel collapsed them all under a single identity, which was to be distinguished only from Ashkenazis, European Jews, who were higher up on the social order, and, of course, from non-Jewish Palestinians and Arabs, who were to be despised.

facebook,"INTERCONNECTED FOUNDATIONS: EXPLORING THE LINK BETWEEN LITERACY, PEACE, SECURITY, AND COUNTRY STABILITY 2023 National Literacy Conference Cebu City Mga kababayan, ladies and gentlemen, Assalamualaikum. Madayaw ug maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan. Magandang araw sa inyong lahat. Today, I would like to emphasize the crucial role of literacy in unlocking opportunities, empowering individuals, and driving our nation forward. The Department of Education stands at the forefront, paving the way for literacy development in our country through various programs and initiatives. Our goal is to promote functional literacy and ensure that every Filipino possesses the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in today's complex world. Functional literacy goes beyond simply reading and writing. It encompasses the skills necessary to apply this knowledge in real-life situations. It equips individuals with the ability to make informed decisions, communicate effectively, and actively participate in the workforce and society. To enhance functional literacy across all levels of education, the Department of Education has taken significant steps. Let me highlight some of the key initiatives undertaken by DepEd: First, the implementation of the K to 12 Program. This is one of the most notable reforms in our educational system. It provides a holistic and well-rounded education and emphasizes functional literacy through the incorporation of practical life skills, work education, and entrepreneurship in the curriculum. The recent revision of the K to 10 curriculum under the MATATAG Curriculum ensures the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, good manners, right conduct, peace education, and other essential skills. This revision acknowledges the evolving demands of the 21st century, where learners must analyze complex issues and adapt to rapidly changing environments. Second, we have the Alternative Learning Systems (ALS) program, which offers education to out-of-school youth and adults. ALS has significantly expanded access to education for those who may have missed formal schooling, providing not only basic literacy skills but also life skills. This program empowers marginalized individuals, promotes social inclusion, and offers them a chance to earn a formal diploma, leading to improved job prospects and increased self-esteem. Third, to ensure that school leaders and teachers are well-equipped to teach functional literacy, the Department of Education invests in teacher training and development programs. We contribute to the professional development of teachers through training programs, workshops, and seminars that enhance their teaching methods and keep them updated with the latest educational trends and approaches. Furthermore, DepEd actively collaborates with various organizations and stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector, to promote functional literacy. These partnerships aid in the development of educational materials, access to resources, and the implementation of innovative teaching methods. Through the Literacy Coordinating Council (LCC), the Department of Education strengthens its commitment to work with legislators and local government units (LGUs) to strengthen relevant policies and literacy support structures at the grassroots level. To date, more than 300 Local LCCs have been established by LGUs, ensuring community literacy mapping out in identifying out-of-school children, youth, and adults, and provide relevant literacy program interventions. Recognizing the outstanding efforts of partners and stakeholders in community-based literacy development, the LCC has awarded more than 300 LGUs and NGOs through its National Literacy Awards (NLA) program. Let me highlight an inspiring success story from the NLA winners: the Municipality of Kauswagan in Lanao Del Norte. The LCC recognized their outstanding literacy intervention called the ""From Battle Ground to School Ground.‚Äù This program has seen a scaled-up response in skills and literacy in conflict-affected areas, transforming communities into productive zones with sustained peace. It has successfully engaged both Muslim and Christian individuals, young and old, and improved the lives of many. This story exemplifies the contributions of LGUs in improving literacy rates and making a difference in the lives of Filipinos. Moreover, the LCC has developed literacy-related policies, frameworks, standards, and tools based on extensive research and empirical evidence. With the support of the Philippine Normal University, research and development work of the LCC has flourished.

facebook,"15 lessons from Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ by Daniel Goleman: 1. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. 2. EI is just as important for success in life as IQ, and perhaps even more so. 3. EI consists of five key skills: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. 4. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions. 5. Self-regulation is the ability to manage your emotions and impulses. 6. Motivation is the ability to set and achieve goals. 7. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. 8. Social skills are the ability to build and maintain relationships. 9. EI can be learned and improved over time. 10. EI can help you succeed in all areas of your life, including your personal relationships, your career, and your health. 11. EI can help you make better decisions. When you are aware of your own emotions and the emotions of others, you are better able to weigh all of the factors involved in a decision. 12. EI can help you resolve conflict more effectively. When you can understand and empathize with the other person's perspective, you are more likely to find a solution that works for everyone. 13. EI can help you build stronger relationships. When you are able to communicate your own emotions clearly and understand the emotions of others, you are more likely to build trust and intimacy. 14. EI can help you manage stress and anxiety. When you are able to identify and manage your own emotions, you are better able to cope with stressful situations. 15. EI can lead to better physical health. Studies have shown that people with high EI are less likely to suffer from heart disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. How to improve your emotional intelligence: ‚Ä¢ Pay attention to your emotions. Notice how you feel throughout the day and try to identify the triggers that cause your emotions to change. ‚Ä¢ Label your emotions. Once you can identify your emotions, put a name to them. This will help you to better understand what you are feeling and why. ‚Ä¢ Manage your emotions. Once you understand your emotions, you can develop strategies for managing them in a healthy way. For example, if you are feeling angry, you might try taking a few deep breaths or going for a walk. ‚Ä¢ Empathize with others. Try to put yourself in the shoes of others and see things from their perspective. This will help you to better understand their feelings and motivations. ‚Ä¢ Develop your social skills. Practice communicating effectively, building relationships, and resolving conflict. There are many resources available to help you improve your emotional intelligence. You can find books, articles, and even online courses on the topic. You can also work with a therapist or coach to develop your EI skills.

facebook,"""Dr. Faustus"" is a famous play by Christopher Marlowe. It's a classic of English literature, and a detailed critical analysis would involve examining various aspects of the play, such as its themes, characters, and literary techniques. 1. **Themes**: - The Struggle for Knowledge: The central theme is Faustus' insatiable desire for knowledge and the consequences of his pursuit. It's a cautionary tale about the limits of human ambition. - The Conflict between Good and Evil: The play explores the eternal struggle between good and evil through the characters of Faustus, Mephistopheles, and the Good and Evil Angels. - The Tragic Hero: Faustus can be seen as a tragic hero, driven by a fatal flaw (his ambition) and doomed to a tragic fate. 2. **Characters**: - Dr. Faustus: Analyze his character development, his internal conflicts, and the choices he makes. - Mephistopheles: Examine his role as both a servant and tempter. - The Good and Evil Angels: They represent the moral conflict faced by Faustus. 3. **Literary Techniques**: - Soliloquies and Monologues: Marlowe uses these to delve into Faustus' thoughts and emotions. - Allegory: The play is rich in allegorical elements, like the characters of the Seven Deadly Sins. - Use of Blank Verse: Marlowe's use of blank verse, unrhymed lines of iambic pentameter, is noteworthy. 4. **Historical and Social Context**: - Consider the play's historical context, including the Elizabethan era's views on magic and knowledge. 5. **The Tragic Element**: - Discuss how ""Dr. Faustus"" adheres to the classical elements of a tragic play, such as the downfall of the protagonist and the cathartic effect on the audience. 6. **Religious and Morality Aspects**: - Analyze the religious undertones in the play and how it reflects the moral values of the time. 7. **Influences and Impact**: - Explore how Marlowe's work might have influenced later literature, especially the portrayal of Faustian bargains in literature. A detailed critical analysis would involve a deep dive into these aspects, providing textual evidence to support your analysis and considering different interpretations of the play. It's a work that has been studied and analyzed extensively, so there are many different critical perspectives to explore.",,4889,"{'like_count': 3484, 'comment_count': 185, 'num_users': 100284}",English literature,,2023-10-13 08:38:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/299528495_445026350972793_8155050084057353263_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=FZZjUKsCdGkAX-fn84k&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDzC_yVQ2jKafXX78aNohn8jkCdKuosROGtB2DFc7a9hg&oe=655ACA0C,https://www.facebook.com/100063962958074/posts/731011125707646,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391628474_731011092374316_806741969317662247_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=vIRvXLEgJXQAX9mNk3B&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCV0a41LmccDEm111NX83jpgjg0cngSQncr03_VHQIbjg&oe=6531D1E5

This is a kind of complexity you can see when you stand thousands of kilometers from the conflict. But for the people on the ground it is impossible: Hamas is trying to sow seeds of hatred in its psychological warfare. Hopefully we can sow seeds that ‚Äì while they won't give any fruit right now, maybe in a few decades ‚Äì will make it possible to reconcile. Starting with the release of all the hostages. We tend to only remember the atrocities, but it is possible for these kinds of reconciliations to happen, and there are several examples from history.

facebook,"I've decided to take a step back tonight from Fish on Friday as after all the horrors on the news this last week I think a pause for thought is in order especially with emotions running high and the danger of misinterpretation. I'm shocked as I think we all are at the barbarity and extremism that is attempting to polarise judgement and I don't want to be drawn into it accidentally or otherwise. The total lack of humanity that I've observed and heard is sickening and has deeply disturbed me these last few days. It's a time to contemplate and for rational and careful thought in the middle of all this madness so I am holding my own counsel on it all and declining to be drawn in to comment. I think you will understand. I've been texting Elliot 'Ness' Singerman these last few days and most of you will know him as the house engineer here at the Studio and producer of 'Raingods with Zippos', 'Fellini Days' and 'Field of Crows'. He went to Israel after that last album to live and work in the live music industry in Tel Aviv. Elliot has lost a number of good friends and co workers these last days and as you'd expect is both angry and extremely saddened by the turn of events. We are both depressed at the total lack of humanity on exhibition and where the world we live on is headed . He said that for the last year he has seen this coming as the politics drove ever further to the right and religious extremism became more lunatic. The one song he couldn't get out of his head was 'The Perception of Johnny Punter'. Maybe listen to that tonight on your own and take it in . Born in Bosnia in the ever glowing embers of division and the endless circles of generations baptised in hatred, the opening words there to paint out the tribes and the cultural racism that is always hidden beneath the surface that can ignite conflict and wars on a breath of utterance. Living on the planet - we are - in another world I'll leave it at that I'll be back next week and will have news of the 2024 tour which is about to be officially announced and of the '13th Star' and Feast of Consequences' triple vinyl box sets that will be going up on preorder on the 30th October.

Nu a avut »ôi nu are idei »ôi planuri concrete de dezvoltare, modernizare »ôi construc»õie. De la apari»õie, PAS a fost o for»õƒÉ de atac »ôi distrugere. √énsƒÉ, PAS nu atacƒÉ probleme, ci oameni. PAS nu ajutƒÉ oamenii sƒÉ devinƒÉ mai buni, mai eficien»õi, mai corec»õi. PAS atacƒÉ oamenii, √Æi umile»ôte, demotiveazƒÉ, subordoneazƒÉ, blocheazƒÉ, asupre»ôte, dezbinƒÉ »ôi alungƒÉ. PAS nu este un partid »ôi nu comunicƒÉ cu societatea. PAS desconsiderƒÉ societatea. PAS nu este un partid »ôi nu are un dialog intern. PAS √Æ»ôi asupre»ôte membrii »ôi le cere supunere oarbƒÉ. PAS este un fenomen social periculos, care serve»ôte o persoanƒÉ »ôi satisface dorin»õele personale ale d√¢nsei. √én paralel, al»õi, foarte pu»õini, cei mai importan»õi capi ai PAS, √Æ»ôi mai satisfac »ôi ni»ôte dorin»õe personale de-ale lor. PAS nu cunoa»ôte compasiune, milƒÉ »ôi dragoste fa»õƒÉ de oameni. Aceste calitƒÉ»õi sunt √Æn conflict direct cu ADN-ul PAS, bazat pe egoism, pe autoapreciere »ôi pe arogan»õƒÉ. PAS √Æ»ôi apƒÉrƒÉ agresiv dreptul la egoism, autoapreciere »ôi arogan»õƒÉ, de aceste motive √Æn permanen»õƒÉ atacƒÉ oameni »ôi pƒÉreri. Astfel se explicƒÉ derapajele dictatoriale ale PAS »ôi e»ôecul lor pe toate dimensiunile: √Æn economie, √Æn finan»õe publice, √Æn justi»õie, √Æn administrare socialƒÉ, pe dimensiunea demograficƒÉ. Astfel se explicƒÉ cƒÉutarea vinova»õilor √Æn afara cercului PAS ‚Äì c√¢nd de fapt, de peste 2 ani PAS are toatƒÉ puterea »ôi ia toate deciziile √Æn Republica Moldova. Astfel se explicƒÉ de ce PAS nu vede nimic imoral √Æn cre»ôterea salariilor mini»ôtrilor de la 25 000 lei p√¢nƒÉ la 75 000 lei, iar a pensiilor de la 2 000 la 2 300 lei. PAS nu se va schimba. ƒÇsta este ADN-ul PAS. PAS nu poate fi altfel iar noi, societatea Republicii Moldova, urmeazƒÉ sƒÉ √Æn»õelegem amenin»õƒÉrile grave ale acestui fenomen. SƒÉ ne pregƒÉtim de tratarea efectelor acestui fenomen distrugƒÉtor, care deja a afectat puternic poten»õialul nostru social, demografic »ôi economic. »òi sƒÉ ne pregƒÉtim pentru a preveni √Æn viitor ajungerea la putere a fenomenelor de acest gen. Theodore Roosevelt, unul din Pre»ôedin»õii SUA, a spus c√¢ndva: ‚ÄúA educa mintea unui om, fƒÉrƒÉ a-l educa moral »ôi spiritual - √ÆnseamnƒÉ a educa o amenin»õare pentru societate‚Äù. Mesajul transmis de Theodore Roosevelt este unul larg »ôi vizeazƒÉ inclusiv, »ôi √Æn special, puterea publicƒÉ. Puterea nu face oamenii mai buni, sau mai rƒÉi. Oamenii ajun»ôi √Æn birourile publice mari, folosesc instrumentele puterii √Æn func»õie de educa»õia lor moralƒÉ »ôi spiritualƒÉ. Ori √Æn func»õie de lipsa acesteia. SƒÉ fie clar. Nu m-am referit »ôi nu mƒÉ refer la valorile morale »ôi sociale ale Dnei Maia Sandu, √Æn calitate de cetƒÉ»õean obi»ônuit. Or, Pre»ôedinta RM, fiind »ôi conducƒÉtorul PAS, nu este cetƒÉ»õean obi»ônuit. Agenda Pre»ôedintei RM, deciziile d√¢nsei, ac»õiunile »ôi inac»õiunile dnei Pre»ôedintƒÉ, au impact asupra fiecƒÉrui cetƒÉ»õean al Republicii Moldova. »òi atunci c√¢nd √Æn biroul Pre»ôedintei RM existƒÉ un deficit de compasiune, de milƒÉ »ôi de dragoste fa»õƒÉ de oameni - deficitul √Æl simt »ôi √Æl plƒÉtesc to»õi locuitorii Republicii Moldova. C√¢nd √Æn biroul Pre»ôedintei RM existƒÉ prea mult egoism »ôi prea multƒÉ autoapreciere - acestea le simt »ôi le plƒÉtesc to»õi locuitorii Republicii Moldova. C√¢nd √Æn biroul Pre»ôedintei RM domne»ôte arogan»õa »ôi incompeten»õa - o simt to»õi locuitorii Republicii Moldova. Anul acesta, apoi √Æn 2024 »ôi √Æn 2025, avem posibilitatea sƒÉ √ÆnlƒÉturƒÉm de la putere fenomenul PAS »ôi sƒÉ √ÆnvƒÉ»õƒÉm lec»õiile. Lec»õii, care deja ne-au costat prea mult, »ôi √ÆncƒÉ ne vor mai costa. √éntre timp, Republica Moldova √ÆncƒÉ mai are oameni competen»õi »ôi cu o educa»õie moralƒÉ »ôi spiritualƒÉ valoroasƒÉ. Republica Moldova √ÆncƒÉ mai are putere intelectualƒÉ, care poate genera o putere economicƒÉ suficientƒÉ, pentru a asigura un nivel decent de bunƒÉstare pentru to»õi cei care locuiesc √Æn Republica Moldova.

facebook,"Your life needs only to make sense to you. It's a personal journey, not a community project. If you were accustomed to getting your parents' approval for everything you did and they never taught you freedom and self-determination, you'll find yourself waiting for approval from authority figures in your life. When you imagine going ahead without a nod from whoever you're submitting yourself to at that time, you will feel intense stress and anxiety. This is learned dependency and fear of facing life by yourself. Since people have a conflict of interest, they will mislead and confuse you to keep you under their control. The more you mature, the more you become comfortable with living a life people don't understand. And the more become centred and in control of your life, the less permission and approval you need from other people. One thing you should do when you turn thirty is to retire all authority figures in your life and become the authority figure yourself. You're socially and psychologically mature now, and you must not have external supervision or undue influence in your life. You will continue to learn and borrow wisdom from many sources, of course, but you will be making decisions yourself. You will appreciate those who contributed to your growth in the past, but you will take full control of your life moving forward. Some will hate your declaration of independence and evict you from their communities. You should take this merely as a confirmation that their role in your life is over because they can not accommodate a grown and self-reliant you. They needed you to stay weak and controllable. You don't need them anymore.

Just when I was thinking of proposing to her, a thought crossed my mind ""We have never quarrelled before, are you sure we can cope with the conflict that comes with marriage?"" I asked myself... Funny enough, I tried sparking up arguments whenever she visited, complained bitterly about anything she did but it didn't work She would either tell me ""I'm sorry my love, you know I didn't mean to offend you"" and smile that her irresistible smile and before I realise, I would be smiling myself... Or she would look at me with her baby face until I apologize. She never shouted back or spoke rudely...until one day, I made the mistake of asking her why she never picked a quarrel ""You never shout or speak back at me, you're always too cool...I don't know if you will even be able to handle conflict in marriage sef..."" I complained She looked at me, shocked and surprised at the same time... ""So you want us to be quarreling?"" She asked ""No, but...you know, arguments bring better understanding in relationships"" I explained bluntly ""You think I don't understand you enough?"" She asked, still calm By then I realised I was just being stupid...I kept mute ""No problem, you've asked for it"" she said Gbam. I started apologizing immediately but she gave deaf ears...a part of still wanted the drama to happen so I left her alone after pleading for some time I left for my room and waited for her to come and meet me but she stayed in the living room for almost an hour...

facebook,"Machik Labdr√∂n üôè ‚ÄúPeople these days use whatever little dharma they know to augment afflictive emotion, and then engender tremendous pride and conceit over it. They teach the Dharma without taming their own minds. But as with a river rock , not even a hair‚Äôs tip of benefit penetrates the other people. Even worse, incorrigible people [are attracted] to this dharma that increases conflict. When individuals who could be tamed by the Dharma encounter such incorrigible, their desire for the sacred Dharma is lost. It is not the fault of the Dharma; it is the fault of individuals... **** Training Homage to the host of lamas, yidams, and dakinƒ±s. Bowing at the feet of the mother, the nonmortal, the dakinƒ±, I have arranged this complete explanation of casting out the body as food according to Machik‚Äôs own teachings. First, a brief explanation of Machik‚Äôs history. Previous Life in India Machik is the dakinƒ± of timeless wisdom, the birth mother of all past, present, and future buddhas. She is the vajra dakini of the mind family. With the intention to help sentient beings, she took birth [in her previous life] as the son of King Srƒ±sura Arya in Kapila in India. The young prince was called M√∂nlam Drup. He learned to read and write all the sets of letters and all other sciences with barely any studying, just by hearing or seeing them. From the age of five he could understand everything without hindrance. Everybody said that he must be an emanation of the Buddha. At the age of ten, he took monastic ordination with Pandita Pƒ±tibhadra and received the name D√∂ndrup Zangpo. He stayed with this master for three years, during which time he became more learned in grammar, logic, paramita, vinaya, and abhidharma collections than even the master himself. The master realized that he was an exceptionally talented person and so taught him the Four Tantras, in which he became particularly adept. In the presence of his master he assiduously studied the collections of scriptures (pitakas), and even made many clarifications in the Four Tantras. Most important, he offered the realizations that had arisen in his own mind. The master was utterly pleased and said, ‚ÄúD√∂ndrup Zangpo, I am not capable of being your master any longer. Now you should go north to Zangling (Tamradvipa). Guru Ratna lives there. He is a great adept of Cakrasamvara and is actually able to manifest the emanated mandala. He is learned in all the scriptures and is adorned with all good qualities. Go to him and work through all your doubts. Practice the Highest Secret Mantra and become an adept. You will help many sentient beings.‚Äù The next day D√∂ndrup Zangpo arrived before Guru Ratna. Guru Ratna could see that he was a worthy recipient and emanated the mandala of the sixty-four deities of Cakrasa¬™vara in the sky in front of him. The four empowerments were bestowed in their entirety, and D√∂ndrup Zangpo attained supreme spiritual powers (siddhi). He could travel through the pure realms of the buddhas without obstruction. He stayed with this master for three years and resolved his misconceptions concerning all the teachings of sutra and tantra. In particular, he became learned and adept in the stages of creation and completion in Highest [Secret Mantra]. Then the master told him, ‚ÄúYou should go north to the Vajra Seat at Bodhgaya and convert the heretics. There is no one able to debate as well as you.‚Äù So when he was sixteen years old, D√∂ndrup Zangpo went to Bodhgaya and debated with the heretics. They were defeated, and one hundred thousand of them entered the Buddhist order. D√∂ndrup Zangpo stayed in Bodhgaya for four years. Then Exalted Tara told him that he must go to Tibet to help the beings there. ‚ÄúHurry up and get accomplished!‚Äù she said. He decided that he should visit some sacred places and set out to the north. He came to a cemetery, and as soon as he lay down to rest, a dakinƒ± of that charnel ground appeared. She was wearing bone ornaments and carrying a hooked knife and a trident. She said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have anywhere to rest besides my cemetery?‚Äù and then conjured up all kinds of apparitions. But he overcame them with his meditative absorption (samadhi), and the dakinƒ± offered her life-essence and pledged herself to the Dharma. At dawn, he beheld the faces of the fifteen goddesses of Nairatmya, who said to him, ‚ÄúYogin, go to Potari and quickly become accomplished and then go on to Tibet.‚Äù Then they vanished like a rainbow.

facebook,"Dear Friends of the International Plum Village Community, Our hearts are breaking as we witness the horrific violence that is being unleashed in many parts of the world and most recently in the Middle East: in Israel and in Gaza. We know that both Palestinians and Israelis are our siblings‚Äîour brothers, sisters, children, our family‚Äîwho are being killed, and who are driven to kill. In an atmosphere of violence, accusation and retaliation, we have a tendency to dehumanize the other. Once anger, fear, and suspicion take over, it seems like there is nothing to do besides kill or be killed. Today we shed tears as we witness our Israeli and Palestinian siblings dying, sustaining severe injuries‚Äîboth psychological and physical‚Äîand losing loved ones in the hate-fueled attacks of the very few. Violence can only lead to more violence and diminish any possibility of dialogue and reconciliation‚Äîunless we go deeply within ourselves to see that human beings are not our enemy. We need a coalition of wise and courageous people‚Äîin Gaza, West Bank, Israel and in the international community‚Äîwho refuse to give in to this hate: a non-violent army. It is time for violence in all its many forms to end in the Holy Land. With compassion, love, and wisdom in our hearts we can make ourselves available to listen deeply to the cries of those now in Gaza and Israel and elsewhere in the world‚Äîthe cries of those undergoing the deep mental crisis of being trapped in a conflict zone, who are looking to keep their love strong in the midst of this horror. We need to lend them our strength. We all need to go beyond the delusive and destructive idea that we are separate from each other. Let us create islands of non-violence and peace in our hearts, in our homes and beyond, via email, phone and video. Let us live every moment seeing those we think of as the enemy as not separate from ourselves‚Äîas our own blood, skin and bones‚Äîand let us not allow hatred to take over. Let us come back and take care of our feelings with calm and clarity, holding our sadness, fear, anger, and despair and resist the temptation to blame, punish, and have to choose a side. This meditation may be challenging at this moment but it is what we as a collective need now in order to awaken from the madness and destruction. Revenge and punishment cannot be the answer. Join us to generate this imperturbable compassion in your own heart, and radiate it out in every direction to our siblings experiencing great loss, fear and pain in this moment. The war is complex and difficult to stop, but it is also impermanent. Its cessation now depends on our capacity, as human beings, to listen deeply, resist polarization and discrimination, and take concrete steps towards lasting reconciliation with love in our hearts. Love, compassion, and courage need to have a place in politics. With love for all beings suffering in the hell of war, The Plum Village International Monastic Community",,1712,"{'like_count': 542, 'comment_count': 113, 'num_users': 2071481}",Thich Nhat Hanh,,2023-10-13 21:55:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/238948231_383368466491388_8124182092307977821_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XuYI1FsLajsAX8y-4jy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfALfshATVpEbG8T7o5fAsA9Er8pl2180m_9H9bw_EVKOg&oe=655B23B5,https://www.facebook.com/100044547124554/posts/876708843824012,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/16737295657499163106?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deerparkmonastery.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F10%2FScreenshot-2023-10-13-at-9.22.06%E2%80%AFAM.png&fb_obo=1&utld=deerparkmonastery.org&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbHbBGTJrmMBxpZ2SGD4-t2DEwVp1Be7wBxuvRYTTRJyTQ&oe=6556CC81

Scriptures to stand on: Ex 23:1, Pro 11:1, 1 King 22:19-23. DEVOTION: There is need for the body of Christ to rise up against the spirit of falsehood. The spirit of falsehood has a tendency of promoting hatred, bitterness and conflict in a nation. A nation that is influenced by falsehood cannot make huge progress. Citizens are provoked and mislead to do wicked things by falsehood. Any nation that is full of falsehood is fathered by the devil because where falsehood is, there devil is also present. Terminate this spirit today. DECLARATION OF THE DAY I decree that you shall not die In Jesus name. PRAYER POINTS: 1. Witchcraft agents releasing spell of falsehood over this nation, terminate, In Jesus name. 2. I bind the manifestation of falsehood in this nation, In Jesus name. 3. Powers assigned to silence truth in this nation, terminate, In Jesus name. 4. O you ears of the citizens of this nation reject falsehood, In Jesus name. 5.

facebook,"The symbolism of Ravana‚Äôs 10 heads Every year, Sanatanis (Hindus) around the world celebrate Deepawali, a festival that commemorates Prince Sri Rama‚Äôs return to his home, Ayodhya, after defeating the powerful King Ravana. Presented as the victory of good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and spiritual light over darkness, narrations of their conflict often convey Ravana as a one-dimensional figure, whose heinous acts, including the kidnapping of Devi Sita, slate him as irredeemably demonic. No matter how terrible a person appears, however, Sanatan Dharma teaches that nobody is ever completely evil. Ultimately, everyone originates from the Divine, and so everyone is actually pure in nature. Often caught up in the dualities of life ‚Äî like hot/cold, ugly/beautiful, and old/young ‚Äî many have a tendency to forget this nature, as they do all they can to attain what they want and avoid what they don‚Äôt want, despite how their actions might affect those around them. Hence, like all, Ravana was a complex being, who exhibited not only negative qualities, but positive ones throughout his life‚Äôs journey. An expert warrior, politician, king, as well as astrologer and doctor of ayurveda, he took great care of his kingdom, for even the poorest of its inhabitants were well off, and never poverty stricken. Also an exceptional poet and scholar, each of the 10 heads he is often depicted with are said to symbolize the six shastras and four vedas, as he was a famed devotee of Shiva, the God of Transformation. But, like many before him, and many after, he was led astray in his desire for pleasure, succumbing to a medley of life‚Äôs vices in his pursuit of so-called happiness. Thus, as his hunger for power expanded, his 10 heads of knowledge became better known as symbols of the 10 qualities that exude those who are attached to such power. They are: Kama (lust) Krodha (anger) Moha (delusion) Lobha (greed) Mada (pride) Maatsarya (envy) Buddhi (intellect) Manas (mind) Chitta (will) Ahamkara (ego) According to the Bhagavad Gita, success in spiritual life depends on a steady intelligence, which can only exist through control of the senses. When we focus too much on an object of the senses, attachment develops. Prolonged attachment turns into intense longing, or lust, and when the object of our lust is not obtained, anger arises. Becoming blinded by anger, we fall into delusion, causing bewilderment and a loss of intelligence, as we lose sight of our true spiritual identity. In the case of Ravana, Devi Sita was the object of his senses. Controlled by lust, he took her by force and grew angry when she refused to be with him. Blinded by his anger, he lost all intelligence, believing he could defeat her husband Sri Rama, an avatar of Sri Vishnu, who inevitably killed him. Good and evil, like everything in the material world, are relative, and have no real meaning in connection to divine figures like Rama and Sita. Therefore, a true characterization of Ravana is not that he was a demon, but that he was a person who failed to control his senses, going down a path that led to forgetfulness of his real spiritual identity. As such, to avoid going down a similar path, we must all strive to act selflessly by controlling our senses, practicing discipline in pursuit of spiritual advancement, rather than our own selfish desires. By such discipline, we can transcend mundane notions of good and evil, and see every person for what they truly are ‚Äî magnificent and beautiful expressions of the Divine.

facebook,"Jeremy Corbyn writing for the Tribune today: ‚ÄúI utterly condemn the attacks on civilians, Israeli and Palestinian. And I plead with politicians across the globe to do all they can to stop any further loss of human life. Our political leaders surely must understand that, without a serious political intervention, one tragedy will follow another, and a cycle of despair will go on and on. In the immediate aftermath of horror, we need voices for peace and de-escalation. Instead, inconceivably, both major political parties continue to give the green light to an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. Both the Foreign Secretary and Shadow Foreign Secretary have reiterated their support for Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúright to defend itself‚Äù, yet consistently fail to offer sufficient specificity about what this means, let alone how it should be exercised within the boundaries of international law. In an interview with LBC, Keir Starmer was asked whether ‚Äúcutting off power and water‚Äù to 2 million people, half of whom are children, was appropriate. He agreed that Israel ‚Äúhas that right‚Äù. Where is the empathy for Palestinians who have lost their loved ones, their homes and their futures? What happened to the universal application of international law? We may be witnessing the beginning of the total annihilation of Gaza and its people. This is not a battle between one state and another. It is couched as an Israeli response to a non-state actor, but in fact it is a response to Palestinian people wherever they are. What is unfolding is not a conflict of equals, but the systematic starvation, subjugation and destruction of an unarmed civilian population. I wonder, if Gaza is wiped off the face of the earth, whether our politicians will look back and reflect on the reality of their unwavering support. If they had any integrity, they would mourn the innocent Palestinian lives that have been erased in the name of self-defence. They should be ashamed of their cowardice, knowing that others will pay the price for the war crimes they refuse to oppose.‚Äù",,850,"{'like_count': 435, 'comment_count': 158, 'num_users': 258198}",The Daily Politik,,2023-10-13 09:03:11,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/308461727_463596805812291_5374646072043743554_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=AmOFWfawwXUAX9Rq_vm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCgGG1PcT5NDK0Z00iAiLkxFUJhGslVsg2mZDbdaqWajQ&oe=655B1E25,https://www.facebook.com/100064859254076/posts/738629828308986,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/4383325762764344966?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.jacobinmag.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F4%2F2023%2F10%2F12100855%2FGettyImages-1233090336.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=jacobinmag.com&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbEiBR6WpjW3qxvJY_tHc8k8o_3qNCzqC-cVYFYnk1d9PQ&oe=65444FE7
facebook,"We, members of the undersigned human rightsand civil society organizations in Israel, are shocked and horrified in these dreadful days. Hamas‚Äô horrific crimes against innocent civilians - including children, women, and the elderly - have shaken us all, and we are struggling to recover from the unbearable sights and sounds. Some of us were in the Israeli communities on the Gaza border during the assault; many of us have family, friends, and colleagues who endured and are still in the midst of the harrowing events; and we all know people who were murdered, injured, or abducted. It will take time to fully understand the implications and consequences of Hamas‚Äô heinous attack, for which there can be no justification. Most of our teams include Israelis and Palestinians; therefore, some of us have relatives and colleagues in Gaza currently living under the ongoing assault of the Israeli military. Children, women, and the elderly are being indiscriminately attacked with nowhere to hide. Even now ‚Äì especially now ‚Äì we must maintain our moral and humane position and refuse to give in to despair or the urge for vengeance. Keeping our faith in the human spirit and its inherent goodness is more vital than ever. One thing is clear: We will never surrender our belief in humanity - even now, when doing so is more challenging than ever. Having always opposed the harming of innocent civilians, it remains our duty in these terrible times - as we count our dead on the Israeli side and worry about wounded, missing, and abducted loved ones, and as bombs are being dropped on residential neighborhoods in Gaza, wiping out entire families with no possibility of burying the dead ‚Äì to raise our voices loud and clear against the harming of all innocent civilians, both in Israel and Gaza. We call for the immediate release of all hostages and an end to the bombardment of civilians in Israel and in Gaza. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to reach civilian populations, medical facilities and places of refuge must not be harmed, and vital resources such as water and electricity must not be cut off. The killing of additional civilians will not bring back those who were lost. Indiscriminate destruction and a siege harming innocents will not bring relief, justice, or calm. As individuals working to promote human rights and who believe in the sanctity of life, we urgently call for an end to all indiscriminate harming of civilian lives and infrastructure. We call for negotiations and all possible action to be taken to bring about the release of the hostages - while prioritizing the civilians held by Hamas. It is the only humane and rational thing to do, and it must be done now.

facebook,"FOR THOSE COMPARING BIAFRA TO GAZA OR PALESTINE, READ THIS ACCOUNT By @giniedze (c)nefertari @DGiantOfAfrica If Israel just allowed the Palestinians to have a state of their own, there would be peace in the Middle East, right? That's what you hear from you and ambassadors, European diplomats, and most college professors. But what if I told you that Israel has already offered the Palestinians a state of their own, and not just once, but on five separate occasions? Don't believe me? Let's review the record. After the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, following World War I, Britain took control of most of the Middle East, including the area that constitutes modern Israel. 17 years later, in 1936, the Arabs rebelled against the British and against the Jewish neighbors The British formed a task force, the Peal Commission, to study the cause of the rebellion. The Commission concluded that the reason for the violence was that two peoples, Jews and Arabs, wanted to govern the same land. The answer, the Peal Commission concluded, would be to create two independent states, one for the Jews and one for the Arabs, a two-state solution. Rejection number one. The suggested split was heavily in favor of the Arabs. The British offered them 80% of the disputed territory, the Jews the remaining 20%. Yet, despite the tiny size of their proposed state, the Jews voted to accept this offer. But the Arabs rejected it and resumed their violent rebellion. Rejection number two. Ten years later, in 1947, the British asked the United Nations to find a new solution to the continuing tensions. Like the Peal Commission, the UN decided that the best way to resolve the conflict was to divide the land. In November 1947, the UN voted to create two states. Again, the Jews accepted the offer and again, the Arabs rejected it. Only this time, they did so by launching an all-out war. Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria joined the conflict. But they failed. Israel won the war and got on with the business of building a new nation. Most of the land set aside by the UN for an Arab state, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, became occupied territory. Occupied not by Israel, but by Jordan. Rejection number three. 20 years later, in 1967, the Arabs led this time by Egypt and joined by Syria and Jordan, once again sought to destroy the Jewish state. The 1967 conflict, known as the Six-Day War, ended in a stunning victory for Israel. Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as the area known as the Gaza Strip, fell into Israel's hands. The government split over what to do with this new territory. Half wanted to return the West Bank to Jordan and Gaza to Egypt in exchange for peace. The other half wanted to give it to the region's Arabs, who had begun referring to themselves as the Palestinians, in the hope that they would ultimately build their own state there. Neither initiative got very far. A few months later, the Arab League met in Sudan and issued its infamous three-NOs, no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with Israel. Again, a two-state solution was dismissed by the Arabs. Rejection number four. In 2000, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met at Camp David, with Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Nasser Arafat, to conclude a new two-state plan. Barak offered Arafat a Palestinian state in all of Gaza, and 94% of the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital. But the Palestinian leader rejected the offer. In the words of U.S. President Bill Clinton, ""Arafat was here 14 days and said no to everything."" Instead, the Palestinians launched a bloody wave of suicide bombings that killed over 1,000 Israelis and maimed thousands more, on buses, in wedding halls, and in pizza parlors. Rejection number five. In 2008, Israel tried yet again. Prime Minister Ehud Omar went even further than Ehud Barak had, expanding the peace offer to include additional land to sweeten the deal. Like his predecessor, the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, turned the deal down. In between these last two Israeli offers, Israel unilaterally left Gaza, giving the Palestinians complete control there. Instead of developing this territory for the good of its citizens, the Palestinians turned Gaza into a terrorist base, from which they have fired thousands of rockets into Israel. Each time Israel has agreed to a Palestinian state, the Palestinians have rejected the offer, often violently. So if you're interested in peace in the Middle East, maybe the answer is not to pressure Israel to make yet another offer of the state to the Palestinians. Maybe the answer is to pressure the Palestinians to finally accept the existence of a Jewish state. Credit: @giniedze That‚Äôs it. And when Israel fights back.

facebook,"Isra√´l wil in √©√©n dag meer Palestijnen uit hun huizen en land verdrijven dan het deed tijdens de hele Nakba van 1948. Meer dan 1,1 miljoen Palestijnen wonen ten noorden van de rode lijn bij Wadi Ghazzah. Isra√´l wil ze allemaal in 24 uur naar het zuiden ervan verplaatsen. Verdrijven van de mensen, zoals in 1948. De Verenigde Naties (VN) spreken van een verwoestende humanitaire impact en roepen Isra√´l op om het bevel in te trekken. Dit is geen strijd tussen de ene staat en de andere. Vandaag zijn we misschien getuige van het begin van de totale vernietiging van Gaza en zijn bevolking. Wat zich ontvouwt is geen conflict tussen gelijken, maar de systematische uithongering, onderwerping en vernietiging van een burgerbevolking. De Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie (WHO) waarschuwt dat het gezondheidssysteem in de Gazastrook op een breekpunt staat. De organisatie roept op tot de onmiddellijke instelling van een humanitaire corridor om ongehinderde toegang te garanderen voor medische en humanitaire voorraden, evenals voor personeel, en de evacuatie van pati√´nten en gewonden. De Isra√´lische bombardementen op Gaza hebben sinds zaterdag 1.000 huizen met de grond gelijk gemaakt en velen in het gebied kampen met een nijpend tekort aan water, brandstof en medische voorraden, aldus het humanitaire bureau van de VN. Tenminste 88 onderwijsinstellingen zijn getroffen. De VN meldde dat alle 13 ziekenhuizen in het gebied slechts gedeeltelijk operationeel zijn vanwege ernstige tekorten aan brandstof en cruciale medische benodigdheden. De vermindering van de watertoevoer heeft geleid tot een nijpend watertekort voor meer dan 650.000 mensen in het gebied van 2,3 miljoen mensen. Rioleringssystemen zijn vernietigd, waardoor smerig afvalwater op straat terechtkomt en een gevaar vormt voor de gezondheid. Mensenrechtenexperts van de Verenigde Naties zijn scherp: ""Wij veroordelen ten zeerste de willekeurige militaire aanvallen van Isra√´l op de toch al uitgeputte Palestijnse bevolking van Gaza, bestaande uit meer dan 2,3 miljoen mensen, waarvan bijna de helft kinderen. Ze leven al 16 jaar onder een onwettige blokkade en hebben al vijf grote brute oorlogen achter de rug. Dit komt neer op collectieve bestraffing. Er is geen rechtvaardiging voor geweld dat zonder onderscheid gericht is tegen onschuldige burgers, of het nu wordt uitgevoerd door Hamas of door Isra√´lische troepen. Dit is absoluut verboden onder het internationaal recht en komt neer op een oorlogsmisdaad. Nu het aantal burgerslachtoffers door het geweld toeneemt, roepen we op tot een onmiddellijke de-escalatie van de spanningen in de regio en een effectieve reactie van de internationale gemeenschap op basis van het internationaal recht en de bescherming van gelijke rechten en de waardigheid van iedereen.""* Iedereen die ook maar enige integriteit heeft moet nu zijn stem verheffen tegen de vernietiging van Gaza, en tegen de dubbele moraal waarmee het Westen de oorlogsmisdaden van Isra√´lische bezettingsmacht verdedigt. -- * https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/israeloccupied-palestinian-territory-un-experts-deplore-attacks-civilians",,807,"{'like_count': 266, 'comment_count': 134, 'num_users': 100547}",Peter Mertens,,2023-10-13 08:16:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/275418568_518663966284365_8768464331434755331_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=_68eza4zvCIAX_8yV4C&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCAOU7E6RlT1qIXBS-8mSnFXTKxZZXXlWWoXRSRYpfmbQ&oe=655B6D21,https://www.facebook.com/100044222989634/posts/918166676334090,
facebook,"UMR Mobilizes Humanitarian Relief for Gaza Collaborates with global agencies and partners to deliver urgent aid The recent crisis in Gaza is rapidly deteriorating as the concern for access and delivery of emergency humanitarian aid steadily mounts due to restrictions and blockades. Notwithstanding the difficult logistic challenges, United Mission for Relief and Development (UMR) has intensified its commitment to delivering essential life-sustaining aid to the most affected population. UMR is actively providing on the ground life-saving support by leveraging its strategic partnerships and establishing alternative distribution methods. UMR acknowledges the complexities imposed by the current restrictions in Gaza and has established a robust strategy utilizing the influence and network of the Hashemite Charity Organization, an array of local community-based organizations (CBOs) as well as the United Nations. This collaborative approach ensures the successful procurement, distribution and delivery of critical supplies, circumventing traditional barriers that have hindered numerous relief efforts. ‚ÄúWe understand that the challenges in Gaza are multifaceted and require a dynamic, collaborative approach. Our partnerships are invaluable in navigating these complexities on the ground. Together, we‚Äôre not just delivering aid but saving lives and providing hope,‚Äù commented Dr. Abed Ayoub, CEO and President, UMR. Partnering with the Hashemite Charity Organization, UMR will hand over pharmaceutical supplies and equipment capable of serving over 100,000 medical cases in Gaza. This is valued at over $1,000,000. Additionally, UMR is procuring tents, clothing and other essential items which will be delivered to Gaza through UMR‚Äôs association with the Hashemite Charity Organization. These items are crucial in providing immediate shelter and comfort to the millions who would be displaced by the conflict or facing severe economic hardship. UMR is also engaging and negotiating with UNRWA on ways it can support and expand UNRWA‚Äôs operations and programs for those severely affected by the crisis. UMR is part of a coalition of Aid NGOs that includes Rahmah Worldwide, International Humanitarian Relief, Pious Project, Medglobal, and the Palestine Tomorrow Association. This coalition is focused on fortifying ER clinics in Gaza, an urgent need given the enormity of deaths and injuries. This coalition is also mandated to procure medicines, support operational capacities, and distribute food to injured individuals and their families amidst the crisis. While UMR will do all that it can to alleviate the suffering and reduce the pain, the need is enormous. UMR calls on the international community to recognize the gravity of the situation in Gaza and encourage other humanitarian organizations to contribute to the relief efforts through direct participation or support the initiatives currently being undertaken.

facebook,"Solidarity with Israel against Hamas‚Äô Terrorist Attacks The Stratbase ADR Institute stands with Israel as it faces inhumane terrorist attacks by Hamas. We strongly condemn these heinous acts of terrorism and impunity, which have claimed innocent lives, including women and children. These brutal actions perpetrated by a terrorist group destroy regional and global peace and stability. Any acts of terrorism and violence have no place in our rules-based international order. The Institute emphasizes that Hamas does not represent the entirety of Palestine. The infliction of suffering upon Israelis also inadvertently harms Palestinian civilians, subjecting them to the heartbreaking consequences of conflict. The escalation of violence and military action in the region has had a shattering effect on defenseless civilians caught in the crossfire. The images of devastation and loss are profound, and it is the responsibility of the international community to help prevent these innocent individuals from suffering further harm. These terrorist attacks and the loss of innocent lives cannot further escalate. We urge the Philippine government to continue harnessing all the needed resources to ensure the safety and well-being of Filipinos residing in Israel and provide utmost support to the Filipino families left behind by those whose lives have been lost. Echoing the statements of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Stratbase ADR Institute condemns the ongoing terror and violence being perpetuated by Hamas and mourns the loss of innocent lives on all sides. There is never an acceptable justification for terrorism. Our steadfast belief is that violence will not result in any enduring resolution and will only serve to reopen old grievances. We implore all parties involved to prioritize the safety and well-being of their civilian populations. In these dark times, we call upon friends, allies, and partners to unite as staunch defenders of the rules-based international order. We call for the urgent resolution of the conflict with due respect for the rule of law and human rights. The path to peace may be fraught with difficulties, but it is the only way to a brighter, more secure future for all.",,773,"{'like_count': 489, 'comment_count': 62, 'num_users': 101107}",Stratbase ADR Institute,,2023-10-13 08:18:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311670508_452680480290847_3586795920632186392_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YRMs13b_uzkAX-qA6wd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBkv0JZILoDB6XD9vWGGjU7P2C8w69rXq80USZo4d4QOw&oe=655B663E,https://www.facebook.com/100066466961709/posts/667102235515336,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387810515_667102195515340_5773992968801253009_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=A6sXBA7nNOcAX8x7Wmv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBR657veH6SLb3eWuOVzYhZCmV_RPS2E8X4stfl7-XT4Q&oe=652D50F2

facebook,"13 OCTOBER 2023 ‚Äî Statement Of Philippine Red Cross Chairman And CEO Richard J. Gordon On The Killing Of Five Emergency Medical Responders In The Line Of Duty In The Israel-Hamas War As of October 12, a total of five dedicated professionals from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent (RCRC) Movement tragically lost their lives in the line of duty in the ongoing armed conflict in Israel: an ambulance driver from Magen David Adom in Israel and four paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. The Philippine Red Cross extends its deepest condolences to the families and friends of our fellow humanitarian workers from the RCRC Movement. We express our sympathy to our colleagues at Magen David Adom and Palestinian Red Crescent Society. The principles of international humanitarian law (IHL) mandate the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during armed conflicts. Under IHL, pillage, reprisals, indiscriminate destruction of property, and the taking of hostages are prohibited. Health care must not be disrupted and put in danger even during times of emergencies, and all providers of healthcare, such as the Magen David Adom in Israel and Palestinian Red Crescent Society emergency medical responders, must be protected. We therefore salute our folks ‚Äì our brothers and sisters at the frontlines ‚Äì who are responding to the wounded, ensuring they get medical and psychosocial relief during these times. We call on all nations to respect IHL to the utmost. #NotATarget",,758,"{'like_count': 132, 'comment_count': 40, 'num_users': 1357065}",Philippine Red Cross,,2023-10-13 08:40:12,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/347814431_259396246493885_7043264094547923275_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=QhTL3S4HXxYAX9Ll-jj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDD4HI40lTzjSRjFpQUNvbcRzdnc2z-d78VchmC1zw5YQ&oe=655A3BED,https://www.facebook.com/100064321404005/posts/720286580125382,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391721630_720293126791394_723081727022272796_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XhA2zPn62OYAX8EMwR2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDA5EjkgmIqD3eoEZNzmwszvlUyTklRAEnJQuV3jbi7hw&oe=655B0EDD
facebook,"(Three minute read) Quick. What if everyone in San Francisco and Oakland was told to evacuate immediately or you might be killed. Where would you go? Especially if you had very little money. Very little food. And almost no water. That‚Äôs the situation in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government has told half of Gaza‚Äôs two million people to leave so they don‚Äôt get killed by Israeli bombs, missiles, and ground forces. I totally understand what Israel is trying to do. They want to wipe out Hamas. I get it. That attack was evil and despicable. But do you agree with Israel‚Äôs response? So far more than 1500 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli missiles. A third of those deaths were kids. And it‚Äôs only going to get worse as the war goes on. I read an opinion piece in the NYT from a reserve officer in the Israeli Defense Forces who has just been called up. Major Nir Avishai Cohen wrote: ‚ÄúPalestinians aren‚Äôt the enemy. Just like the majority of Israelis want to live a calm, peaceful and dignified life, so do Palestinians.‚Äù ‚ÄúIsraelis and Palestinians alike have been in the grip of a religious minority for decades.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn both sides, the intractable positions of a small group have dragged us into violence.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who is more cruel, or more ruthless. The ideology of both have fueled this conflict, leading to the death of too many innocent civilians.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis war will end sooner or later. I am not sure I will come back from it alive, but I do know that a minute after the war is over, both Israelis and Palestinians will have to reckon with the leaders who led them to this moment.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt the end, after all of the dead Israelis and Palestinians are buried, after we have finished washing away the rivers of blood, the people who share a home in this land will have to understand that there is no other choice but to follow the path of peace. That is where true victory lies.‚Äù I totally agree.",,756,"{'like_count': 210, 'comment_count': 270, 'num_users': 583622}",Frank Somerville,,2023-10-13 18:48:27,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/377441387_875685073918870_2055853340115819854_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=aUU9RRHzyosAX_fcIDT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA9Lpc2ELD6SEXQnGIboMLvlYmJ1yidVMpqYfbvh_0uPA&oe=655B768B,https://www.facebook.com/100044321565256/posts/893152308838813,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391767530_893151608838883_2675494956849295631_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Va3JS8LO8iMAX-VlGLo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAaeEyX5Jh_SVoElM63AUiZDTnuGKW4UlKX4buZS4OUnw&oe=6556671C

facebook,"With mass evacuations underway across Israel and Palestine to save frightened and innocent lives, families can only grab a handful of belongings ‚Äì many leaving pets and memories behind. The distressing footage circulating on social media depicts organized gunmen callously shooting vulnerable animals without reason has compelled us to undertake an urgent mission to rescue any of these animals that we can. Animals who somehow, miraculously, survived after their human families were killed are roaming the streets alone, starving, terrified, and often severely injured. Animals have no place in the war and it is our global responsibility to come together and help civilians and helpless animals alike. Our team, Let The Animals Live (LTAL), is now in the south with veterinarians, pet food, and equipment to help as many animals as possible. The most dangerous areas are inaccessible, but your donations are going to brave volunteers who are distributing supplies to animals in dire need. Your donation is crucial for this life-saving mission. When we gain access to the high-risk areas, we will make every effort to rescue the animals. Please, let‚Äôs show these animals the compassion they deserve and donate generously today: https://bit.ly/3Fc2tBC.:=:https://networkforanimals.org/donation/ It's important to emphasize that our focus is solely on providing care and assistance to animals affected by this tragic situation and that they are not part of the ongoing conflict.

facebook,"Who Wins? I have no aspirations to be a political commentator ‚Äì what a minefield that would be! I have no interest in debate about political candidates and beliefs ‚Äì another minefield with the potential to end lifelong friendships, split families and, yes, cause wars. My late mother, ever sensitive to war, would stop her kids fighting with the warning, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how wars start you know.‚Äù When she was really fed up with the bickering, she sent us outside with an instruction to, ‚ÄúSort yourselves out in the garden.‚Äù We would get into the garden, forget what started the row and end up playing ‚Äì good move, Mum! But I digress. I write about war. I am not fascinated by war in an obsessive sense, but I have been compelled over some twenty-odd years to write fiction and some non-fiction rooted in a time of war because the fallout of conflict and the impact on ordinary people is often lost in statistics found in history books. The people get lost in the numbers. And I am challenged by writing about people caught in extraordinary times. I write what is known as ‚Äúcommercial fiction‚Äù so I have to walk a fine line between giving a sense of the human experience in a troubling situation, yet at the same time being respectful of the fact that any storyteller is effectively in the entertainment business. That might upset writers who do not view themselves through such a lens, but that's the bottom line. Yes, we touch upon the human condition in all sorts of situations, and we can lead our readers to universal truths ‚Äì I have always said that writers can touch ‚Äútruth‚Äù more readily with fiction than we can with fact ‚Äì but even though we take a reader along a winding path of many emotions, at the end of the journey it‚Äôs best if hope prevails. So where am I going with today‚Äôs post? Back to war. In 1989 when the Berlin wall was torn down, I remember a correspondent who had reported on a number of human disasters, commenting, ‚ÄúPeace has broken out all over the world.‚Äù If only. Over the past couple of years, it seemed as if conflict was breaking out everywhere, and now this ‚Äì the utter tragedy in Israel and Gaza. I‚Äôm not going to get into who did this and who did that, though I remember Mum watching a TV report on a war and saying, ‚ÄúThey should put these so-called leaders in a field and let them fight it out ‚Äì leave the people out of it.‚Äù I tend to agree, because the majority of people just want to get on with trying to forge a good life, or at least a bearable existence. And they trust their elected leaders to protect every single hoped-for good day. People want to look back at a well-lived life. Since childhood, in my amateurish way I‚Äôve immersed myself in trying to understand the causes of war and the human cost of conflict. I know this much: follow the money. Follow the power hungry. Put those afraid of losing power under the microscope. They are often connected, threaded together across the globe, a self-obsessed daisy chain of snake charmers. Every move is calculated because it is in their interests to have conflict in other regions of the world, if not their own. War in one geopolitical location has the potential to enhance the prospects of a leader in a country far removed from the terror. And then follow the money. Who loses money in a time of peace? You can even whittle it down to conflict within a country, a city or a village. Who wants to retain power, who wants to be right, and who wants to make money? I could give solid examples for each of those comments, but that does not serve what I want to say ‚Äì which is this: The ordinary people pay. Whether in uniform, bombed out of their homes or shot down in the streets and in their kitchens, the people pay the price in blood, in terror, grief, pain and the dying promise of tomorrow; a future lost because the lifeblood of their hopes and dreams is flowing away. I am inspired to write these thoughts having seen photos of a journalist and his cameraman in Gaza who broke down while reporting on the terrors people are suffering, just as a woman doing the same job in Israel broke down and wept two days ago. No one wins. This morning these are the words echoing in my mind: ‚ÄúO what made fatuous sunbeams toil To break earth's sleep at all?‚Äù From the poem ‚ÄúFutility‚Äù written by Wilfred Owen. Owen was killed on the Western Front just days before the Armistice declaring an end to the Great War in 1918. To lift you up when so much pain and suffering is weighing down the world, I think our greatest task is encapsulated in the prayer of St. Francis. I don't care which god or goddess a person prays to, or if they pray at all ‚Äì that's their business and it‚Äôs personal. But I love these words: ‚ÄúWhere there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy.‚Äù When I first heard those words, I thought I should take them as my marching orders for life.

facebook,"Israel‚Äôs military told some 1 million Palestinians on Friday to evacuate northern Gaza and head to the southern part of the besieged territory, an unprecedented order applying to almost half the population ahead of an expected ground invasion against the ruling Hamas militant group. The UN warned that so many people fleeing en masse ‚Äî with just a 24-hour deadline ‚Äî would be calamitous. Hamas, which staged a shocking and brutal attack on Israel nearly a week ago and has fired thousands of rockets since, dismissed it as a ploy and called on people to stay in their homes. The evacuation order, which includes Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, sparked widespread panic among civilians and aid workers already running from Israeli airstrikes and contending with a total siege and a territory-wide blackout. ‚ÄúForget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you‚Äôll make it, if you‚Äôre going to live,‚Äù said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, as she broke into heaving sobs. The war has already claimed over 2,800 lives on both sides and sent tensions soaring across the region. Israel has traded fire in recent days with Lebanon‚Äôs Hezbollah militant group, sparking fears of an ever wider conflict, though that frontier is currently calm. | via Associated Press",,696,"{'like_count': 177, 'comment_count': 91, 'num_users': 8782726}",Philippine Star,,2023-10-13 11:25:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/341858556_918415572727450_374717831366242673_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CecJtIgqe6QAX9kyAEL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDQlbN_xjai8pwVgUMXBU-S86hAA8foALC9kDrR1e8QGA&oe=655AF380,https://www.facebook.com/100064616655120/posts/719065810257301,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391544625_719065736923975_5430836068643634899_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=n4AyJUxVEKkAX_m2jfX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCa5pna-eE83sz1ghGODsmdmcUHBepQ762wS_347NcxhA&oe=6533C7A3

facebook,"FIB COMMANDER BRIGADIER ALFRED MATAMBO VISITS KENYA QUICK REACTION FORCE SERVING UNDER MONUSCO IN BENI DRC In a gesture of solidarity and support, the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) Commander, Brigadier Alfred Matambo, paid a significant visit to the Kenyan Quick Reaction Force (QRF) deployed under the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) in Beni. This visit underscores the critical role played by international peacekeepers in promoting stability and security in the troubled region. The Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly the volatile eastern provinces, has been plagued by a long-standing conflict, characterized by militia activities, inter-ethnic violence, and the illicit exploitation of natural resources. The FIB, consisting of troops from various contributing countries, has been a crucial element of MONUSCO's efforts to restore peace and security in this tumultuous region. Brigadier Matambo, a seasoned military strategist and leader, arrived in Kenya QRF Base in Beni to assess the operational readiness and morale of the troops, which has been at the forefront of MONUSCO's efforts in countering armed groups and providing humanitarian assistance to the affected population. During his visit, he commended the Kenyan troops for their dedication and unwavering commitment to the mission's objectives. In a meeting with Kenyan QRF commanders, Brigadier Matambo emphasized the importance of coordinated efforts among MONUSCO forces and the need for adaptability in the face of evolving security challenges. He stated, ""Our mission is not only to protect the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo but also to help create conditions for lasting peace. Your role here is crucial, and your sacrifices are not unnoticed."" The Kenyan QRF, known for their rapid response capabilities, has been instrumental in thwarting attacks, protecting civilians, and providing critical medical aid to the wounded. They have also been involved in community engagement initiatives aimed at fostering trust and cooperation with local communities, a pivotal aspect of peacekeeping in conflict zones. Brigadier Matambo's visit serves as a testament to the international community's commitment to the peace and stability of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The FIB's presence, along with dedicated troop contributions from nations like Kenya, plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the region and creating an environment conducive to the political and socio-economic development that the Congolese people so desperately need. As Brigadier Matambo concludes his visit to Beni, he reaffirms the FIB's unwavering commitment to its mission and expresses gratitude to all peacekeepers, including the Kenyan QRF, for their dedication and sacrifices in pursuit of a peaceful and prosperous Democratic Republic of Congo. The international community continues to stand united in its quest to bring an end to the suffering of the Congolese people and pave the way for a brighter future in the region. https://bit.ly/3RW0atM:=:https://mod.go.ke/news/fib-commander-brigadier-alfred-matambo-visits-kenya-quick-reaction-force-serving-under-monusco-in-beni-drc-2/",,631,"{'like_count': 606, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 299429}",Kenya Defence Forces,,2023-10-13 12:55:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/271740993_274242824802317_2680389875611401031_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=iXHWmpXIZ64AX-pL7-6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCTCgECR_MiyuDK-Y0czPmkjAgJFsOAoV31-vn_i76vOw&oe=655A706D,https://www.facebook.com/100066498046550/posts/685639933662602,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391703863_685639970329265_6886161063592863542_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=BOnvR8_xeusAX8wOE8f&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAm04ZkQY4TNujN9nJGUwo6s89y3BB0IKrkTQvVC52t6A&oe=65390799

facebook,"NSCDC BOSS LAUNCHES 12 SECURITY BOOKS, CALLS FOR INSTITUTIONALISATION OF SECURITY THREAT PROGRAMMES. The Minister of Interior, Dr Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, says that the role of research in the enhancement of internal security can not be over emphasised. The Minister said this during the launch of 12 security books co-authored by the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ahmed Abubakar Audi, PhD, mni, OFR and the Academy President of International Academy for Gender and Peace, Prof Tyoor Therhemba on at the Corps National Headquarters, Abuja. He said that it was important for security personnel to be properly trained based on research peculiar to time and security threats. ‚ÄúThe battle is more ideological than physical, superior knowledge makes it ideological which comes from a place of learning. ‚ÄúThe bad guys should be running to catch up with the pace of the state and we can only achieve this in the era of intellectualism,‚Äù he said. He further said that he will ensure all agencies under the Ministry, established a functional library to foster educational growth and service delivery. Tunji-Ojo said that the Ministry will set up a team of professionals to provide technical advisory services. He said that the team, tagged Paramilitary Brain Trust (PBT), will consist of intellectuals such as retired senior officers and professors and will be given research topics to tackle depending on peculiar security situations. While addressing personnel, he said that the era of promotion just by writing exams might be over soon. He said that promotion of officers and men of paramilitary agencies will be as a result of evaluation parameters. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be a CG to be celebrated, in your private corner, give and do your best and know that one day that little effort of yours might be what is needed to turn this country around. ‚ÄúAbility to cast problems and preorder solutions is what leadership is about,‚Äù he said. The Minister expressed satisfaction at the level of performance and capacity of the NSCDC boss, adding that the ability to turn threats to opportunities is what distinguishes successful people from others as displayed by Audi. ‚ÄúI assure you that NSCDC is doing well, we can do better and will do better as there are lots of reforms we are working on,‚Äù the Minister said. The National Security Adviser (NSA), Mallam Nuhu Ribadu in his keynote address congratulated the CG for the efforts put into the books towards solving our security threats. The NSA, represented by Major General AG Laka, called for improved synergy among all the security organisations. He assured the populace that a safe and peaceful Nigeria is sacrosant and non-negotiable, hence, all hands must be on deck to respond to emerging security threats, Dr Audi earlier in his remarks, said that Nigeria‚Äôs struggle for independence, post colonialism, slavery, Cold War amongst other situations had affected Nigerias security landscape in a peculiar way, leading to emerging security threats such as terrorism, cyber crimes. ‚ÄúAlongside organised trans-border crimes which have over time intertwined and confounded the nation‚Äôs security situation. According to him, to tackle Nigerias security threats, adequate research and institutionalisation of programmes that aim to provide solutions to these threats must be priotised. Audi said that one of the researches carried out revealed that no kidnap occurred without the involvement of an insider, hence the need for more of such researches. He enjoined citizens to reflect on what they can do for the country and not just what the country can do for its citizens. The NSCDC boss however frowned at the absence of indigenous instructional materials to adequately guide security studies in line with peculiar security threats faced by Nigeria. He said that the books were aimed at promoting national security, identitying security bridges, proffer recommendations, contribute to policy, studies and knowledge of security. ‚ÄúThe 12 books are titled; Civil Defence and Military under the Geneva Conventions, Critical Dictates of International Humanitarian Law and the Development of the Civil Defence, Readings on Nigeria‚Äôs National Security. ‚ÄúPeace, Conflict and Human Security in Africa, International Cooperation Against Trafficking in Persons, Terrorism and Threat to Food Security in Lake Chad Region, amongst other publications,‚Äù Audi listed.

facebook,"15 lessons from the book ""The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups"" by Daniel Coyle: 1. Purpose is the foundation of a strong culture. Groups with a clear and shared purpose are more likely to be successful than groups without one. 2. Psychological safety is essential for collaboration and learning. People need to feel safe to take risks, share ideas, and admit mistakes in order to learn and grow. 3. Shared rituals help to build trust and cohesion. Groups that have shared rituals, such as team celebrations or regular meetings, are more likely to be successful. 4. Communication is key to success. Groups need to be able to communicate effectively both internally and externally. 5. Feedback is essential for learning and improvement. Groups need to be able to give and receive feedback constructively. 6. Conflict is not always a bad thing. Groups can benefit from healthy conflict, which can lead to new ideas and solutions. 7. Diversity is a strength. Groups that are diverse in terms of their members' backgrounds, perspectives, and skills are more likely to be successful. 8. Inclusion is essential for a strong culture. All members of a group need to feel valued and respected. 9. Leadership is important, but it is not the only thing that matters. Groups need strong leaders, but they also need collective intelligence and collaboration. 10. Culture is not static. It is constantly evolving, and leaders need to be able to adapt to change. 11. Build safety. This means creating an environment where people feel safe to take risks, share ideas, and admit mistakes. 12. Share vulnerability. This means being willing to be open and honest with each other, even about our weaknesses. 13. Establish purpose. This means having a clear and shared goal that everyone is working towards. 14. Create a culture of learning. This means encouraging people to ask questions, share ideas, and learn from each other. 15. Celebrate success. I hope these lessons are helpful!

facebook,"Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has criticized European nations for being too accepting of mass immigration of people of different cultures. Specifically, cultures that now openly cheer on the Hamas attack against Israel. He also warned that soon, European people may find themselves under attack. In an interview with Mathias Dopfner, the CEO of German media group Axel Springer, Kissinger said it was ‚Äòpainful‚Äô seeing Arabs celebrating the death of Jews in the streets of Berlin. ‚ÄòIt was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different cultural and religious concepts because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that,‚Äô he said. Kissinger, who himself fled persecution for being Jewish, also called for ‚Äòunconditional‚Äô support for Israel, and that there should be a ‚Äòpenalty‚Äô placed on Hamas. However, he warned of the dangers of escalating the situation stating, ‚Äòthe Middle East conflict has the danger of escalating and bringing in other Arab countries under the pressure of their public opinion.‚Äô He also noted that, thanks to mass migration, Europe may find itself part of this conflict whether it likes it or not. ‚ÄòEvery European nation has the same interest because the same attitude might erupt in the direction of Europe,‚Äô he concluded.",,601,"{'like_count': 270, 'comment_count': 157, 'num_users': 7378058}",RT,,2023-10-13 17:15:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352498807_1222459251803772_2416076672665411094_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ocHJuvLlBtUAX-zHcHI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCTir_xmbmBRF-Dig8Wqy-AQ6k4coUBE_vOltKsM4QHWg&oe=655AF0C6,https://www.facebook.com/100064566078787/posts/726927932802736,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387872171_726926029469593_3739442780962299732_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ng02jK8s2TEAX8Z6_2_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAiF2QiB9AXYGG9qdcT9yi29awKXfmLDtJ88HHJa1o3JQ&oe=65335638

facebook,"ISH News told you about the Israel and Palestine‚Äôs Hamas group‚Äôs conflict. Here are some updates. In our previous news we told you that the Hamas group has taken several people hostage. People who are killed or taken hostage are not only Israeli nationals but also nationals of other countries. Several countries have announced that their nationals have either been killed, taken hostage or are missing. Thailand said that 18 of its nationals are dead and 11 are missing. The USA said that 22 of its citizens are dead and several others are missing. 10 Nepali nationals have died. Several Germans have been taken hostage. Many people from the Philippines, Austria, Sri Lanka and several other countries are missing. Hamas had warned Israel that if their sites are attacked any further, they will start killing the hostages. However, Hamas has now released a video appearing to show the release of a female captive and two children. Israel has added more flights to help bring home more military about 3,00,000 reserve force members to help its retaliation against the Hamas strikes. A 92 year old army veteran has joined back the Israeli force to fight against Hamas. Hacktivist Groups (hackers groups) are hacking Israeli websites online amid the war, disrupting and defacing websites like the Jerusalem Post. These hackers piggyback on the fighting, either to support their favored side or simply get attention. Already over 3000 people including hundreds of children have died on both sides. Kfar Aza means a Gaza village. It was a small Israeli village kibbutz (community) near the Gaza border. It was a prosperous place with a school, a synagogue and a population of more than 700. Israeli officials and reporters at the scene were left in shock as Hamas terrorists brutally killed at least 40 babies and young children, with some of them being decapitated (beheaded). General Itai Veruv from the Israeli army said, ""Mothers, fathers, babies, young families killed in their beds, in the protection room, in the dining room, in their garden. It's not a war, it's not a battlefield. It's a massacre.‚Äù Basic principle of International humanitarian law is that at times of conflict or war, every effort should be made to spare the young. However, for decades, neither Israel nor Hamas has abided by law. The law states that the opposing sides should provide children with ‚Äúthe care and aid they require‚Äù. But neither Israel nor Palestine does that. International Law doesn‚Äôt allow abduction of children by the enemies. However, during the recent attack, it is reported that Hamas has taken several Israeli children hostage and transported into the Gaza Strip alone or with their parents. Israel too earlier had abducted Palestinian children. So both do not follow any of the international laws related to children. In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised: ‚ÄúEvery member of Hamas is a dead man. Hamas is Daesh [ISIS] and we will crush them and destroy them as the world has destroyed Daesh.‚Äù Defence Minister Yoav Gallant added, ‚ÄúWe will wipe Hamas off the face of the Earth.‚Äù Israel has announced an emergency wartime government. The Israeli Prime Minister joined hands with a top political rival to create a wartime Cabinet to oversee the fight to avenge the gruesome attack by Hamas militants. Israel carried out heavy bombardments across the Gaza Strip for the fifth day as more Palestinians lost electricity after Israel put the territory under full siege, barring the entry of fuel, food, water, medicine and more into the territory. Gaza‚Äôs biggest hospital has fuel left only for a couple of days. All of the Gaza Strip's borders are closed, leaving Palestinian civilians with nowhere to escape or seek safety. Like how India has RAW, similarly Israel‚Äôs intelligence agency is called Mossad. It is extremely strong and it is difficult to believe that Mossad failed to stop the attack. However there are contradictory views by experts - One of the views is that It's impossible Mossad failed to stop the attack. Israel just let it happen. Mossad knew what was going to happen but let Hamas make a mistake so that Israel could launch a ferocious attack on it. Mossad was not so ignorant that it did not know about this attack. Israel wanted to invade Palestine, but they had no excuse, Hamas gave them the reason. The other view is that Hamas conducted a years-long campaign to fool Israel into thinking the group did not desire armed conflict and could be pacified with economic incentives to maintain calm. Sources said that as part of its preparations, Hamas had built a mock Israeli community to train for the assault. Israel surely saw them but they were convinced that Hamas wasn‚Äôt keen on getting into a confrontation.

With the reported call from former hamas leader Khaled Meshaal for a ""Global Day of Jihad"", many have expressed concern.

Let's not let the actions of a few overshadow the efforts of those who stand ready to keep us safe. There have been no reported threats directed towards our community. As a precaution, I have directed my deputies to be vigilant during their performance of duties and know that I have every confidence in their abilities to respond to any given situation we may face now and in the future.

The initiative's essence was to involve young people in searching for a solution with a new mentality and from various angles, with the participation of several distinguished young people from various academic backgrounds, and to direct their efforts and ideas towards searching for ways to contribute to achieving peace and preparing research in various disciplines based on realistic experiences and tangible effects. I am pleased with this effort because it not only presented potential solutions, but also inspired young leaders to play a role in improving our world by engaging them in issues of justice, conflict resolution, and peace promotion. This project did, in fact, yield useful recommendations. Redefining the conflict, supporting Palestinian rights, proposing a two-state solution, promoting cultural interaction, and revising school curricula to address historical trauma are among them. We are still making every effort to bring opposing opinions closer together, to propose peaceful solutions, and to strive for peace and justice in our region and around the world...hopefully in the near future.",,515,"{'like_count': 353, 'comment_count': 109, 'num_users': 281874}",Khalaf Al Habtoor,,2023-10-13 04:58:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/346870276_200583835709290_5634896195933969197_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hKU4bh0ZvJUAX9qJZa6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD5p3ZoKrk_QNxEDvERYqsmR3cBVSALUOAN46axb3udoQ&oe=655A346F,https://www.facebook.com/100057595983581/posts/772621244667735,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387874228_772619018001291_2414689948980226149_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=R2Z0PNug0oQAX8-Fh_6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDDbPHcI2fXNKJOa2lN1FACgKrqNjnoJql5Ap4GJxT0hA&oe=655AFBF2

facebook,"12 REASONS TO FORGIVE YOUR SPOUSE...üôè 1. Your spouse has apologized. As long as your spouse admits the wrong he/she has done, find it in you to forgive. 2. You too need forgiving. Maybe you have wronged or you will wrong your spouse differently, you are not perfect. It is not about who is more wrong. 3. To build your marriage. You cannot build your marriage to a better future, if you are holding on to past offense. 4. Your spouse will sometimes offend you unwillingly. Because you two are so intertwined, your spouse will sometimes wrong you without wanting to. 5. You forgive others. Don't be so easy to forgive your parents, siblings, friends, children; but the one person you refuse to forgive is your spouse. 6. To address the matter. Forgiving each other lays the right calm and conducive environment for you two to talk about issues and iron things out. It is easier to solve conflict with a diplomatic spouse. 7. To excercise the muscle of apology and forgiveness in your marriage. The more you two learn to apologize and forgive; the better you two become at it and your marriage will be healthier and not distracted by issues. 8. To teach your spouse the value of an apology. When you show your spouse that admiting wrong and working on the issue is a mature and rewarding option, you encourage your spouse to not be driven by ego and tough stance, but to choose the path of owning up and dealing with matters. 9. Because God has forgiven you. We forgive because we have been forgiven. 10. So that we don't lose a good thing. It is not easy to find love. Don't through it all away, ruining what you two have built for years because of a down moment. 11. To love each other deeper. If you are with a mature spouse who truly loves you, he/she will love you even more when you show forgiveness. What a joy to have a spouse who covers your nakedness. 12. To conquer. Couples that have overcome an offense that threatened to tear them apart, many years down the line often look back and say ""Wow! Look how far our love has come and how much our love has withstood. You are still the one I love""",,509,"{'like_count': 301, 'comment_count': 49, 'num_users': 507915}",Thoughts of Jacktone,,2023-10-13 04:33:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/338001205_1368720427298146_7411246640499111275_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Y2RUnb3oDQYAX-HSA0u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBqyqTelr8rLeEt81yumQygWi0FvjjsEBUdmYP8UoZ7VA&oe=655B2E12,https://www.facebook.com/100064148888578/posts/720897836725173,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391592762_720897756725181_2556835352099996986_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=6ohi3A5a9I8AX9eANL9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCiFPIW8TdNnU-n2S-_hxdbB9p9GDDYbuiyxxBywAKcQA&oe=652E7E58

facebook,"Wanna know... the relationship of Kayi's(Ottomans) and Kinik's (Seljukes). Then give this a read and you won't regret. Note: these historic things have conflicts as only Holy Quran is a perfect book in this world. Word to word correct without any doubt. Things mentioned is not a selfmade or a lie. Its up to u wheather you wanna believe it or not‚ò∫ So we have seen about them in the series Dirilis Ertughul and Kurlus Osman. Other then tht their relation is way older. Now where the respect element came from in both Ertughul Bey and Osman Bey for Seljuke state. Oghuz Khan(RA) when became young got married to two , Uzoklar and Bozuklar(2nd wife). It is said he felt in love with both of them one after the other. Kayi and Kinik both were grandsons of Oghuz Khan, Kayi khan belonged to Bozuklar, whereas, kinik belong to Uzokler. Oghuz khan had altogether 24 grandsons each had their own tribe,they were known as Oghuzlar. Tughrul Bey of Kayi tribe at a very young age worked for Sultan Tughrul Beg of Seljuke Dynasty, he was given different tasks by Sultan Tughrul, among them was appointment as ammbassador in Abbasi Caliphate, Sultan Tughrul was highly impressed by his Tughrul Bey's job and gave a place near Merv, a small place known as Mahan under his govership, Kayi tribe of Tughrul Bey shifted to tht place. Actually Ertughul bey belonged to his lineage, like he was forefather of Ertughul/Osman Bey. After his death in Mahan, his son Temur served Seljuke state and worked as a ambassador in khwarzamshahi state , in his last days he returned to Mahan and died there. Later on his son,Kezel Buga was alo attached to Seljuke state and was given Merv under his governorship by Seljuke Sultan, he was grand father of Suleiman shah/Gunduz Alp. There is a conflict on who was father of Ertughul Bey. There is a very famous historic event.. its quiet long though.. but it was not shown in Dirilis Ertughul probably due to low budget. Kayi tribe under the leadership of Ertughul was on its way to find a place to settle.. but during there journey they stopped to take some rest.. there they found out a war is going on and they helped Seljuke Sultan Allauddin to win war against (conflict wheather they were Mongols or Byzantines). Seljukes were loosing badly but the moment Ertughul Bey along with his Alps jumped into the battlefield it changed the victory in favor of Muslims/Seljukes.

facebook,"I understand that there may be curiosity surrounding the superstitions associated with Friday the 13th, but I assure you that today is actually a day filled with positive energy and good fortune. While it is true that parts of the world will witness a solar eclipse known as the ‚Äòring of fire on Saturday, October 14th, it is important to note that this day itself is not inherently negative. However, via visions, the days following the eclipse we will see an increase in social unrest and uprisings around the globe. After the solar eclipse, it would be wise to keep an eye out for a few potential occurrences: 1. Widespread protest. 2. Social movements by groups of people to bring about social and political change. These movements will challenge existing power structures and cause large scale demonstrations and boycotts. 3. Terr0r cells or sleeper cells will ‚Äòbl0w up‚Äô places where there are lots of people, including the western world. 4. Devastating wildfires. 5. A lot more unusual disasters such as hurricanes, volcano eruptions and mega earthquakes. 6. Cyber attacks will continue to occur. In terms of T & T, the crime rate, which is currently low, will significantly increase starting from November 2023. This surge in crime is expected to result in numerous casualties, with a particular government official becoming a primary target. It is crucial to remember not to make promises and subsequently break them, especially when dealing with criminals. Additionally, police stations and other important government facilities will also become targets. The recent rise in b0mb scares around schools and hospitals should not be disregarded as mere pranks, as they may eventually materialize into real threats. When the minister of national security issues an apology <in his made up British accent> to the nation, it is not merely an act of goodwill. Rather, it serves as a warning to citizens that dangerous criminals will soon target almost everyone, leaving individuals feeling helpless and abandoned, akin to being stranded in a scorching desert without water. Crime and criminal activities will continue to persist and escalate until the United Nations forces assume control over this nation. There is no need to wonder about the start of World War III, as this world has always been engaged in a constant battle, given that many individuals possess a mentality inclined towards conflict. War in the mind means war in the world!",,475,"{'like_count': 308, 'comment_count': 81, 'num_users': 52179}",Sister Devi - Medical Visionary/Psychic,,2023-10-13 11:04:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/137218204_243985707098739_4328686810591685569_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=chmchq22c4kAX9is686&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA-ZGPGLfoYFfJezb3V2Hw1UUZGMRFe68i-M_STS2mDcw&oe=657D267B,https://www.facebook.com/100044619330798/posts/882067476623889,

This year marks the 106TH Anniversary of the Miracle of the Sun, promised by the Blessed Mother, that over 70,000 witnessed. This included atheists, socialists, representatives of the Portuguese media, as well as others who despised the Catholic Church. The sun actually appeared to be dancing, twirling in the sky. Then it seemed to hurdle towards the earth, terrifying people. It had rained heavily before Our Lady‚Äôs apparition. The roads were muddy; the grounds were drenched. After the miracle of the sun stopped, the clothes of those who were there dried instantly. The muddy ground quickly hardened and became dry, as if it had not rained in weeks. The miracle of the sun proved that the Marian apparitions were real and God is still relevant in the world. The message of Our Lady at Fatima is prayer and reparation. Our Lady had said that the world had turned against her Son, the world had been distracted, the world was on a wrong course. She was calling the faithful to come back and make reparation, to make sacrifices, do penances and pray the Holy Rosary. Our Mother came to Fatima to implore us to pray the Rosary, wear the Scapular, make the Five First Saturdays. Consequently, it wasn‚Äôt heeded and we still see a lot of evil in the world, even after the Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary that was led by Pope Francis in 2021. Have you been praying the Holy Rosary daily for: ~ peace, to stop the killings, violence and unrest in the world ~ the conversion of sinners Please add these intentions, which are critical now: ~ the traditional family and the protection of children ~ all those who are participating in the Synod at the Vatican this month ~ for peace in Israel and peace in Palestine, as Pope Francis has called for an end to the conflict. We have to pray with conviction and faith that when we say those Hail Mary‚Äôs to the Blessed Mother that God is going to intervene. Never become discouraged. There‚Äôs never anything that is too big, too overwhelming ‚Äì a situation in your family, with your loved one, that is too critical, that the Blessed Mother cannot help. We all have those situations and must have the same confidence when we pray. That is why Our Lady of Fatima is so relevant today. Our Lady came to Fatima to ask us to change our lives. We can begin again! üôèüìøüåπ",,456,"{'like_count': 211, 'comment_count': 113, 'num_users': 16912}",Long Tower,,2023-10-13 07:16:58,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/346086030_614616370718953_2503370479213802651_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=GX-qBFs1VR4AX9w08sl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAPFJ92NqQWdeL_bMrndftzu8MTXbSJGY6DwR7Xb7rtmA&oe=655AB87D,https://www.facebook.com/100064323174295/posts/731568642330568,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391714729_731569042330528_2519768363139590898_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=3qjbFEak10EAX_qZQY7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD6LG45KLGbwDlBSh4eBfNifL28Hyjv2fxxnC3qwWUnnA&oe=6545F776
facebook,"This is one of the greatest lessons we can ever learn. We will all experience pain, sometimes traumatic and life changing pain. That pain will impact our life and mold us but the choice is ours as to HOW it will affect us. Even if the pain feels like it will break you, you can decide how you're going to pick up those pieces and put yourself back together. What is this pain teaching you about what you believe about yourself? It is telling you what still needs to heal inside of you and where you need to make changes in your life. Listen to it, feel it and grow from it. Push through that pain to open your heart even more, not to feel more pain, but to defy the cruelty in the world that is trying to replace your love with fear; to not let it break you or change you and to realize how strong you really are so that you can know how much love you are capable of. If we don't, then that pain will become like an illness inside us that will spread to the ones we love, causing them pain, making them suffer and creating a cycle or pattern of pain in their lives too. Pain and conflict comes from inner conflict; what you are agreeing to or believe about yourself in this moment! When you stop agreeing with the story that isn't true about yourself, then you are free to feel the way that you want to feel and live your actual truth: that you are deserving of love. Use your pain to make you grow and evolve to be the best you you've ever been. Transform your pain into love and be a source of healing to yourself and others. -Joel Clemons ‚Ä¢ Love, Life & Relationship Coach @the.gentleman.wolf (I can help you learn how to transform your pain.

facebook,"The use of a ""disappearing map of Israel/Palestine"" can contribute to the understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from different perspectives in several ways: 1. Historical Context: The map provides a visual representation of the changes in territory and borders over time. It helps people understand the historical context of the conflict, including the establishment of Israel in 1948 and subsequent conflicts, and how these events have shaped the current situation. 2. Palestinian Perspective: From the Palestinian perspective, the map underscores their narrative of loss and displacement. It highlights the impact of Israeli settlements, barriers, and occupation on Palestinian land and their ability to establish a sovereign state. It serves as a symbol of their struggle for self-determination and the need to address their grievances. 3. Israeli Perspective: From an Israeli perspective, the map may be seen as oversimplifying or distorting the historical events that led to the creation of Israel. It can lead to a better understanding of their arguments about Israel's legitimacy and its right to exist within recognized borders for security reasons. 4. Negotiation and Resolution: The use of the disappearing map can also emphasize the need for negotiations and a two-state solution. It can highlight the importance of addressing territorial disputes and finding a mutually acceptable resolution that respects the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. While the map serves as a powerful symbolic tool, it is crucial to approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with an open mind and consider multiple perspectives to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues involved.",,453,"{'like_count': 194, 'comment_count': 126, 'num_users': 336911}",Conscious Lee,,2023-10-13 13:54:37,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/320765454_721161212702424_731028478629252023_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=eB-Tb3tmhRUAX-bx7tW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAr_m3_sUGycG_MFgaXssJs1YvE9i6S62HDHxnpTZvjRQ&oe=655A1658,https://www.facebook.com/100063746558947/posts/827072909427587,

The Embassy received this information from Interpol Jerusalem at about 2200H Israel Time of 12 October 2023. The fatality is a 49-year-old female caregiver from Negros Occidental. The Embassy is gathering details on the circumstances of her death. Ambassador Pedro ""Junie"" Laylo, Jr. has reached out to her next of kin who are in Kuwait to convey his condolences and offer assistance to their family. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., will also call the next of kin to personally express his sympathies. For reasons of privacy, the Embassy again deems it prudent to withhold the identity of the victim unless the next of kin gives it consent. This reduces to three (3) the number of Filipino nationals who have remained missing since the 07 October attack while three (3) have been confirmed dead. 26 were earlier found or rescued, with one (1) still recovering from moderate injuries in a hospital. #PHinIsrael üáµüá≠ü§ùüáÆüá±",,438,"{'like_count': 91, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 76908}",Philippine Embassy in Israel,,2023-10-13 12:37:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/341853427_177138248588040_2499515308121705499_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fcIp179nCIcAX9akTez&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAW_ZSrrs0HiUvIDHjy3tXOXYge0OtorMSpyohf61grrg&oe=655B0290,https://www.facebook.com/100064870143169/posts/717394843766181,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387832031_717394517099547_4377741206152582256_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rOZGQC9AjaEAX8Hvi6z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAzoSG3hSb46FAQXQHgHT-bt9bCXyg0LGcMtpi9Fn606w&oe=65418480

facebook,"Dehumanization is the negating of a person‚Äôs individual humanity and the cruelty that accompanies it. It is a psychological process of demonizing people, seeing them as less than human not worthy of humane treatment. This method reverses our instincts: harming others goes against our soul-level inclinations as there are very deep inhibitions that prevent us from treating others like sub-human; dehumanization is aimed at subverting those inhibitions. Throughout history, this technique has been deliberately exploited by structures of darkness to distract, sow division, push concealed agendas, increase power and justify acts of violence, slavery, and the violation of basic human rights. When successful, it creates moral exclusion of groups that are targeted based on their identity-e.g., religious beliefs, nationality, gender, race, ethnicity, medical status-and depicted as ‚Äúless than‚Äù, criminal or even evil. The ‚Äúothering‚Äù scheme always starts an ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù dynamic, where innocent people become pawns and victims. As we take sides, lose trust, and get angrier, we not only solidify an idea of other as separate, but also start to lose our ability to listen, communicate, and even practice the slightest of empathy. Language and imagery are crucial for achieving the dehumanizing goal. Once we see people ‚Äúon the other side‚Äù as morally inferior and even dangerous, the conflict is then framed as good vs evil. When this framework has been established, positions become more rigid as we are lead to believe that we must destroy ‚Äúothers‚Äù or be destroyed ourselves. The dehumanizing aim has then been achieved. Now more than ever we need to acknowledge that we‚Äôre all vulnerable to the slow, insidious and manipulative psychological weapon of dehumanization. Only by acknowledging this and searching for compassion and healing within our hearts we can avoid falling into this trap and prevent history from repeating itself in a never ending cycle of darkness. Don‚Äôt stand for division, stand for peace. Division destroys everything in its path, instead stand for love, which when it is true and powerful is unbeatable. Questions? Feedback?

facebook,"Students be snitchin' on each other during group projects. They send complaints to their professors: ""Dear Dr. P, a team member, So-and-So, hasn't fulfilled their responsibilities. I've reached out to them like 11teen times and they haven't answered. I don't want my grade to suffer. What should I do?"" I ignore these messages and choose not to intervene, and guess what? They almost always end up working it out on their own. Ignoring these messages might seem counterintuitive, but it aligns with promoting accountability and fostering conflict resolution skills among students. Ignoring these emails pushes students to address conflicts amongst themselves. It prompts them to communicate, negotiate, and find solutions independently, skills that are vital in professional settings. In the professional world, individuals are expected to manage team conflicts and disagreements collaboratively. By not intervening, students get a taste of what it's like to resolve issues autonomously, mirroring the expectations of the workplace. When one person does not come through, it impacts the entire group, and I want students to grasp this reality and understand the interconnectedness and interdependence of a group. We rise and fall together. While some argue that it's unfair to hold the entire group accountable for one person's shortcomings, I firmly believe it mirrors the realities of the professional world. In most workplaces, a team's success is a collective effort, and individual actions can impact the entire group and the company's bottom line. Learning this lesson in an academic setting prepares students for the collaborative and interdependent nature of many careers. At the end of the day, as their very busy editor, I don't have to manage those conflicts, nor do I care about the behind-the-scenes drama.

facebook,"Int‚Äôl Women Conference 2023 With Rev. Mrs Karen Nubidga #Day1Evening Pictorial Highlights Special Ministration Guest Speaker : Pastor Zemenjuoh Franka Topic: Women where are Your Accuser's? 1. Where are your accusers? This phrase is reminiscent of the biblical story in John 8:1-11, where Jesus encountered a woman caught in adultery and asked those who accused her to examine their own actions and conscience before passing judgment on her. The message behind this phrase is to encourage self-reflection and humility before judging others. 2. A woman as a seed carrier and finisher: This phrase seems to highlight the role of women in bearing and nurturing life, both physically and metaphorically. It recognizes their capacity to bring forth new ideas, projects, and relationships and to see them through to completion. 3. Silence as a weapon: Exodus 14:4 refers to a situation where the Israelites, pursued by the Egyptian army, were trapped at the Red Sea. God instructed Moses to remain silent and let Him fight on their behalf. The concept of silence as a weapon suggests that sometimes it is more effective to refrain from engaging in conflict or responding to provocation, trusting in a higher power to intervene or resolve the situation. 4. Your pain and weakness turning into a message: This phrase suggests that the challenges and struggles one experiences can ultimately become a source of strength and inspiration for others. It implies that through overcoming personal difficulties, one can share their story and provide hope and encouragement to others facing similar circumstances. 5. Waiting as a stage of punishment: This statement questions the perception that waiting for something, such as a desired outcome or a life partner, should not be seen as a form of punishment. Instead, it encourages a shift in perspective to view waiting as a period of growth, self-discovery, and preparation for what is to come. 6.Fulfillment in life is not solely determined by one's marital status. It implies that regardless of whether one is single or married, true fulfillment comes from personal growth, pursuing passions, cultivating meaningful relationships, and finding purpose and contentment within oneself. 7. Are you ready for marriage? Wanting a perfect gentleman and being perfect yourself: This question prompts self-reflection and challenges the notion of seeking perfection in a partner or oneself. It suggests that rather than focusing on finding someone perfect, it is important to consider personal readiness for a committed relationship and to cultivate qualities like kindness, understanding, and compromise within oneself. #InternationalWomenConference2023 #Day1Evening #TransfigurationTV #RevKarenNubidga #AGMHQ",,402,"{'like_count': 314, 'comment_count': 35, 'num_users': 54512}",Prophet Kevin OnLine,,2023-10-13 11:52:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/323397332_1368908690540230_2325597960534677271_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=9Pce4ajnnpMAX9rd688&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB4C9W8OMo2PFLRruKAH0l-dIk0zz2vatf7-jmVSj0ihg&oe=655A5714,https://www.facebook.com/100045228243376/posts/871659144351686,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391755349_871655641018703_4259884909278613012_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=LjGTwEbntpwAX8WuzcJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAvsoIy5I0stqKDPvQ5WjkfMnCqd_Gl8l8swH1FVCLGhA&oe=653E7F32

facebook,"An update on the parishioners and priests on pilgrimage in the Holy Land... A group of 32 people from the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Archdiocese of Omaha and the Diocese of Des Moines are on pilgrimage in the Holy Land and working to return to the United States following the outbreak of war in the region. Fr. Sean Timmerman of Church of the Holy Spirit in Plattsmouth is one of the leaders of the group. He said they were about 90-percent complete with their tour of the holy sites in the region when the conflict began. ‚ÄúWe were near the Sea of Galilee in Nazareth when the war started,‚Äù Fr. Timmerman said. ‚ÄúSo we were farther away from the conflict and felt safe."" The group then returned to Jerusalem where they visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. ‚ÄúWe had good guides who we trusted. They said their number one priority was to keep us safe, ‚Äú Fr. Timmerman said. The group eventually was able to travel across the border into Jordan, where they are staying for several days. They have been advised to remain in the hotel today, which they have done. Small groups of them are scheduled on flights out each day over the course of the next five days. Fr. Timmerman said they are doing well considering the circumstances, but they are very much looking forward to getting back home. #HolyLand #pilgrimage #war",,392,"{'like_count': 137, 'comment_count': 66, 'num_users': 8087}",Bishop James Conley,,2023-10-13 20:26:40,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/276080483_392803386178260_5710957369207494121_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yDyfci8gOpsAX9erZTC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB0er-uEbnjriDtWvdC6SALZMOS8x_cjnUyzq5tUzKllA&oe=655B3235,https://www.facebook.com/100063458056143/posts/827741766017751,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387789935_827716279353633_3092382662262425591_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4PgKCCQMk6sAX94Qt_l&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCqM4leSSxd4nV-7fYWXLP2v9LlaSH6YAI0-1RYQf5u4Q&oe=655AE2E9

Tumagal sa limang minuto ang palitan ng putok bago nagsipulasan ang nasa tinatayang limang miyembro ng KLG North Abra. Nasamsam sa pinangyarihan ng labanan ang isang M16 rifle at inaalam pa ang pagkakakilanlan ng nasawing NPA. Samantala, naniniwala ang Abra Provincial Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (PTF-ELCAC) na ito ay isang patunay na mulat na ang mga mamamayan dahil sa patuloy at kusang pagbibigay ng impormasyon para matunton ang kinaroroonan ng mga natitrirang kasapi ng CPP-NPA. Tagumpay ito ng bawat mamamayan na gising na sa katotohanan at lantarang isinusuka ang komunismo. Kasabay ng walang tigil na pagtugis sa mga natitirang miyembro ng KLG North Abra ay ang tuloy tuloy rin na malawakang panawagan ng mga kasaping ahensya ng Provincial Task Force - ELCAC sa lahat ng mga armadong kasapi ng mga rebelde na bitawan na ang kanilang armas at talikuran na ang armadong pakikibaka para tamasahin ang mga benepisyong naghihintay sa kanila sa ilalim ng mga programang nakapaloob sa Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (ECLIP).#",,386,"{'like_count': 198, 'comment_count': 43, 'num_users': 95573}","5th Infantry ""Star"" Division, Philippine Army",,2023-10-13 14:20:50,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/344751234_1400211117500659_1414296849937691355_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yFfJX8Hw-2wAX9SHgrj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA9pTTVkSyMALdXAFnRbz8EcxVWQeMHl78pe7OY4dcHew&oe=655A6200,https://www.facebook.com/100064912081793/posts/713022720871458,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387075917_713022750871455_6740595593229885834_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=JCiUeQZz8eMAX-CN4zk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCN1_bsePcV0YsGrqB8Q9fI0eSoZ7XUqotM24b2IEsCWw&oe=652DDCE9
facebook,"We condemn the recent Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel. The brutality and dehumanizing violence is barbaric, grotesque and has genocidal intent. We mourn for those affected and grieve knowing that the devastation caused by these actions will endure for generations to come. Conflict in the Middle East can often be traced to the First World War. Lines were drawn, treaties written, promises were made then and since ‚Äì often without the participation of the very people and lands that they purported to help. A century later, we witness the ongoing suffering of millions of innocent people. The enduring impact of the Great War includes unintended consequences. History is difficult and complex. Often what appears to be a solution to the problem causes others to become more acute. Understanding our history can help us create sustainable solutions that uphold democratic values and honor the worth of all people. We stand with those who work for peace and informed decision-making. At the National WWI Museum and Memorial we seek to provide a forum for discussion and debate about the enduring impact of the Great War. We firmly believe there is no better path to understanding than by learning.

Perhaps you are going through a divorce or a marital conflict, feeling pain in your heart, and you want to draw near to God.
Perhaps you see this world as too dark and evil, feeling pessimistic and disappointed, and you want to draw near to God.
Perhaps you have lost loved ones, feeling grief and loneliness, and you want to draw near to God for comfort.
No matter what environment we are in, God knows the sorrow and pain in our hearts.
God says, ""When you are weary and when you begin to feel something of the bleak desolation of this world, do not be lost, do not cry. Almighty God, the Watcher, will embrace your arrival at any time. He is keeping watch by your side, waiting for you to turn back around. He is waiting for the day you suddenly recover your memory: when you realize that you came from God, that, at some unknown time you lost your direction, at some unknown time you lost consciousness on the road, and at some unknown time acquired a ‚Äòfather‚Äô; when you realize, furthermore, that the Almighty has always been keeping watch, waiting there a very, very long time for your return. He has been watching with desperate longing, waiting for a response without an answer. His watching and waiting are beyond any price, and they are for the sake of the human heart and the human spirit. Perhaps this watching and waiting are indefinite, and perhaps they are at an end. But you should know exactly where your heart and your spirit are right now.""""

Among its true stories is the narrative of Ishmael and Isaac, sons of Abraham, and the age-old conflict that traces its roots back to them. Today, we will unravel this tale and understand its implications for our world. While the Church is distinct from Israel and the covenants were made primarily with Israel, understanding these covenants is essential for grasping the full scope of God's redemptive plan. Recognizing and respecting these covenants allows the Church to have a richer and deeper understanding of its faith and the vastness of God's love and promises.",,364,"{'like_count': 102, 'comment_count': 149, 'num_users': 211387}",Todd Coconato,,2023-10-13 22:59:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/399951244_742836237654777_800893592783892627_n.jpg?stp=c37.43.1000.1000a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=rb5wJGzDHR8AX9sd5D4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD_MSv8f2Qx9w-AWmjhalbgxnoCHGGTgrx9Vw1VB7hc5Q&oe=655B7AB7,https://www.facebook.com/100057852211505/posts/2423565497846194,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/384522073_3944154755811605_813794805954588188_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=mFocJQfIxPQAX-ZObUi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAG06plWfGAzlBctXO7zeJSurgRxuUMZNDSU2Erg2ZUFw&oe=652E36FF

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel?  Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately.  Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.  But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.  Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.  And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.  And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.  Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.  But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13)  

The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7)  The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus.  The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets.  It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says.  Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God.  This is no time to follow popular opinions.  This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word.

So what's our assignment as Christians?
Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers.

So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

facebook,"INTERCONNECTED FOUNDATIONS: EXPLORING THE LINK BETWEEN LITERACY, PEACE, SECURITY, AND COUNTRY STABILITY 2023 National Literacy Conference Cebu City Mga kababayan, ladies and gentlemen, Assalamualaikum. Madayaw ug maayong adlaw kaninyong tanan. Magandang araw sa inyong lahat. Today, I would like to emphasize the crucial role of literacy in unlocking opportunities, empowering individuals, and driving our nation forward. The Department of Education stands at the forefront, paving the way for literacy development in our country through various programs and initiatives. Our goal is to promote functional literacy and ensure that every Filipino possesses the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in today's complex world. Functional literacy goes beyond simply reading and writing. It encompasses the skills necessary to apply this knowledge in real-life situations. It equips individuals with the ability to make informed decisions, communicate effectively, and actively participate in the workforce and society. To enhance functional literacy across all levels of education, the Department of Education has taken significant steps. Let me highlight some of the key initiatives undertaken by DepEd: First, the implementation of the K to 12 Program. This is one of the most notable reforms in our educational system. It provides a holistic and well-rounded education and emphasizes functional literacy through the incorporation of practical life skills, work education, and entrepreneurship in the curriculum. The recent revision of the K to 10 curriculum under the MATATAG Curriculum ensures the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, good manners, right conduct, peace education, and other essential skills. This revision acknowledges the evolving demands of the 21st century, where learners must analyze complex issues and adapt to rapidly changing environments. Second, we have the Alternative Learning Systems (ALS) program, which offers education to out-of-school youth and adults. ALS has significantly expanded access to education for those who may have missed formal schooling, providing not only basic literacy skills but also life skills. This program empowers marginalized individuals, promotes social inclusion, and offers them a chance to earn a formal diploma, leading to improved job prospects and increased self-esteem. Third, to ensure that school leaders and teachers are well-equipped to teach functional literacy, the Department of Education invests in teacher training and development programs. We contribute to the professional development of teachers through training programs, workshops, and seminars that enhance their teaching methods and keep them updated with the latest educational trends and approaches. Furthermore, DepEd actively collaborates with various organizations and stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector, to promote functional literacy. These partnerships aid in the development of educational materials, access to resources, and the implementation of innovative teaching methods. Through the Literacy Coordinating Council (LCC), the Department of Education strengthens its commitment to work with legislators and local government units (LGUs) to strengthen relevant policies and literacy support structures at the grassroots level. To date, more than 300 Local LCCs have been established by LGUs, ensuring community literacy mapping out in identifying out-of-school children, youth, and adults, and provide relevant literacy program interventions. Recognizing the outstanding efforts of partners and stakeholders in community-based literacy development, the LCC has awarded more than 300 LGUs and NGOs through its National Literacy Awards (NLA) program. Let me highlight an inspiring success story from the NLA winners: the Municipality of Kauswagan in Lanao Del Norte. The LCC recognized their outstanding literacy intervention called the ""From Battle Ground to School Ground.‚Äù This program has seen a scaled-up response in skills and literacy in conflict-affected areas, transforming communities into productive zones with sustained peace. It has successfully engaged both Muslim and Christian individuals, young and old, and improved the lives of many. This story exemplifies the contributions of LGUs in improving literacy rates and making a difference in the lives of Filipinos. Moreover, the LCC has developed literacy-related policies, frameworks, standards, and tools based on extensive research and empirical evidence. With the support of the Philippine Normal University, research and development work of the LCC has flourished. The outputs include the National Literacy Framework, standards and monitoring and evaluation tools for exemplary community-based literacy programs, benchmarks for adult literacy competencies, and the National Literacy Information System (NLIS). The NLIS provides a platform for the Council, member agencies, stakeholders, partners, and (truncated)",,328,"{'like_count': 179, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 26404}",Office of the Vice President of the Philippines,,2023-10-13 01:39:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/324017293_1113167796043261_7293428279905947819_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=XxG7MOLu-xAAX8We_aS&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCq9I2CnuVaTroDgT0NBlB-DUm8B4dojXF5QYXMQWBdQw&oe=6559DB1E,https://www.facebook.com/100089145255502/posts/293384656976374,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391695622_1248455735998635_5541051411166119994_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=qYr6GUrgkTQAX8s21IQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBJTbvC4rtFTAG_0T8eknYkMh0bxeWU9IN47anOaMygCA&oe=65328AC4

Her statement came after Israeli forces warned more than 1 million residents in the north of Gaza to move south within 24 hours. The international community cannot look the other way Diaz posted on the social media platform X. The EU must demand that Israel stop the plans that are causing a massacre Diaz is the head of Spain‚Äôs far-left Sumar party, which is a junior partner in Spain‚Äôs acting coalition government. She called on Spain and the EU ‚Äúto urgently mobilise for peace.‚Äù Earlier this week, Spanish Foreign Minister, Jose Manuel Albares, said the entire government condemns Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel, but agrees that any military response must fall within international law. The UN has warned that Israel‚Äôs order to evacuate the north of Gaza amid constant bombing would be impossible ‚Äúwithout devastating humanitarian consequences.‚Äù Spain is one of the few Western countries that announced it is boosting its aid to Palestine amid the conflict. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt confuse Hamas with the Palestinian people,‚Äù Albares said on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWhat we are going to need in the days to come isn‚Äôt less aid; it‚Äôs more humanitarian aid for Palestinians.‚Äù According to El Pais, Spain‚Äôs Foreign Ministry is also coordinating with other European countries to try to evacuate the estimated 120 Spanish citizens from the besieged Gaza Strip. But, at the moment, officials said it is impossible to enter or leave Gaza. To facilitate evacuations, Spanish authorities told El Pais that they would need permission from Israel, Hamas and likely the collaboration of Egypt. Raquel Marti, Executive Director of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Spain told El Pais that humanitarian corridors are vital for letting people out and letting aid in. ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt receiving everything they need because we are rationing since we don‚Äôt know how long this will last. ‚ÄúIf border crossings are not opened, in 11 days we will stop delivering water, food, hygiene products and medicines,‚Äù she said. https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231013-spains-deputy-pm-urges-europe-to-help-stop-massacre-in-gaza/",,302,"{'like_count': 186, 'comment_count': 18, 'num_users': 55247}","Jerusalem ""Al-Quds"" is the Capital of Palestine",,2023-10-13 18:10:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/312527672_484986470335695_4514270114700884458_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8UHp-40wnjMAX_Hovot&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDmz2zrXECPUkrs4DgvQ_IuMGyvRfV0_xvMpvty9lpBLg&oe=655A118F,https://www.facebook.com/100064730374657/posts/721911833309823,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387092839_721911799976493_2072785044583133566_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=hDhslQ7nieQAX99Ie43&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDe0fefuimib28Yc4KQJiUpZc0-DQWSIFRBmoK87iaz6A&oe=652E6733

facebook,"STATEMENT ON ISRAEL CONFLICT FROM THE NATIONAL SHERIFFS‚Äô ASSOCIATION Washington, DC, October 12, 2023 - The National Sheriffs‚Äô Association (NSA) today denounced in the strongest of terms the inhumane, criminal and unprovoked attack against the people and institutions of Israel by the terror group Hamas. Also, NSA is calling for a day of vigilance and honor on Friday October 13, 2023. Casualty reports from Israel demonstrate once again the men and women of law enforcement bore the brunt of the initial attacks from the Hamas attacks in southern-Israel. The police officers carried an imaginable burden responding to an overwhelming force of heavily armed terrorists sworn to kill, torture and kidnap innocent civilians ‚Äì including children. ‚ÄúCowardly terror groups are calling on support of the Hamas by using Friday October 13 as a day of rage and uprising, it is nothing more than overt threat to encourage and foment hatred,‚Äù explained Sheriff Greg Champagne, president of the National Sheriffs‚Äô Association.‚Äù ""Once again, we saw the evil face of terror and its reviled intentions. Every Sheriff and the NSA rejects this in no uncertain terms. Instead, we encourage law enforcement of the United States to use tomorrow as a day to stand with law enforcement and against terror of all kinds. Tomorrow, October 13, 2023, should be a day of vigilance, and a nationwide day of honor for those sworn to uphold the law. For those that have a ‚Äòthin-blue-line‚Äô patch, sticker, or insignia we encourage you to wear it tomorrow in honor of those who died protecting Israel and their communities.‚Äù NSA joins in the universal call for civilized nations to stand in honor with these brave officers. It calls upon its members to collaborate with their peers in law enforcement and join together in prayer and promote civil actions of support for the families of the fallen officers of the Israel Police. The NSA honors and recognizes the bravery and heroism of those members of law enforcement, and the innocent civilians who died in the Hamas attacks against Israel.",,294,"{'like_count': 124, 'comment_count': 26, 'num_users': 11312}","Greene County, Va.

facebook,"The crisis in the Middle East has reached a new level of horror. Already there have been thousands of victims, Israeli and Palestinian. The Gaza Strip is under blockade, as it has been since 2007. It is starved of food, water and electricity and being brutally bombarded. Israeli forces are massing on its borders, apparently preparing to invade the territory. As well as bringing terror to the people of Gaza, such an action risks sparking a wider war. The conflict can only be understood in the context of decades of oppression of the Palestinian people. Since the Nakba in 1948 when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were driven off their land, the Israelis have forced the Palestinian people into smaller and smaller, heavily policed enclaves, regularly attacked by settlers and the Israeli military. There can be no solution to the conflict without freedom and justice for the Palestinians. The British government is one of the world‚Äôs strongest backers of Israel, as we have seen with the deployment of RAF boats to support Israel's offensive. We will continue to campaign in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against our government‚Äôs military and political support for the increasingly aggressive Israeli state.

facebook,"Humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens as conflict intensifies #Gaza's only power station has stopped working after the fuel needed for generating electricity ran out on Wednesday, Gaza officials said, sparking great concern over the #humanitarian situation in the enclave as the #IsraeliPalestinianConflict rages on. ""The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially,"" United Nations (#UN) Secretary-General #AntonioGuterres warned early this week. INTENSIFIED CONFLICT The Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) on Saturday launched a surprise attack on southern Israeli towns adjacent to the Gaza Strip, prompting Israel to launch retaliatory strikes on Gaza. Hamas military commander Mohammad Deif said the attack was in response to Israel's blockade of Gaza, its frequent raids on the West Bank over the past year, its storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound -- a site holy to both Muslims and Jews -- Israeli settlers' attacks on Palestinians and the expansion of Israeli settlements. In response to the attack, the Israeli military launched the operation ""Swords of Iron,"" carrying out dozens of airstrikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. As of Thursday, the death toll of Palestinians from the ongoing Israeli airstrikes has reached 1,500 while about 6,600 Palestinians were wounded by the Israeli army, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. On the Israeli side, the number of fatalities due to the Hamas attack has reached at least 1,300 and the number of injured in Israel surpassed 3,000, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported Thursday. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said in a statement on Wednesday that 11 of its employees have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Saturday. DIRE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION Shortly after the Hamas attack, Israel enforced ""a complete siege"" on the Gaza Strip, cutting off the water, electricity and fuel supply to the enclave. Those moves coupled with the ongoing airstrikes have made the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza even worse. The number of people displaced across Gaza has topped 263,000 with more than 175,000 of them taking shelter in the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Wednesday. More than 1,000 housing units in Gaza have been destroyed, and some 560 have been severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable. All 13 hospitals and other health facilities in Gaza are only partially operational due to supply shortages and fuel rationing, said the OCHA. The World Food Programme (WFP) has begun distributing food for up to 100,000 internally displaced people in Gaza, who are seeking refuge in UNRWA shelters, with fresh bread and canned food, said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary-General. ""Civilians must be respected and protected at all times. Civilian infrastructure must never be a target,"" said Guterres, adding that medical equipment, food, fuel and other humanitarian supplies are desperately needed, along with access for humanitarian personnel. Israel needs to respect international humanitarian law when it comes to defending itself on the ground during the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict, High Representative of the European Union (EU) for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell has said.",,286,"{'like_count': 167, 'comment_count': 33, 'num_users': 25759240}",WE ARE CHINA,,2023-10-13 06:43:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/277564036_287538660231268_7474678277282447606_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YFiFkVtZNyMAX96qvD_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC9p0k0ydLeFm-KmZAEBmY2Oza5VL5FuRSupVkpPU78Ow&oe=655B5AF2,https://www.facebook.com/100069254077822/posts/691243249860805,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387114413_691228433195620_566494344940166299_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=e0GqDCl88iAAX_4uPTC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDSJcx2v1oUece2YftMsklFijhQRyw1fBWdFYd3XdJLEQ&oe=65331108
facebook,"OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTIES BY PRIESTS IN THE CHURCH: UNRAVELLING THE ISSUES BETWEEN REV. FR. PROF . PAUL OBAYI AND THE CHURCH/BISHOP ONAH I took time to watch the over 30-minute live video of Fr. Paul Obayi, narrating his painful ordeal in the hands of the Bishop and the Catholic Diocese of Nsukka. My takeaway from the video is that the good priest, who happens to be a Professor of Communication, taught by the same professors who taught me, seems to be having slight identity crises. This is because I am sure that the highly educated priest professor knows the true and authentic history of the Catholic Church. He must as well have been taught and properly drills on the events that led to the policies and dogmas of the church during his years as a philosophy and theology student. Even if he didn't, I am sure that some postgraduate classes with Prof. Ike. S. Ndolo or Propaganda Formulation and management should have clarified him a bit more. This knowledge acquired over time should have been more than enough to equip Fr. Obayi to understand that a priest of the Catholic Church does not have the right to own properties. Historically, the reason why Priests are not allowed to get married is not to keep them holy, no, it is to preserve the properties of the church so that the wives and children of priests won't grow to start demanding the transfer of the Church's properties to them. Before the year 1123, priests, bishops, and popes were allowed to have wives and children. However, upon their death, their children would take the church to court and reclaim all their father's properties, including church buildings. It became rampant that Catholic priests built churches and parish houses with people's donations and contributions to the church, only for their wives and children to throw the worshippers away and reclaim the church as their father's properties. To solve this problem, Pope Benedict VIII in 1018, formally forbade priestly marriages. About a hundred years later, it was formally adopted by the First Lateran Council of 1123. It would take nearly 300 years before it was fully implemented as most priests kept wives and children unofficially as house helps, since keeping them unofficially guaranteed that they won't take away the properties of the church through Court Litigations. Therefore, it is surprising for a priest who is exposed to such or even greater depth of knowledge to say that he owns any property. According to the Canon and Vatican laws, a priest owns nothing. A priest is as good as a dead man. Anything bought in his name was automatically bought in the name of the Church. Even his clothes and shoes. That's why it is the duty of the church to house him, clothe him, feed him, and provide everything he needs. Also, the church does not approve of a lot of things he does in the Adoration as the church sees them as superstitious acts and the preachings that when you throw powder, you may get favours, all sound heretic to the church. When I was president of the St. Theresa's Cathedral Parish Blockrosary Crusade, I took it upon myself to understand the faith I profess. So, I read about three different accounts of the history of the Catholic Church, some of which their authors include Alan Shrek and Rev. J. Dacruz. I understood in clear terms what the church was all about. So that in 2019/2020 when my understanding of the person and being of God began to conflict with the teachings of the Catholic Church, I voluntarily withdrew from being a practicing Christian, and only identify as a Christian for political reasons. Therefore, Fr. Obayi, whom I believe in all sincerity is more knowledgeable than me, should renounce priesthood peacefully if he has the intention of owning properties that are against the rules of the church. He should accept the treatments he is getting the way the priest governor happily accepted his suspension and the way the other married priest also accepted his suspension. There is no need to whip up sentiments and play on the emotions of people. When an institution you are under stops no longer agrees with your personal convictions, instead of sticking on and having identity crises, it's better to withdraw and actualize your full potential. Both Rev. Prof. Martins Paul Obayi and Most. Rev. Prof. Igwebuike Godfrey Onah are great sons of Nsukka who have brought good things to the diocese and the community. It's important that they continue to do their good works for the zone and not be hindered by Dogma. If the Okunerere Adoration Ministry work is more important for Fr. Paul than his priestly calling, he should tow the way of Fr. Hyacinth Iormem Alia, who believes that rescuing Benue State is more important than his priestly calling at least for the next 8 years. He should step down and focus on the Adoration so he can be free from the Church the way Fr. Alia is now free from the Church. Let there be no seed of discord and let love and peace reign, Amen. > Obetta Ujunwa (truncated)",,284,"{'like_count': 81, 'comment_count': 149, 'num_users': 78660}",APGA Interactive Forum [AIF Media] - Checking on Our Leaders...,,2023-10-13 19:11:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/399086084_7066719033372832_3970839189998648189_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=2WtWy8CNI6YAX9GR2b2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBc2BjZ-c-Rbj28Wy-gSM_QLwyxleVlsQtJ9mcVIeEJ3A&oe=655B78F8,https://www.facebook.com/groups/539554826108956/permalink/7105057876225252,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391627757_6662607137153057_2985049147714600817_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=ry_leu6rRZ4AX-Jdfpk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDipTneatIzO6nHU6aMpEyJgATPcsRKrf1kkY73i1NCZw&oe=652EF224

facebook,"Calmness in Times of Conflict ""If a wise man has an argument with a fool, the fool only rages and laughs, and there is no quiet."" ‚ÄìProverbs 29:9 ESV This verse encourages us to keep calm in the face of foolishness. When we encounter someone who is stubborn, ignorant, or even hostile, we should not give in to the temptation to lash out or escalate the situation. Rather, we should approach them with patience, gentleness, and a willingness to listen. We should speak truth with love, and seek to persuade them with reason and evidence, rather than resorting to anger or insults. Of course, this is easier said than done. It can be frustrating and even infuriating to deal with people who seem incapable of seeing reason or acknowledging their own errors. It can be tempting to give up on them altogether, or to simply abandon any hope of having a productive conversation. But as followers of Christ, we are called to a higher standard. We are called to love our neighbors, even our enemies, and to seek their good, even when it is difficult or uncomfortable. So, let us keep in mind the wisdom of Proverbs 29:9, and let us pray for the grace and strength to follow it. May the Lord give us the wisdom to discern truth from error, the patience to bear with those who are foolish, and the courage to speak his truth in love.",,282,"{'like_count': 83, 'comment_count': 17, 'num_users': 30591}",Be Refreshed by God's Word,,2023-10-13 22:22:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/309413906_487219256749307_4349272749247770872_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=nA2MOCFJMnQAX-ZwIfA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA_m6ueUoyuHrtx6oGv6_ZON7Cn3oip_SSfjC1E3NDkxQ&oe=655B99DB,https://www.facebook.com/100063837094893/posts/747220434082520,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391696460_747220357415861_1813302962792531994_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7XaTrwYeS7MAX-SLOsc&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDN7-hYDtq7p0H-GIp8awVqiFNfQWY84Ll0TJSrSuX9zw&oe=652F6D22

facebook,"Some misguided, ignorant people continue to believe that murderous incursions such as Hamas' attack on Israel, or its endless bombardment by rockets launched from Gaza, are acts of resistance and fight for liberation of Palestinian people, so that they can have their own country. They're not and Hamas says as much itself. Even ignoring the fact that Gaza has been under self-governance of Hamas for the past 16 years AND is dependent on water and electricity rather generously supplied by Israel, and even if we assume that it is under some unbearable restrictions (largely self-inflicted), the fact is that even Hamas itself specifically claims what its goals are. And that is the destruction of Israel. üî¥ Here are a few quotes from Hamas' own, updated and already toned down charter it released in 2017: ""The establishment of ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù is entirely illegal and contravenes the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and goes against their will and the will of the Ummah."" ""There shall be no recognition of the legitimacy of the Zionist entity."" ""Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea."" ------ Few people seem to be aware that the enduring blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt stems i.a. from the fact that Hamas, when it was voted into power over Palestinian Territories in 2006, rejected agreements made by previous administrations - that is the signed peace accords and recognition of Israel. It's easy to see that in these circumstances there can be no discussion about a two-state solution, given that the other party doesn't even recognise the other state's existence - or its right to it - and continues to state its goals as complete takeover of all of the lands of Israel, ""from the river to the sea"". It is also important to stress that it's not just a statement by a radical, extremist group operating on the political margins (like, say, Al-Qaeda or ISIS did) but one of the largest parties in Palestinian Territories, which was voted into power the last time elections took place, and one which would likely win again if a vote was held today. This means that a likely majority of Palestinians do not think Israel should exist at all. In this context the only fight for liberation is one that obliterates Israel - which, obviously, Jews are not going to accept :) So, it isn't about a group of supposedly oppressed people fighting for their right to self-determination but hopeless extremism whose ridiculous aim is to destroy Israel and build a Palestinian state on its ruins. It's pretty clear, then, that Palestinians are not so much oppressed as wannabe oppressors, forever hopeful their moment will come. Now, you may or may not believe that a 2-state solution could somehow end the conflict - that's an entirely separate discussion. But you have to acknowledge that it cannot even be considered if Palestinians themselves think there should only be one state - theirs.",,280,"{'like_count': 198, 'comment_count': 52, 'num_users': 30072}",Critical Spectator,,2023-10-13 04:23:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352238793_654473106721732_8208518943407117173_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8x1dfcAuWJAAX-vhCco&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDoyth8BBPqVJqadFMrpRKihzW7HjUjoWULue8-_w1Hsw&oe=6559EC35,https://www.facebook.com/100044208020618/posts/883073523176240,

Every civilian killed - Palestinian or Israeli - is a tragedy that builds new barriers to peace. The loss of life, particularly of children, is unbearable.

Hamas terrorists that kill innocent civilians going about their daily lives and take them as hostages are committing war crimes. Any response has to be in line with international law and without collective punishment. The alarming news of 1.1 million Gazans being told to flee, exacerbates the humanitarian crisis. If ever there was a time to understand the importance of establishing peace in the Middle East, this week is a tragic reminder of why we need to play our role. There is a dire need of leadership in the international community to find a political solution to this crisis. A solution which enforces international law, upholds human rights, and ensures a two-state solution in the region, with a viable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.

facebook,"Mum Bett was one of the first enslaved black American to sue for freedom and win in Massachusetts. As a free woman she took up the name Elizabeth Freeman. She was W.E.B Du Bios great grandmother. Her case served as precedent in the state that brought an end to the practice of slavery in Massachusetts. Freeman's real age was never known, but an estimate on her tombstone puts her age at about 85. She was buried in the Sedgwick family plot in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. She died in 1829. Freeman was among the first enslaved black Americans in Massachusetts to file a ""freedom suit"" and win in court under the 1780 constitution, with a ruling that slavery was illegal. Her county court case, Brom and Bett v. Ashley, decided in August 1781, was cited as a precedent in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court appeal review of Quock Walker's ""freedom suit"". When the state Supreme Court upheld Walker's freedom under the constitution, the ruling was considered to have informally ended slavery in the state. LIFE & TRIAL: Elizabeth Freeman was illiterate and left no written records of her life. Her early history has been pieced together from the writings of contemporaries to whom she told her story or who heard it indirectly, as well as from historical records. Freeman was born into slavery about 1742 at the farm of Pieter Hogeboom in Claverack, New York, where she was given the name Bett. When his daughter Hannah married John Ashley of Sheffield, Massachusetts, Hogeboom gave Bett, then in her early teens, to them. She remained with them until 1781, during which time she married and had a child, Betsy. Her husband (name unknown, marriage unrecorded) never returned from service in the Revolutionary War. Throughout her life, Bett exhibited a strong spirit and sense of self. She came into conflict with Hannah Ashley, who was raised in the strict Dutch culture of the New York colony. In 1780, Bett prevented Hannah from striking her daughter Betsy with a heated shovel, but Elizabeth shielded her daughter and received a deep wound in her arm. As the wound healed, Bett left it uncovered as evidence of her harsh treatment. Soon after the Revolutionary War, Freeman heard the constitution read at Sheffield and these words: ‚Äú All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness."" ‚ÄîMassachusetts Constitution, Article 1. Bett sought the counsel of Theodore Sedgwick, a young abolition-minded lawyer, to help her sue for freedom in court. Sedgwick willingly accepted her case. He enlisted the aid of Tapping Reeve, the founder of America's first law school, located at Litchfield, Connecticut. The case of Brom and Bett vs. Ashley was heard in August 1781 before the County Court of Common Pleas in Great Barrington. Sedgwick and Reeve asserted that the constitutional provision that ""all men are born free and equal"" effectively abolished slavery in the state. When the jury ruled in Bett's favor, she became the first African-American woman to be set free under the Massachusetts state constitution. The court assessed damages of thirty shillings and awarded her compensation for their labor. After the ruling, Bett took the names Elizabeth Freeman. LEGACY: The decision in the case of Elizabeth Freeman was cited as precedent when the State Supreme Judicial Court heard the appeal of Quock Walker v. Jennison. Walker's freedom was upheld. These cases set the legal precedents that ended slavery in Massachusetts. Vermont had already abolished it explicitly in its constitution. üñãÔ∏èif you love our content, please consider supporting our page on AfricanArchives.Support (follow the ko-fi page too for weekly posts roundup)",,276,"{'like_count': 123, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 204220}",African and Black History AfricanArchives,,2023-10-13 12:18:36,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/272995203_4517309601712705_4152671883661453704_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=n9pWrmOLBVwAX-CDLCJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAzpruDFrTTmQIfBLLL_pkKuiXdEd3n6D5IVR8_b4IdbQ&oe=655A1645,https://www.facebook.com/100064642393644/posts/702893961875344,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387073937_702893905208683_6840349110350899112_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=wdWD2_7dUEEAX8g-jL_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAZTZTeHzcIAFyIlpMrpWtAMsZgNafv07vpfgAYICuRwQ&oe=652F3660

facebook,"STATEMENT ON ISRAEL CONFLICT FROM THE NATIONAL SHERIFFS‚Äô ASSOCIATION Washington, DC, October 12, 2023 - The National Sheriffs‚Äô Association (NSA) today denounced in the strongest of terms the inhumane, criminal and unprovoked attack against the people and institutions of Israel by the terror group Hamas. Also, NSA is calling for a day of vigilance and honor on Friday October 13, 2023. Casualty reports from Israel demonstrate once again the men and women of law enforcement bore the brunt of the initial attacks from the Hamas attacks in southern-Israel. The police officers carried an imaginable burden responding to an overwhelming force of heavily armed terrorists sworn to kill, torture and kidnap innocent civilians ‚Äì including children. ‚ÄúCowardly terror groups are calling on support of the Hamas by using Friday October 13 as a day of rage and uprising, it is nothing more than overt threat to encourage and foment hatred,‚Äù explained Sheriff Greg Champagne, president of the National Sheriffs‚Äô Association.‚Äù ‚ÄúOnce again, we saw the evil face of terror and its reviled intentions. Every Sheriff and the NSA rejects this in no uncertain terms. Instead, we encourage law enforcement of the United States to use tomorrow as a day to stand with law enforcement and against terror of all kinds. Tomorrow, October 13, 2023, should be a day of vigilance, and a nationwide day of honor for those sworn to uphold the law. For those that have a ‚Äòthin-blue-line‚Äô patch, sticker, or insignia we encourage you to wear it tomorrow in honor of those who died protecting Israel and their communities.‚Äù NSA joins in the universal call for civilized nations to stand in honor with these brave officers. It calls upon its members to collaborate with their peers in law enforcement and join together in prayer and promote civil actions of support for the families of the fallen officers of the Israel Police. The NSA honors and recognizes the bravery and heroism of those members of law enforcement, and the innocent civilians who died in the Hamas attacks against Israel.",,275,"{'like_count': 113, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 7354}",Fluvanna County Sheriff's Office,,2023-10-13 00:14:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/272660978_303133901852676_5786077273571393045_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=WDMlo4NHl4sAX8UG4T_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB_-Rfg-Wois7Zsz1CkglMwxk1OgneXbaN-AhDaVtBheA&oe=655AF777,https://www.facebook.com/100064682049616/posts/720433120122750,

facebook,"Qantas evacuation flight on the way to rescue stranded Australians in Israel Charles Miranda October 13, 2023 5:25 pm https://www.flightradar24.com/ASY1168/326ad55b The first of two Qantas flights has left London bound for Tel Aviv to collect hundreds of stranded and desperate Australians looking to flee the conflict. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE Flight ASY1168 VH-ZNN Snowy River, the 236-seater 787-9 Dreamliner, had to be pulled from its normal commercial international route to Australia to make the trip to the Israeli capital with three senior captains on board. Qantas does not normally fly into Tel Aviv, so it has also had to carry, as well as a full cabin crew, specialist ground crew to board the passengers, engineers and medical personnel. The aircraft is carrying enough fuel to make the round trip to and from London without refuelling, about a five-hour flight. The mammoth operation to reroute the aircraft at short notice to make the rescue mission is being coordinated from an Integrated Operations Centre at Qantas headquarters in Mascot, Sydney. Personnel from 15 different areas of the business had to come together along with embedded DFAT officials to see the flight through, given the complexity of flying to a new airport and flight path destination and during a declared war. The second flight will leave Sunday on the same run as the first and then next Tuesday the larger Airbus A380 will fly the passengers from London to Sydney via Singapore. Qantas agreed to pick up all the costs for the flight, which is free for passengers, as it has done for other mercy flights. ‚ÄúGiven the uncertain situation in the region, these flights are subject to ongoing safety and security assessments, and regulatory approvals in several countries,‚Äù Qantas‚Äô head of Integrated Operations Centre Daniel Dihen said ‚ÄúMore than 900 Qantas crew put their hands up to operate these flights, far exceeding the 70 required. We sincerely thank all of them, and all those working behind the scenes to make these special assistance flights possible.‚Äù The national carrier has a proud history of flying into war zones beginning in World War 2 carrying US and Australian troops into battle, evacuating after the fall of Saigon during the Vietnam War, the Iraq war in 2003 then part of the biggest airlift in history after the fall of Kabul in Afghanistan where it collected refugees and others from a military air base in the UAE. In January 1993 a Qantas B747 made two flights as it joined the ADF‚Äôs Operation Solace and delivered 644 soldiers, mostly from 1RAR in Townsville, to Mogadishu ‚Äúwar zone‚Äù as part of a UN backed mission to regain order in the country torn apart by feuding warlords. Crews were fired on from the perimeter fence of the airstrip forcing the ADF troops, yet to unload weapons, to scramble from the apron.

Yes, many of the reasons track back to the man not paying full attention to his own emotions for her at the beginning but it is not always so. A man can start out with full affections and wake up one day to find it all gone. Unfortunately, the lady begins to try it all; sexual remedies, lingeries, new styles and new meal recipes but really, how does one find the solution to an issue whose trigger you don't understand? This is where effective nuptial communication comes into play but then many have no idea what it is or how to put it into use. You'd see her and feel nothing. Spark gone. The sex is affected too, she knows it is but you are too far gone to notice that turgidity is not even happening for you....then that leads to talks about the possibility of an erectile issue but deep down, when you refuse to take the pills, herbs and miss appointments, you know it's because the emotions are simply gone. Sometimes you want to leave, but you know it would feel wicked yet, (you know it probably is) but within you, your heart is already elsewhere. A place where the smile costs nothing, the conversation is endless and the sync seems perfectly aligned. A place of little things and conflicts that end up in seemingly beautiful things and non conflict places. For others, it is not as complicated because this began with the feeling that the home became a warfront, a place of intimidation and fear perpetrated by she who should be a significant other.....yet, if the desire is to truly create or recreate emotions lost from home, the solutions lie at home, and in you. ------------------------- You want to go and try again, together, but how can you resolve an issue you dare not share? Good friends would come in handy here but half of them are doing worse, and the other half would just crush and blame. Again, if the desire is to truly create or recreate emotions lost from home, the solutions lie at home, and in you. Speak with someone you can trust to stay neutral and help you back to where you need to be.",,266,"{'like_count': 230, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 194092}",Shamseddin Giwa,,2023-10-13 05:39:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/137333751_231958495052524_9117510877621878738_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=ugFPx5PrVcsAX9CKEvk&_nc_oc=AQnK_2xOVgoIqN1ZYkk-c3ek2AsmIt9AMDJ3w41KhtsqtDLoooxQ-led9zBfAvGXxno&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDwvB3V7vClWdMoh4nKN9bh4J2ag9KbgWbYWN-2lXzxOg&oe=657D35AB,https://www.facebook.com/100047151253398/posts/851488283099539,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391642938_851488253099542_3516788278181770207_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=sAa81oYeQtMAX-sO63N&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAxzs9M42wBb4tUHwziBi1IKw4dFf92cp67Cv1Jc_2Uuw&oe=6544B7AB

facebook,"The Chess Scene This post was prompted by another post regarding the intentional destruction of the camp. While this scene has been discussed quite often, I do not personally subscribe to the theory that MacReady gave Childs a Molotov cocktail to drink, since I assume that a perfect imitation would know the difference; therefore, that element of the scene will be outside the scope of my post, along with the question as to whether Childs was a Thing. I think that the chess scene was important for two main reasons - it provided characterization for MacReady and it foreshadowed MacReady's future conflict with the Thing. Regarding the characterization aspect, we are introduced to a man who likes his booze, who is somewhat aloof from the rest of the group, and who is presumably a strategic thinker since he enjoys playing chess. It's worth noting that forty years ago, there was more of a stigma or stereotype associated with chess, video games, and computers that does not exist today, so I think that it's fair to state that given the context of its time, the movie wanted to show us that MacReady was smart. In addition, we see his reaction to losing a game of chess. While I won't argue that the computer actually cheated, if you look at the board before the computer declares ""Rook to Knight six,"" it is apparent that there was no move the black Rook could have made that would have resulted in checkmate (the white King could have moved one space left to either eliminate or avoid the black Rook). This can easily be attributed to filmmaker error or lack of care so I won't dwell on it, but what's important is that MacReady decided to ""flip the table"" rather than accept defeat. He might not win this game of chess, but the computer would be destroyed in a scorched earth ploy. This scene was somewhat of a microcosm of the rest of the movie and foreshadowed the ending. When MacReady assumed command of the group, he engaged in a metaphorical game of chess against the Thing. The Thing clearly identified MacReady as a threat and engaged in its own strategic moves, which is why the Thing was keen to frame MacReady. After the blood test scene, MacReady finally had the upper hand, just as he thought he did during the chess scene when he stated, ""Poor baby, you're starting to lose it, aren't you?"" However, the Thing essentially ""cheated"" to avoid defeat. Rather than continuing its game of strategy against MacReady, it decided to remove the camp's generator so that it, and everyone else, would freeze. At that moment, MacReady knew that he had lost the game and explicitly acknowledged that they were all dead men. However, rather than accept defeat, he again ""flipped the table"" and went scorched earth by destroying the entire camp and presumably killing Blair-Thing rather than allowing it to go into hibernation (although that's another discussion as to whether Blair-Thing was actually destroyed).",,263,"{'like_count': 152, 'comment_count': 72, 'num_users': 60481}",John Carpenter's The Thing,,2023-10-13 14:57:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/94246455_10157041947326954_2026125103623831552_n.jpg?stp=c13.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=zHl1IG2N_vAAX-astEP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDXXbUt5kNqcIe9i0y8i_jD2ST-040iAd19cieAgG-__Q&oe=657D0A0F,https://www.facebook.com/groups/2464905776/permalink/10159661162635777,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391638627_10159943973687644_175246811200709970_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=DuGva8LhPOYAX8p5Nvi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDiXmX-euHRgvJU0V2HptDWDbS6QsLQuRJRI3Es9OTPhg&oe=652FBB25

facebook,"The Ju 52 was similar to the company's previous Junkers W 33, although larger. In 1930, German aeronautical engineer Ernst Zindel and his team designed the Ju 52 at the Junkers works at Dessau. According to aviation author J. Richard Smith, the Ju 52 directly drew upon the company's First World War-era Junkers J 1 - the world's first all-metal aeroplane. On 13 October 1930, the first prototype, designated Ju 52ba, performed the type's maiden flight; it was initially powered by a single Junkers-built liquid-cooled V-12 engine, capable of generating up to 800 hp. During the aircraft's extensive trials, it was reengined with a 755 hp BMW IV water-cooled inline-6 powerplant. The second prototype, designated Ju 52de, featured an increased wing span and was powered by the BMW IV engine at first; it was soon reengined with the 750 hp 14-cylinder twin-row air-cooled radial Armstrong Siddeley Leopard and re-designated Ju 52di. Later on, the Ju 52di was again reengined with the 750 hp Junkers Jumo 204 air-cooled inverted inline-6, after which it was re-designated Ju 52do. The third prototype, designated Ju 52ce, had a strengthened structure, a modified leading edge, and was fitted with both a wheeled and float undercarriages. During May 1931, one of the prototypes, designated Ju 52cai, was written off after a crash. While these initial aircraft had been powered by a single engine, Junkers decided to develop the Ju 52 into a trimotor configuration. Accordingly, the Ju 52/3m (drei motoren‚Äî""three engines"") was developed, being powered by an arrangement of three radial engines. According to Smith, the earliest known Ju 52/3m was delivered to Bolivian airline Lloyd A√©reo Boliviano during 1932. During its initial production years, airlines were the type's most common customers. By the mid-1930s, the Ju 52/3mce and Ju 52/3fe, were the two primary production variants, both being powered by the BMW 132 radial engine. During 1934, work commenced on a militarised model of the Ju 52/3m, designated Ju 52/3mg3e, on behalf of the then-secret Luftwaffe. This model could function as a medium bomber, being furnished with a pair of defensive gun turrets and operated by a crew of four. Between 1934 and 1935, a total of 450 Ju 52/3mg3e aircraft were delivered to the Luftwaffe. Numerous improved models would be introduced prior to and during the Second World War. The dominant production model was the Ju 52/3mg7e, featuring advances such as an autopilot, enlarged doors to the cabin, and other general enhancements.[5] It was configured as a pure transport aircraft, being capable of carrying up to 18 fully-equipped troops. Defensive armaments comprised a dorsal-mounted 13 mm MG 131 machine gun and a pair of sideways-mounted 7.9mm MG 15 machine guns.[5] Successive models saw other improvements, such as revised glazing, newer engines, undercarriage strengthening, and increased take-off weight. The final wartime model to be developed, designated Ju 52/3mg14e, featured improved armour protection for the pilot and a bolstered defensive armament. From mid-1943 onwards, the Luftwaffe began to make less use of the Ju 52, interest having waned in the type. German officials were interested in procuring a successor to the type; at one stage, the Reich Air Ministry showed enthusiasm for the Junkers Ju 352, a larger transport aircraft somewhat resembling the Ju 52. Actions were taken to convert Junkers' Ju 52 production lines to instead manufacture Ju 352s; however, the conflict's end in May 1945 led to the effort being abandoned in an unfinished state. As such, German production of the Ju 52 was terminated during 1944; Smith claims that a total of 3,234 aircraft of various models were constructed during the conflict. In the postwar era, manufacture of the Ju 52 resumed, albeit in foreign countries. It was constructed in France by Avions Amiot as the Amiot AAC.1 Toucan; it was also produced in Spain by Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (CASA) as the CASA 352. A handful of captured wartime aircraft were also rebuilt by Short Brothers of Northern Ireland for civilian service. Development of the Ju 52 commenced during 1930, headed by German aeronautical engineer Ernst Zindel. The aircraft's design incorporated a corrugated duralumin metal skin as a strengthening measure, which was very unusual at the time. The Ju 52's maiden flight was performed on 13 October 1930. It was initially designed with a single engine; however, it was produced in quantity as a trimotor. The primary early production model, the Ju 52/3m, was principally operated as a 17-seat airliner or utility transport aircraft by various civil operators during the 1930s. Following the rise of Nazi Germany, thousands of Ju 52s were procured as a staple military transport of the nation. The Ju 52/3mg7e was the principal production model. The Ju 52 was in production between 1931 and 1952. In a civilian role, it flew with over 12 airlines, including Swissair and Deutsche Luft Hansa, as both (truncated)",,259,"{'like_count': 214, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 86743}",Steel_Eagles,,2023-10-13 19:00:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339922325_608149581212194_7056641449169656168_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=C_aQx0sH6q0AX94oxtT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBd7n0SkNNuLZDC0AwELEED31xUzmVMr4N3jFp1cwTM1w&oe=655AA3BD,https://www.facebook.com/100091756594145/posts/234588502943035,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391588296_234588589609693_3366206513821531669_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=DXr5TP5KnuMAX-3qVhz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAnoU0im_buqDbl-EnKEM_bt34mT4PujzFCuP5EqxDebg&oe=65345F66

Funny enough, I tried sparking up arguments whenever she visited, complained bitterly about anything she did but it didn't work She would either tell me ""I'm sorry my love, you know I didn't mean to offend you"" and smile that her irresistible smile and before I realise, I would be smiling myself... Or she would look at me with her baby face until I apologize. She never shouted back or spoke rudely...until one day, I made the mistake of asking her why she never picked a quarrel ""You never shout or speak back at me, you're always too cool...I don't know if you will even be able to handle conflict in marriage sef..."" I complained She looked at me, shocked and surprised at the same time... ""So you want us to be quarreling?"" She asked ""No, but...you know, arguments bring better understanding in relationships"" I explained bluntly ""You think I don't understand you enough?"" She asked, still calm By then I realised I was just being stupid...I kept mute ""No problem, you've asked for it"" she said Gbam. I started apologizing immediately but she gave deaf ears...a part of still wanted the drama to happen so I left her alone after pleading for some time I left for my room and waited for her to come and meet me but she stayed in the living room for almost an hour...

facebook,"October 14 | Saint of the Day ‚ûï POPE SAINT CALLISTUS I Also known as ‚Ä¢ Callixtus I ‚Ä¢ Calixtus I Profile Born a slave, owned by Carpophorus, a Christian in the household of Caesar. His master entrusted a large sum to Callistus to open a bank, which took in several deposits, made several loans to people who refused to pay them back, and went broke. Knowing he would be personally blamed and punished, Callistus fled, but was caught and returned to his owner. Several depositors begged for his life, believing he had not lost the money, but had stolen and hid it. They were wrong; he wasn't a thief, just a victim, but he was sentenced to work the tin mines. By a quirk of Roman law, the ownership of Callistus was transferred from Carpophorus to the state, and when he was later ransomed out of his sentence with a number of other Christians, he became a free man. Pope Zephyrinus put Callistus in charge of the Roman public burial grounds, today still called the Cemetery of Saint Callistus. Archdeacon. Sixteenth Pope. Most of what we know about him has come down to us from his critics, including an anti-Pope of the day. Callistus was on more than one occasion accused of heresy for such actions as permitting a return to Communion for sinners who had repented and done penance, or for proclaiming that differences in economic class were no barrier to marriage. This last put him in conflict with Roman civil law, but he stated that in matters concerning the Church and the sacraments, Church law trumped civil law. In both cases he taught what the Church has taught for centuries, including today, and though a whole host of schismatics wrote against him, his crime seems to have been to practice orthodox Christianity. Martyred in the persecutions of Alexander Severus.

Juan Koen October 13, 2023 We are not called to argue with Christians, Muslims, Atheists or anybody else for that matter about what's currently happening in Israel, nor to choose anybody's side in the natural fight. You want to be on the right side of this, you better choose God's side. The fight does not belong to you, nor me, nor anybody else. The battle belongs to the Lord. We are told to pray for Jerusalem. Not to choose sides. We are called to pray for peace. Matthew 5:9 says Praiseworthy/Fortunate/Happy [blessed] are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Psalms‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠122:6‚Ä¨-8 ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: ‚ÄúMay they prosper who love you. ‚Ä≠ Peace be within your walls, Prosperity within your palaces.‚Äù For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will now say... ‚ÄúPeace be within you.‚Äù Ephesians 6 tells us that our fight is not against flesh and blood. But against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts in heavenly places. The REAL enemy is not only the cause of the current conflict in Israel, but is using the situation in the middle east to stir up strife all around the world. To bring division, and a house divided will not stand. ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠24:6‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨14‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are NOT TROUBLED; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. ‚ÄúThen they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name‚Äôs sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will GROW COLD. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this GOSPEL of the KINGDOM will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. 1. Do not be troubled. Do not be alarmed. Do not partake nor spread the fear in the atmosphere. 2. Fan the flame, ensure you stay on fire for the Messiah. Isaiah 59:17 - the hidden weapon in the armour of God - wrap yourself in the mantle of passion/zeal. 3. First seek the Kingdom of God and all His righteousness. Take up your kingship. Ascend to your throne, son of God, for the kingdom age has come. The Ecclesia is rising. For the Glory of God is risen upon her. Even though the deepest darkness may cover the earth, Nations will be drawn to her rising. And the gates of hell shall not prevail against the onslaught of the Ecclesia. It is a spiritual war that can only be fought in the realms of the spirit. Discern the hour, the season and your destiny in time. For you were born, and called for this moment in time.

facebook,"‚ÄúIdentification with the aggressor‚Äù (or defensive identification) is an unconscious defence mechanism whereby a victim of aggression and suffering (an alienated child) aligns with and behaves like someone (the alienating parent), who is more powerful, hostile, poses a threat, or cannot be overcome. In this way, an alienated child will learn to lie and manipulate as their ‚Äòwinning‚Äô and ‚Äòstronger‚Äô parent does. Alignment and identification with the bully/aggressor also helps to suppress deeper feelings of guilt, vulnerability and shame. It‚Äôs like Stockholm Syndrome when a hostage feels powerless and aligns with their captor. They start to feel gratitude towards the aggressor when they are kind and (conditionally) loving. Deep down, the child/hostage will be aware that their alienating parent isn‚Äôt particularly healthy-minded or loving. The child knows, from experience, this parent is unpredictable, selfish/narcissistic, volatile, they run hot/cold - their parenting involves reward/punishment. The children are parentified, their childhood sacrificed to the adult problems of the alienator, and their reaction to narcissistic wounding as a result of what is usually a high conflict separation or divorce. To love a parent like this the child often will ‚Äòsplit‚Äô in order to cope. To make the alienated parent the villain/baddie is to make their life easier in dealing with the painful experience of alienation, and no longer being allowed to spend time with a loving and loved parent. It‚Äôs to switch off, and totally align with the alienating aggressor. The child is actually afraid of the alienator, and they can partially conquer that fear by becoming more like them, and that pleases the alienator too, which means the child may be less abused. Also, when a child witnesses emotional, psychological (or physical) abuse of a parent, it‚Äôs intimidating, terrifying, confusing, upsetting, and as a survival tactic, they feel that it‚Äôs best for them to be with the terrorising parent, the one it seems unwise to fall out with. There will be consequences. They are afraid and feel they‚Äôve lost one parent and don‚Äôt want to lose the other. What they see their alienating parent is capable of could be turned on them. The child ‚Äòtrauma bonds‚Äô with the parent who poses the biggest threat. This is why the child feels negatively towards the things the alienator/aggressor is negative towards ‚Äì it‚Äôs safer and easier to do so. They forget that their aggressor is really the origin of their suffering. I hope this goes some way to explain the phenomenon of why an alienated child supports, defends, loves and aligns with an abusive, mentally unstable parent while rejecting their more balanced and loving one. #charliemccready #parentalalienation #highconflictcoparenting #rejectedparent #alienatedchild #alienatedparent #parentalalienationischildabuse #narcissisticchildabuse #coercivecontrol #traumabond #traumabondingisnotlove #traumabonding #healingtrauma #custodybattle #highconflictdivorce #divorcesupport #splitting #enmeshment",,246,"{'like_count': 70, 'comment_count': 42, 'num_users': 6386}",Empowering You To Overcome Parental Alienation Behaviors,,2023-10-13 11:10:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/360082093_7068703019810680_5411866649719286884_n.png?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mf8HpJA5obgAX9-BEOG&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMjb8RPoXp92tezZj5D1uHIyHKBEy1GaeB_PZiF71t3A&oe=655B8E98,https://www.facebook.com/groups/3214325232164553/permalink/3493824564214617,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/382802466_7325047374176242_2941187980022768153_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Wlhik2uBKBUAX-RtjWi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAey0NSGcMYUW1DAmYpMe5RUPOAujkyPX5XtzkBNE5hJQ&oe=652ED0A9

facebook,"DAMINI'S GIRLFRIEND CHAPTER TWO As the days went by, tensions began to rise between Ebere and me. It started with a simple disagreement over food and quickly escalated into a full-blown conflict. One evening, I decided to surprise Damini by cooking yam, his favorite meal. I worked diligently in the kitchen, carefully following the recipe and putting my heart into every dish. The aroma filled the house as I set the table, eagerly waiting for Damini to arrive. When Ebere walked into the dining room and saw the food I had prepared, her face contorted with disdain. ""What is this?"" she exclaimed, looking at the dishes with disgust. ""Damini and I can't eat such mediocre food. He deserves better."" My excitement quickly turned to hurt and confusion. I couldn't understand why Ebere would react so harshly. ""But I put a lot of effort into this. It's Damini's favorite,"" I said, my voice trembling with disappointment. Ebere scoffed. ""Well, I don't care. I'll cook something better for him."" Without hesitation, she marched into the kitchen and started preparing her own meal, completely disregarding my efforts. My frustration grew as I watched Ebere take over the kitchen. I approached her, trying to reason with her. ""Ebere, please, let's not fight over this. I made this meal with love for my brother. Can't we enjoy it together?"" But Ebere remained stubborn, her eyes fixed on her own cooking. ""No, I won't settle for your inferior food. Damini deserves the best, and that's what I'll provide."" Not wanting to escalate the issue, I decided to ignore her. I served myself the food I had prepared and went to my room to eat in peace. From that day onwards, I started avoiding Ebere. I didn't want to do anything that would make my brother regret inviting me over for the holidays. However, no matter how much I avoided her, she would always find a way to pick on me. One afternoon, I was peacefully doing my brother's laundry, humming a tune under my breath, when Ebere stormed in with a hostile demeanor. I watched in disbelief as she grabbed the clothes I was washing and carelessly threw them on the floor. ""What are you doing?"" I exclaimed, my voice filled with both shock and anger. ""These clothes are dirty. I'll wash them properly,"" Ebere retorted, her eyes fixed on me with a challenging gaze. I couldn't bear to see my efforts trashed once again. I lunged forward, trying to stop Ebere from damaging the clothes any further. A physical struggle ensued as we fought bitterly, our emotions running high. Damini, alerted by the commotion, rushed to the backyard. Instead of calming the situation, he stood by Ebere's side, blindly supporting his girlfriend without considering the impact of his actions on me. ""That's enough, Nancy!"" Damini's voice boomed. ""Stop causing trouble. Ebere is right. You didn't need to wash my clothes in the first place!"" The words cut deep into my heart. I never expected my own brother to take sides against me, especially when I had done nothing but try to create harmony within the house. Heartbroken and feeling betrayed, I retreated to my room, tears streaming down my face. I immediately picked up my phone and called my mom, telling her I wasn't interested in staying any longer at Damini's house.

facebook,"De oorlog tussen Isra√´l en Palestina dat ons allen diep raakt weegt zwaar. Het is een onderwerp dat met veel geschiedenis en emotie beladen is. Wat ik elke dag opnieuw herhaal is dat elke vorm van geweld en verlies van mensenlevens tragisch is en diep pijn doet. Mijn hart huilt voor alle mensen die lijden binnen dit conflict. Het is dan ook uiterst pijnlijk om zelfs in ons land politici te zien die de vlag hijsen voor enkel 1 kant van het conflict. De enige vlag dat gehezen dient te worden is de witte. De vlag van vrede en het einde aan geweld. Ik geloof in vrede, begrip en mededogen. Het is van belang dat we blijven streven naar een oplossing die rechtvaardig is met prioriteit voor de rechten en waarden van onschuldige mensen. Er worden op dit moment ernstige mensenrechten geschonden die niet onopgemerkt kunnen voorbij gaan. Het afsluiten van water, elektriciteit en blokkeren toevoer van voeding hebben we tussen Rusland en Oekra√Øne zien gebeuren, het herhaalt zich nu in een ander continent en het aantal slachtoffers tellen op. Staatshoofden dienen druk op te voeren om rust in regio te verkrijgen. Het is misschien een droom, maar ik blijf geloven in mijn dromen. We zijn medemensen verplicht samen te werken aan een wereld waarin vrede en harmonie heersen. Waar verschillen worden gevierd en begrepen, en waar iedereen in vrede kan leven, ongeacht hun afkomst. Mijn diepste steun gaat uit naar alle mensen die getroffen zijn door dit conflict, en ik bid voor een toekomst waarin vrede uiteindelijk zal zegevieren.

facebook,"Israel tells civilians to leave Gaza City as military amasses tanks Israel's military on Friday called for all civilians of Gaza City, more than 1 million people, to relocate south within 24 hours, as it amassed tanks ahead of an expected ground invasion after a devastating attack by the militant group Hamas. ""Now is a time for war,"" Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Thursday as Israeli warplanes continued pounding Gaza in retaliation for the weekend attacks by Hamas militants that killed more than 1,300 Israelis, mostly civilians. The Israeli military said it would operate ""significantly"" in Gaza City in coming days and civilians should only return when advised. More than 1,500 Palestinians have already been killed in retaliatory attacks. ""Civilians of Gaza City, evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields,"" the military said. ""Hamas terrorists are hiding in Gaza City inside tunnels underneath houses and inside buildings populated with innocent Gazan civilians."" A Hamas official urged citizens not to fall for what it called ""fake propaganda"". Its military wing later said that 13 among scores of people it captured from Israel had been killed in the latest Israeli air strikes. The Palestinian envoy to Japan accused the Israelis of seeking to completely destroy Gaza while the United Nations said it considered it impossible for such a movement of people to take place ""without devastating humanitarian consequences"". Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, described the U.N. response to Israel's early warning to the residents of Gaza as ""shameful"". Israel has vowed to annihilate the Hamas militant group which led Saturday's attacks and said Hamas tunnels, military compounds, senior operatives' residences and weapons storage warehouses were among 750 military targets struck overnight. A ground invasion of the narrow and densely populated Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people, poses serious risk, with Hamas threatening to kill its hostages. Hours after the Israeli evacuation call, there were no signs people were leaving Gaza City, where dozens gathered at the al-Shifa Hospital, vowing to stay put. Pro-Palestinian protests were expected around the world and the United States and regional leaders planned meetings amid fears that conflict could spread. The U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) said more than 400,000 people had fled their homes in Gaza and 23 aid workers had been killed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said generators at hospitals in Gaza could run out of fuel within hours and the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) warned food and fresh water were running dangerously low. ""The human misery caused by this escalation is abhorrent, and I implore the sides to reduce the suffering of civilians,"" ICRC regional director Fabrizio Carboni said. The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said it had moved its central operations centre and international staff to Gaza's south and urged Israel to spare its shelters.

Partners tungo sa kapayapaan"" These are the words of one of the 90 former rebels who received a P20,000 livelihood settlement grant from DSWD through the Sustainable Livelihood Program in Cotabato Province on October 12, 2023 This grant can be used as seed capital to start new or enhance existing micro-enterprises or purchase the necessary inputs and starter kits for identified micro-enterprises. In his message, Loreto Jr. V. Cabaya, the Director of DSWD XII, emphasized that this provision aims to institutionalize the Whole-of-Nation approach, encouraging a unified national effort to support the country's peace goals in conflict-affected areas and vulnerable communities through collective action. Governor Emmylou ""Lala"" Tali√±o-Mendoza was also present to encourage the former rebels to cooperate with the government. ""Kung nais ninyong patuloy na suportahan kayo ng gobyerno, tulungan ninyo kami na tiyakin na ang mga nasa pamumuno ay hindi konektado sa mga rebeldeng grupo. Magtulungan tayo sa labang ito."" Congresswoman Ma. Alana Samantha Tali√±o-Santos, the 3rd district representative of Cotabato, who graced the event, said, ""Maraming salamat po sa pagbabalik loob, dahil dito binalik niyo rin po ang tiwala at pagmamahal niyo sa Cotabato."" Also present at the event were other partners of DSWD who provided assistance, including the DILG, 39th Infantry Battalion, 72nd Infantry Battalion, 90th Infantry Battalion, and other government officials of Cotabato province. These former rebels were formerly members of CPP-NPA-NDF and their families, Militia ng Bayan and their families, and individuals and families in conflict-affected and vulnerable communities. #BawatBuhayMahalagaSaDSWD #SustainableLivelihoodProgram",,239,"{'like_count': 78, 'comment_count': 25, 'num_users': 187683}",DSWD XII,,2023-10-13 02:08:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/340752294_269773642040955_7897957273747057095_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=YBu1iNhwKeMAX8bquiZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAC_xFJOsklG7Rc9jFfzFfutCaq5unia0N2Wyd4YJkodw&oe=655BA16B,https://www.facebook.com/100069260497757/posts/639245655060779,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387806411_639245308394147_5596715049084034554_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=dR0zYssjjXUAX-32spA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCdSHZz8G-9F-1OP0YvDTtBLaZjjYQ9ud0bTtRW-srLRw&oe=65485F48

We denounce the outbreak of war between Hamas and Israel and call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated settlement of the crisis before it grows and engulfs the region. Posted on October 13, 2023 We are outraged by the attacks launched by Hamas, and the disproportionate response of a declaration of war from Israel. Both have resulted in an immense loss of civilian lives and untold suffering, disproportionately affecting women, children and marginalized groups. We call for the protection of all civilians, the opening of a humanitarian corridor to Gaza, for international law and human rights to be upheld, and women‚Äôs voices to be heard. The context and root causes of the escalating violence must be acknowledged, including the long-standing illegal and inhumane occupation of Palestinian territories and its devastating consequences on the Palestinian people, including displacement, restricted access to basic services, and erosion of human rights. We stand in solidarity with all people affected by the escalating violence. The parties to the conflict, regional actors and the international community have a duty to uphold international law and protect human rights. We issue the following calls to them: 1. Civilians must be protected. Civilians have borne the brunt of the occupation, as well as the violent confrontations between Hamas and Israel. Hamas has targeted and taken civilians hostage, including children. The inhabitants of Gaza currently face a siege. It is a cornerstone of international humanitarian law that civilians must under no circumstances be targeted, and all parties have the utmost duty to protect civilian lives. Therefore: * At this critical time, the international community must continue to call for an end to all hostilities, and the implementation of a ceasefire. * All humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people must be restored, a humanitarian corridor for the transportation of aid and safe passage for civilians must be established and protected. * Governments of the USA, France, Germany, the UK and others, who have expressed unequivocal support for Israel, must make this support conditional on protection of civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories, including provision of basic supplies being immediately returned and the siege lifted. 2. Human rights and international law must be upheld. Deprivation of human rights and basic needs constitutes a war crime. The suspension of power, water, food, and fuel to Gaza by the Israeli authorities amounts to unlawful collective punishment, is unacceptable and disproportionately affects women and children, increasing risk to their physical safety. The taking of hostages by Hamas is unequivocally illicit. Therefore: * The international community must push for the application and implementation of international agreements and laws, including the Geneva Conventions, and all relevant UN General Assembly resolutions, in particular, UNGA resolution 3236, which explicitly recognizes the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. * The international community must push for the immediate release of all hostages and captives. * The international community must strongly condemn and hold accountable states which fuel militarism including those who fund and arm Hamas and other militant groups, notably Iran. * The International Criminal Court and other relevant bodies should conduct a complete inquiry into violations and war crimes that were committed. 3. Women‚Äôs voices must be heard and women‚Äôs rights protected. War and conflict disproportionately affect women, yet women‚Äôs voices are often overlooked and excluded. The Israeli occupation and the Gaza siege have specific gendered impacts that obstruct women's access to basic human rights, social services, and political life, and increase their susceptibility and exposure to gender-based violence. Therefore: * Responses to the escalating conflict must recognize and take into consideration the disproportionate gendered (truncated)",,220,"{'like_count': 159, 'comment_count': 39, 'num_users': 3613568}",ÿ™ŸàŸÉŸÑ ŸÉÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜ Tawakkol Karman,,2023-10-13 16:09:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/385891258_867061618112318_4757136344884959770_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=lDyVKBnxyegAX9RIyqJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDLLsxQpX1SfH1VMA80a2pXG6BR-ioPyRrMzsM4AbVqdA&oe=655B622F,https://www.facebook.com/100044254638024/posts/873190120832801,

facebook,"Israel tells more than 1 million Gazans to relocate within 24 hours Israel's military has called for the immediate relocation of over a million Gaza City residents to the south, in anticipation of a potential ground invasion. This strategic move comes on the heels of a harrowing attack by the militant faction Hamas. The United Nations has voiced grave concerns regarding the feasibility of such a mass evacuation, especially given the dire conditions in Gaza. With dwindling power supplies, and food and water shortages exacerbated by a week of retaliatory air strikes and a full Israeli blockade, the humanitarian situation is nearing a critical point. The international community is on high alert, with top U.S. officials rushing for emergency talks in Israel. The geopolitical ripples of this conflict have reached as far as Iran, which has issued warnings of potential retaliatory actions from its allies, including Hamas and Hezbollah. Pro-Palestinian protests are gaining momentum globally, sparking fears within some Jewish communities of potential retaliatory attacks, especially in light of the recent assault by Hamas inside Israel that claimed over 1,300 lives, predominantly civilians. In a show of defiance against the Israeli directive, Muntadhar Kareem, a 25-year-old teacher from Baghdad, rallied with thousands, declaring, ""We are ready to join the fight and rid the Palestinians of the Israeli atrocities."" The Israeli military's announcement was punctuated by a stern warning to Gaza City's civilians, cautioning them against the potential human shield tactics employed by Hamas militants. Despite these warnings, the morning saw little movement from the city's residents, with many dismissing the evacuation call as ""fake propaganda."" Palestinian representatives abroad are sounding alarms over what they perceive as Israel's intent to obliterate Gaza. The enclave, housing over 1.5 million Palestinians, many of whom are descendants of refugees from Israel's 1948 inception, has already seen a death toll surpassing 1,500 in the current conflict. Israel remains resolute in its stance, citing the recent gruesome attack on its civilians as a justifiable pretext for its aggressive measures against Hamas. The nation's military reported overnight strikes on over 750 militant targets, including weapons caches and tunnels. As diplomatic efforts gain momentum, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other global leaders converging on the region, the situation remains precariously balanced. Blinken condemned the violence, urging restraint while reiterating U.S. support for Israel. Security concerns are prompting swift actions worldwide, with countries like the U.S. and Japan offering evacuation flights for their nationals in Israel. Jewish institutions in various cities have heightened security measures in response to potential threats. The conflict, now shining a spotlight on the long-standing grievances of Gazans who have endured economic hardships and recurrent Israeli strikes, has reignited discussions on the broader Palestinian struggle.

But no matter what your background, experience or character, everyone has the potential to become a great leader provided they take the right steps to build confidence and hone their skills. That includes building the TOP 5 C's of effective leadership. In this guid I'm going to carefully walk you through this five Cs that will enable you to become not just and effective but one that will drive results in your organization, industry or workplace. Let's take a look. 1.ùóñùóºùó∫ùó∫ùòÇùóªùó∂ùó∞ùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª Being a good leader requires excellent communication skills, this means possessing the ability to listen to people as well as the ability to share ideas. These skills also relate to the capacity to negotiate when necessary and manage issues of conflict. To become a great leader, you must be able to communicate with people in a variety of situations; and not only communicate but communicate well. Effective leaders share ideas with their team as well as listen to what their teams have to say, aware of the importance of building relationships with colleagues. They create a bond of trust, showing interest in their team‚Äôs professional and personal goals. 2.ùóñùóºùóªùó≥ùó∂ùó±ùó≤ùóªùó∞ùó≤ To be an effective leader, you will need to display confidence. You can demonstrate this trait through both the way you conduct yourself and your actions. It‚Äôs important to be aware that being confident does not mean being brash and pushy. Rather, you can display it through more subtle actions, like being decisive and having faith in your abilities. Faith. Effective leaders have faith in themselves, believing in their abilities. When people believe in themselves, those surrounding will also believe it. A leader is someone who uses their best judgment and is confident when making decisions. 3.ùóñùóºùó∫ùó∫ùó∂ùòÅùó∫ùó≤ùóªùòÅ Demonstrating commitment to the cause or organisation you are working for will create goodwill and overall positive outcomes. Showing commitment to those around you also contributes to good relationships and, in turn, can inspire similar commitment at every level of the organisation. Commitment is among the most difficult ‚ÄúC‚Äôs‚Äù to embody as a leader. It relies on a principled, resolute approach, wherein all avenues have been explored and all ideas investigated. It also requires a good degree of self-confidence, and a belief that your approach is best for the outcome of the wider business or project of the organization. 4.ùóñùóøùó≤ùóÆùòÅùó∂ùòÉùó∂ùòÅùòÜ The best leaders are often those who can think in a creative, innovative way. If you find it hard to look at situations from different perspectives, you will find it more of a challenge to lead since leaders need to be able to look at the big picture. Being creative will also help when it comes to problem-solving and making decisions. Leaders must be quick on their toes, able to adapt to a variety of situations. A leader can make magic happen by thinking outside of the box. Of course, not everyone is naturally gifted with creativity‚Ä¶ The good news is that it is possible to enhance creativity by training the way you think. 5.ùóñùóÆùóøùó≤ Exceptional leaders are empathetic, caring for their people, not just the work they do. People want to feel valued. They want meaningful connection at work. As a leader make sure you ask them about their life. WhaHow is their family doing? Did they find time to relax on them. Work isn‚Äôt everything, and your people will develop loyalty only when you care about them as people, not as productivity generators. In conclusion Effective leaders are wise, nurturing, and take fate into their own hands. They mentor those around them and can bring the wildest dreams to fruition. Some people are natural-born leaders, while others don‚Äôt have that luxury. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum, everyone has room to improve their leadership skills and can become an effective leader with enough faith and determination. We are here to help you build and nurture your leadership skills. Follow me for more leadership development, personal growth, and high-performance business management!

facebook,"From: I‚Äôm Going to War for Israel. Palestinians Are Not My Enemy. By Nir Avishai Cohen (Mr. Cohen, a major in the reserves of the Israel Defense Forces, is the author of the book ‚ÄúLove Israel, Support Palestine.‚Äù) https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/israel-military-war.html I was in Austin, Texas, for work on Saturday when I received a call from my commander in the Israel Defense Forces to return to Israel and head to the front line. I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I knew that the citizens of my country were in real danger. My duty first and foremost is to join the fight against those who unleashed a massacre on my people. I boarded the first flight I found out of Austin to head home to join the I.D.F. reserves, where I serve as a brigade operations command officer. During my long flight to Israel, my mind couldn‚Äôt rest. I was trying to write down my feelings and thoughts about everything happening ‚Äî and everything that‚Äôs about to happen ‚Äî in my beloved country. Little by little, the dimensions of the horrors of the most brutal attack that Israelis have experienced since the establishment of the state were being revealed. Hundreds of Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,200 people, including women, children and older people. About 150 citizens and soldiers have been taken captive. There‚Äôs nothing in the world that can justify the murder of hundreds of innocent people. But I‚Äôd like to say one thing clearly, before I go to battle: There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúunavoidable.‚Äù This war could have been avoided, and no one did enough to prevent it. Israel did not do enough to make peace; we just conquered the Palestinian territories in the West Bank, expanded the illegal settlements and imposed a long-term siege on the Gaza Strip. For 56 years Israel has been subjecting Palestinians to oppressive military rule. In my book ‚ÄúLove Israel, Support Palestine,‚Äù I wrote: ‚ÄúIsraeli society has to ask itself very important questions about where and why the blood of its sons and daughters was spilled. A Messianic religious minority has dragged us into a muddy swamp, and we are following them as if it were the Piper from Hamelin.‚Äù When I wrote these words last year, I didn‚Äôt realize how deep in the mud we were, and how much more blood could be shed in so little time. I am now going to defend my country against enemies who want to kill my people. Our enemies are the deadly terrorist organizations that are being controlled by Islamic extremists. Palestinians aren‚Äôt the enemy. The millions of Palestinians who live right here next to us, between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan, are not our enemy. Just like the majority of Israelis want to live a calm, peaceful and dignified life, so do Palestinians. Israelis and Palestinians alike have been in the grip of a religious minority for decades. On both sides, the intractable positions of a small group have dragged us into violence. It doesn‚Äôt matter who is more cruel, or more ruthless. The ideology of both have fueled this conflict, leading to the death of too many innocent civilians. As a major in the reserves, it is important to me to make it clear that in this already unstoppable new war, we cannot allow the massacre of innocent Israelis to result in the massacre of innocent Palestinians. Israel must remember that there are more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip. The vast majority of them are innocent. Israel must do everything in its power to avoid killing innocent people, and focus on destroying the militant army of Hamas. This war, like others before it, will end sooner or later. I am not sure I will come back from it alive, but I do know that a minute after the war is over, both Israelis and Palestinians will have to reckon with the leaders who led them to this moment. We must wake up and not let the extremists rule. Palestinians and Israelis must denounce the extremists who are driven by religious fanaticism. The Israelis will have to oust National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and their far-right circle from power, and the Palestinians will have to oust the leadership of Hamas. I try to look for shreds of hope. The Yom Kippur War, the most difficult war that Israel had known until this week, started by surprise in 1973. After a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt was finally signed in 1979, the border with Egypt ‚Äî one that was once the site of the dead and wounded ‚Äî became a border of peace. Israelis must realize that there is no greater security asset than peace. The strongest army cannot protect the country the way peace does. This current war proves it once again. Israel has followed the path of war for too long. At the end, after all of the dead Israelis and Palestinians are buried, after we have finished washing away the rivers of blood, the people who share a home in this land will have to understand that there is no other choice but to follow the path of peace. That is where true victory lies.",,204,"{'like_count': 94, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 408590}",Main St Democrats,,2023-10-13 18:57:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/297103115_422868096533359_938684714250560762_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=d0GnbUxnsj8AX9vWKG6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAC7kK2NuHcP5xpf_jykvK-fFhBKFYysP5mhHAbky7paQ&oe=655A7DA2,https://www.facebook.com/100064305177135/posts/717508663735966,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387090774_717507883736044_889628415976821470_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=suZc_Q0FThUAX-9_sXT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBkL6WUSq6S77TcQLk6pvbQegO56vhs1o08cUjbkEYvTw&oe=655A415A

facebook,"Human Rights Watch has unequivocally confirmed the use of white phosphorus by Israeli forces during military operations in Lebanon and Gaza on October 10 and 11, 2023. Verified through video evidence and witness accounts, the footage portrays numerous artillery-fired white phosphorus airbursts, observed over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border. White phosphorus, known for its dual use as a smokescreen or a weapon, carries significant risks for civilians due to the severe burns it inflicts and its enduring, detrimental impact on survivors. Its deployment in densely populated regions of Gaza represents a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, mandating conflict parties to take all possible precautions to prevent harm to civilians. Moreover, this distressing revelation underscores the imperative to critically review the adequacy and standing of Protocol III of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), the sole international legislation dedicated to regulating incendiary weapons.

instagram,"The past week has shown humanity at its worst: A horrific terrorist attack left at least 1,300 Israelis dead, among them peace activists and even innocent children. The fates of many more kidnapped civilians still lie in the balance. Meanwhile, statements from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggest retaliation against Palestinians in Gaza will be swift and merciless. More than 1,500 Gazans are already dead, and 338,000 others have been displaced. In moments of turmoil such as this, some believe it is the responsibility of a newspaper of record like The Onion to delve fully into the nuances of a complex and multifaceted conflict that stretches back not just decades but centuries. These people are wrong.‚Å†

instagram,"At a time when Indian media is more concerned about Israel-Palestine conflict than Manipur violence, the Manipur government has banned the circulation of videos and photos of violence that hit the northeast state in May.

The directive comes just days after a video, purportedly showing a man being burnt, had surfaced on social media, triggering fresh outrage and condemnation. The police had said that the video was related to the May 4 strip-parade case which the CBI is probing.

Grappling with frequent tension following sharing of videos and photographs, the govt said its a ""positive step"" towards bringing normalcy to the conflict-hit state.

An order by the Governor issued through the state Home Department on Wednesday stated that the state government took circulating images of violent activities ‚Äúvery seriously and with utmost sensitivity.‚Äù It stated that images of activities such as inflicting bodily harm and damage to public or private property are likely to facilitate the mobilisation of ‚Äúmobs of agitators and demonstrators,‚Äù aggravating the law and order situation in the state. 

 It went on to say that anyone in possession of such images should approach the nearest Superintendent of Police and submit them for legal action, but if they are found to be circulating such images through social media, they shall be booked and prosecuted ‚Äúunder relevant provision of the law of land.‚Äù It also stated that those found ‚Äúmisusing technology for inciting violence/hatred‚Äù will be dealt with under provisions of the IT Act and the IPC.

Mobile internet services were again suspended in the state till October 16.

instagram,"‚ÄúWhere is humanity?‚Äù

The images above show only some of the horror, suffering and grief that has unfolded this week, as the latest brutal conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas continues to claim victims.

More than 1,300 people have been killed in Israel, according to the military. More than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed and a further 6,612 wounded by Israeli strikes since Saturday, Gaza‚Äôs health ministry said on Thursday.¬†

The UN‚Äôs human rights office has called for restraint on both sides. However, with nearly half of Gaza‚Äôs 2.3 million citizens warned by Israel to evacuate before a likely ground assault ‚Äì an order the UN says will spark 'devastating humanitarian consequences' ‚Äì the tragedy of the last week looks unlikely to end soon.

‚ÄúI want [my family] back ‚Ä¶ want to close my eyes and this was all a nightmare,‚Äù says Yifat Zailer, who has six family members still missing after Hamas‚Äôs attack

‚ÄúForget Islam, Christianity and Judaism, where is humanity?‚Äù said Gaza resident Oummah Thahir, a mother of six.

instagram,"Israel has told civilians - about 1.1 million people - to flee northern Gaza.

The UN called on Israel to withdraw the order, warning of ""devastating humanitarian consequences"".

Israel has massed hundreds of thousands of soldiers ahead of an expected ground offensive. 

Hamas kidnapped at least 150 people and took them into Gaza during deadly attacks on Israel at the weekend that killed 1,300 people.

The Gaza Strip - home to roughly 2.2 million people, and just 41km long and 10km-wide - is one of the most densely populated places on earth.

A shadow fell over In Cream Cat Island, as escalating religious conflicts unearthed hidden factions of violence. Leaders of these organizations, kept in the shadows for years, were now emerging, adding to the island's tumultuous state. The majority of the victims were innocent civilians, their lives disrupted by the unrest. This was more than a conflict; it was a test of resilience for the island's peaceful inhabitants. In a world filled with cream-like warmth, the upheaval was a chilling reminder of the delicate balance of peace, leaving many cats on the island in a state of worry.

instagram,"World News:
Human Rights Watch (HRW) has alleged that Israel used white phosphorus in its recent military strikes in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border.

On October 10th and 11th, HRW researchers claimed to have verified the use of white phosphorus, highlighting videos that reportedly depict ""multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus"" both over Gaza's port and in areas close to the Israel-Lebanon boundary. 

Another view:
Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an IDF spokesperson, said, ""The current accusation made against the IDF regarding the use of white phosphorus in Gaza is unequivocally false.""

The substance, which can cause significant burns and ignite structures, has been a point of contention among human rights advocates, even though it's not typically labeled a chemical weapon. HRW's Middle East and North Africa director, Lama Fakih, expressed concerns, noting that ""any time that white phosphorus is used in crowded civilian areas, it poses a high risk of excruciating burns and lifelong suffering.""

Latest death toll numbers:
IDF reports: 1,300 dead, 3,000 wounded
Gaza Ministry of Health: 1,799 dead, 7,388 wounded.

Attached is the image Human Rights Watch released as evidence, along with a video (swipe).

instagram,"The ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel which escalated after the Hamas terrorists entered into the Jewish nation and mercilessly massacred citizens including the elderly, women and babies has found support from Islamists worldwide. Notably, the extremists in India are not far behind either. They are rejoicing in the bloodshed in Israel and desire to perpetuate similar atrocities against Hindus in India. They are repeatedly making genocidal calls to provoke their co-religionists into murdering Hindus.

Arif Nashriyaat from Rajasthan who calls himself a ‚Äòpublic figure‚Äô has also joined the chorus and is baiting for the blood of the Hindus. He has around 92 thousand followers on Instagram and more than thirty-five thousand subscribers on YouTube and often indoctrinates his audience to pick up weapons for the cause of jihad. He has claimed that he is ‚Äòdismantling the batil‚Äô (falsehood according to Islam) in the biography of his account which also contains other Islamic messages.

The influencer uses anecdotes from Islamic mythology to threaten and provoke violence against Hindus. In one of his recent videos, he alleged, ‚ÄúThe Sanghis who slaughtered Iqbal, Nasir, Junaid, Waris, and Tabreez and murdered Muslims in buses, markets, mosques, forests, and prisons, I want to warn them to kill as many Muslims as they want like animals, but to keep in mind that when the slave of the Prophet Muhammad screams, it will move mountains.‚Äù

instagram,"Almost 70 percent of registered voters side with Israelis over Palestinians, although support for Palestine increases among younger generations, according to a portion of a Fox News poll conducted during and after Hamas‚Äôs terrorist attacks on Israel last weekend. 

The poll, published Wednesday, asked voters, ‚ÄúIn the Middle East conflict, do you side more with the Israelis or more with the Palestinians?‚Äù

The results show that 68 percent of Americans support Israelis versus just 18 percent who support Palestinians. Majorities in both major political parties back Israel, but support among Republicans is more potent than Democrats. 

Per the poll, jointly conducted by Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research, 59 percent of Democrats support Israel, as do 79 percent of Republicans. Conversely, one in four Democrats back Palestine, while just over one in ten Republicans side with Palestine. 

Support for Israel has jumped nine percentage points since a May 2021 Fox News poll. Back then, 59 percent of Americans sided with Israelis versus 24 percent who backed Palestinians. This marks a fifteen-point swing in public opinion in two-and-a-half years.

‚ÄúThe main reason for the overall increase in support for Israel is Democrats have dramatically changed their position,‚Äù Republican pollster Daron Shaw told Fox News. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve moved from +7 Israel to +34, which undoubtedly reflects revulsion over the nature of the attacks.‚Äù

A trend evident among age demographics in the current poll shows younger Americans are more inclined to support Palestine than their older counterparts. For instance, among survey respondents under 35, 49 percent back Israel, whereas 34 percent moreso side with Palestine. 

A majority of 55 percent of those 44 and younger side with Israelis. Less than one in three respondents in the demographic says they back Palestinians. 

Among those 45 and older, support for Israel grows dramatically to 76 percent, while support for Palestine shrinks to 9 percent.

The sample included 1,007 registered voters who were surveyed between October 7-9.

instagram,"World News:
French authorities have banned all pro-Palestine demonstrations, citing ""increased antisemitic incidents"" within the country. This comes as France is home to Europe's most substantial Jewish community of around 500,000 and one of its largest Muslim populations, estimated at 5 million. 

Since the conflict broke out between Israel and Hamas, French Interior Minister G√©rald Darmanin informed a local radio station that the country had witnessed 100 antisemitic incidents ranging from graffiti depicting swastikas and messages like ""death to Jews"" to more severe cases where individuals were apprehended trying to bring knives into educational institutions and places of worship. In light of these events, Darmanin announced plans to enhance security around Jewish landmarks such as schools and synagogues. He also announced that foreigners violating the protest ban would face ""systematic"" expulsion from the country. 

Despite the ban on pro-Palestinian protests, people continue to show up in sizable numbers to protest, prompting police intervention with tear gas and water cannons to end the protests. 

Protestors echoed sentiments like ""Israel murderer"" and ""Macron accomplice,"" alluding to Macron's denunciation of Hamas and his backing of Israel.

instagram,"Mia Khalifa was recently fired by Playboy after she expressed her views on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Playboy announced the termination of Mia in an email to its subscribers, citing her comments which they deemed ""disgusting and reprehensible"" for supporting Palestinians in the conflict. The adult company referred to its zero-tolerance policy towards hate speech and stated that they have removed Mia's Playboy channel from their content platform. 

Although Mia has faced a lot of flak and hate speech for her support of Palestine, she has remained steadfast in her stance, even referring to Playboy as 'zionist' in her statement.

instagram,"Last weekend's unprecedented Hamas attack and Israel‚Äôs response are taking a heavy human toll. As the tragedy unfolds, a global economic downturn may follow.

Of course, secondary effects like these aren‚Äôt top of mind after the past week‚Äôs human tragedy, with civilians accounting for a large majority of the dead on both sides. As Israel‚Äôs army prepares to invade Gaza in response to the assault by the militant group, there‚Äôs concern that militias in Lebanon and Syria that support Hamas will join the fighting.

Like Middle East wars of the past, the conflict has the potential to disrupt the world economy ‚Äî and even tip it into recession if more countries are drawn in. Bloomberg Economics has created three scenarios that examine the likely impact of war on the global economy. Tap the link in our bio to see their analysis.

instagram,"Amid the ongoing conflict and the strained geopolitics of the Middle East, I'm reminded of my experiences serving in various disaster-stricken and war-torn regions. One crucial lesson I've learned is that when the dust settles, the true victims are often innocent people, regardless of which side they were on. The human suffering, the loss, the pain‚Äîthey don't discriminate.

It's not about taking sides; it's about recognizing our shared humanity. I've seen the tears, the anguish, and the resilience of people who yearn for peace and a chance at a better life. Regardless of where we come from, our dreams, our hopes, and our families are interconnected by our common desire for a safer, more peaceful world.

It's not about politics; it's about compassion, kindness, and the pursuit of a better future. Together, we can stand for unity, for healing, and for a brighter tomorrow. üïäÔ∏èü§ù

instagram,"Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican‚Äôs secretary of state, condemned Hamas‚Äô Saturday terrorist attacks against Israel, called for peace in the Holy Land, and said the Vatican is ready to help mediate a peace agreement, in an interview published by Vatican News Friday.‚Å£
‚Å£
Parolin told Vatican News that the Hamas attacks were ‚Äúinhuman,‚Äù and that the Holy See expresses ‚Äúcomplete and firm condemnation.‚Äù ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúWe express our solidarity with the affected families, the vast majority of whom are Jewish,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe pray for them, for those still in shock, for the wounded.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
He also expressed the Vatican‚Äôs concern for the civilians in Gaza and the ‚Äúmen, women, children, and the elderly held hostage.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
It is necessary,‚Äù Parolin said, ‚Äúto regain a sense of reason, abandon the blind logic of hatred, and reject violence as a solution. It is the right of those who are attacked to defend themselves, but even legitimate defense must respect the parameter of proportionality.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
Parolin said that the Vatican‚Äôs chief concern amid the conflict is ‚Äúthe release of Israeli hostages and the protection of innocent lives in Gaza.‚Äù ‚Å£
‚Å£
He posited that these two concerns are a matter of ‚Äújustice.‚Äù ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúIt is just ‚Äî indeed, essential ‚Äî that in this conflict, as in any other, humanitarian law be fully respected,‚Äù he said. ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúIt is just for the hostages to be returned immediately, even those held by Hamas since previous conflicts,‚Äù Parolin said, adding that it is also ‚Äújust that in Israel's legitimate defense, the lives of Palestinian civilians living in Gaza should not be endangered.‚Äù ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúI do not know how much room for dialogue there can be between Israel and the Hamas militia,‚Äù Parolin said. ‚ÄúBut if there is ‚Äî and we hope there is ‚Äî it should be pursued immediately and without delay.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
He said that the Holy See is ‚Äúready for any necessary mediation.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúThe greatest possible justice in the Holy Land,‚Äù Parolin claimed, ‚Äúis the two-state solution, which would allow Palestinians and Israelis to live side by side in peace and security, meeting the aspirations of the majority.‚Äù‚Å£

The Delhi Police has also beefed up security around the Israeli embassy and Chabad House located in Chandni Chowk in central Delhi in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict, an official said.

The officer added that authorities have directed to increase the vigil around both installations.

""Security has been also beefed up at the Chabad House (Jewish prayer house) and other parts of Delhi as well. Security arrangements have been made wherever there are Jewish establishments,"" the officer said.

On Thursday, the Delhi Police also carried out a late-night patrol around the Jama Masjid in the walled city area.

Video clips shared on social media showed a squad of bike-borne police personnel patrolling the Jama Masjid area, followed by another group of policemen on foot patrol.

According to officials, the patrolling is part of an ""institutionalised mechanism"" conducted by Delhi Police from time to time.

Delhi Police said the exercise was conducted in the wake of certain ""inputs"" they received amid the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza.

Delhi Police has also urged Muslim community members to offer namaz at mosques in their areas of residence and not venture elsewhere to offer prayers.

While the nature of the current ""inputs"" the Delhi Police have received is unknown, it should be noted that Israeli and Jewish establishments in India have been targeted by terrorists in the past.",,7313,"{'like_count': 7241, 'comment_count': 72, 'num_users': 783490}",Indiatimes,,2023-10-13 12:00:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/370572795_289657980337985_3572264800135278624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=L3zIpLG0fIYAX9vxNfY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAFMA5_YaL8ry2cr4nUwUFbJ7y6wn8sLSjnNDA_oBUPiA&oe=655ADEE1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyVpYHhhheE/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391511954_656808503223413_7306593130203446468_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=oTfW31PGBsIAX_etf8f&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD9kL1k3mWi8DCOsQs_71nOK5DQVZaDJb7Td193rfkMIQ&oe=6531EFC0
instagram,"‚ÄòWhere is humanity?‚Äô

The images above show only some of the horror, suffering and grief that has unfolded this week, as the latest brutal conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas continues to claim victims.

More than 1,300 people have been killed in Israel, according to the military. More than 1,799 Palestinians have been killed and a further 6,388 wounded by Israeli strikes since Saturday, Gaza‚Äôs health ministry said on Friday.

The UN‚Äôs human rights office has called for restraint on both sides. However, with nearly half Gaza‚Äôs 2.3 million citizens warned by Israel to evacuate before a likely ground assault ‚Äì an order the UN says will spark 'devastating humanitarian consequences' ‚Äì the tragedy of the last week looks unlikely to end soon.

‚ÄúI want [my family] back ‚Ä¶ want to close my eyes and this was all a nightmare,‚Äù says Yifat Zailer, who has six family members still missing after Hamas‚Äôs attack

‚ÄúForget Islam, Christianity and Judaism, where is humanity?‚Äù said Gaza resident Oummah Thahir, a mother of six.

instagram,"I am speechless, numb and paralyzed by the indescribable pain, agony, destruction, and lack of humanity. It‚Äôs unconscionable how people are able to justify, endorse, support, and celebrate the mass murder that is wiping out entire generations of families, violation of basic human rights, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, the illegal siege and blockade of 2.3 million people. 

As a mother of a young toddler, hearing the wails and screams of the parents holding the bodies of their children killed by airstrikes, putting them on their chest so they can feel their hearts, wishing they were killed with them because how does one survive or overcome this inhumane suffering and grief, has broken me. This is not new for the people of Palestine, this is not a unique experience, this is their constant generational trauma experience living under Apartheid. 

How much longer will the world continue to turn a blind eye to this collective and inhumane punishment?

instagram,"Human Rights Watch has determined based on verified video and witness accounts that Israeli forces used white phosphorus in military operations in Lebanon and Gaza on October 10 and 11, 2023, respectively. The videos show multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border.

White phosphorus, which can be used as a smokescreen or a weapon, has the potential to cause civilian harm due to the severe burns it causes and its lingering long-term effects on survivors. Its use in densely populated areas of Gaza violates the requirement under international humanitarian law that parties to the conflict take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life.

This evacuation would result in almost half of Gaza's population being displaced, causing alarm at the U.N. due to its catastrophic implications. 

Hamas, having launched an attack on Israel a week earlier, views this evacuation order as a tactic and urges residents to remain. Meanwhile, the tension has resulted in panic and confusion among civilians who are also coping with Israel's blockade of food, water, and supplies. The escalating conflict has seen over 3,000 casualties, and fears of broader regional turmoil are rising.

instagram,"POLITICO: U.S. Secretary Of State Antony Blinken Warned U.S. Lawmakers Azerbaijan May Invade Armenia In Coming Weeks
‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned a small group of U.S. lawmakers during a phone call on October 3, 2023, that his department is tracking the possibility that Azerbaijan could soon invade Armenia, reports POLITICO citing two people familiar with the conversation.

During the call, U.S. lawmakers pressed Blinken on possible measures against Aliyev in response to Azerbaijan‚Äôs attack on Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) in September, said the people who were granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive call.

Blinken responded that the State Department was looking at avenues to hold Azerbaijan accountable & isn‚Äôt planning to renew a long-standing waiver that allows the U.S. to provide military assistance to Baku. He said the State Dept. saw a possibility that Azerbaijan would invade southern Armenia in the coming weeks.

Azerbaijan‚Äôs President Ilham Aliyev has been calling on Armenia to open a ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù along its southern border, linking mainland Azerbaijan to its Nakhichevan exclave that borders Turkey & Iran. The ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù would cut through Armenia‚Äôs southern Syunik region to enable road traffic to bypass Iran.

Aliyev has threatened to solve the issue ‚Äúby force‚Äù & said, ‚ÄúWe will be implementing the Zangezur Corridor, whether Armenia wants it or not.‚Äù

Still, Blinken expressed confidence about ongoing diplomatic talks between Armenia & Azerbaijan to the Democratic lawmakers, including Reps‚ÄîNancy Pelosi & Anna Eshoo of California, & Frank Pallone of New Jersey.

In a statement, the State Dept. declined to comment on the call but emphasized the department‚Äôs commitment to ‚ÄúArmenia‚Äôs sovereignty & territorial integrity‚Äù & resolving conflict through ‚Äúdirect talks.‚Äù

Every year since 2002, the U.S. has issued the waiver, allowing it to sidestep a provision of the Freedom Support Act that bars the U.S. from providing military assistance to Azerbaijan in light of its ongoing territorial disputes with Armenia. The waiver lapsed in June & the State Dept. had previously provided no explanation as to why it hadn‚Äôt yet requested a renewal.",,5662,"{'like_count': 5420, 'comment_count': 242, 'num_users': 152020}",Zartonk Media,,2023-10-13 22:04:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/179591958_127339859442677_2578100400292612687_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=hkSQD6TQFA4AX-vpXoe&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCWrfSj4qWU0ER_cqFd6KwMMh8SR3BOanlwI156lQ_FeQ&oe=655A0ADE,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWucigJ8Lu/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391293686_864161278512789_4161240873055975815_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=UC61gHAYko8AX_I_Bze&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDc5G1Kp7VEX_rDTWNtF_WRNUOctsBqfn-u2Y3ByMojyw&oe=6559D731

The Red Nation stands with Palestinians in their struggle for decolonization and land back

....

As we write this, Palestinians face unrelenting and unprecedented settler violence. The Israeli army has warned 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza to relocate south within the next twenty-four hours as Israel prepares to level Gaza with bombs.‚Äã‚ÄãThe Israeli apartheid regime has already cut off all food, water, and electricity to Gaza while carpet bombing residential buildings, markets, schools, health facilities, and mosques. Across the occupied West Bank residents fear the worst, with many trapped in their homes as armed Israeli settlers threaten pogroms against Palestinian families and the military prohibits any freedom of movement. Israeli officials promise to ‚Äúopen the gates of hell,‚Äù labeling Palestinians ‚Äúhuman animals.‚Äù 

Israeli-led massacres in Gaza have commenced with full support and aid from the US.

For the last two decades, 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in a dense open-air prison, besieged by Israel in violation of international law. Two thirds of the population in Gaza are refugees that were forcibly displaced from other parts of Palestine. Half the population are children, and the vast majority are impoverished. Completely surrounded by a militarized barrier, Gazans are denied freedom of movement and regular access to food, water, and healthcare by a protracted Israeli siege. In 2018, the United Nations deemed Gaza ‚Äúunlivable,‚Äù and since then Gazans have experienced multiple bombardments by Israel, intensifying an already untenable situation.

This is not a ‚Äúconflict.‚Äù This is a deliberate act of settler colonialism and genocide.

Israel‚Äôs violent occupation of historic Palestine is typically framed as a ‚Äúconflict.‚Äù This is a distortion of history that erases the actual truth: Israel cannot exist without the annihilation of Palestinians, whether this be slow or sudden. (continued in comments)

instagram,"‚ÄúThis week will almost certainly be remembered by Jewish Americans as one of the most difficult in our collective modern memory,‚Äù writes Vox senior correspondent Marin Cogan. ‚ÄúThere is the primary grief, over the loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives, and the terrible knowledge that, with Israel waging a counterattack on Gaza, these deaths will continue.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmerican Jews are not a monolith. We are a tight-knit but diverse community, made up of people from different races, denominations, and political beliefs. We are used to finding comfort and support in each other. Even so, we are also discovering how deeply isolating this moment can feel, as we struggle to make sense of a rapidly unfolding tragedy, our own sense of loss, and how that heartbreak is being received by the outside world.‚Äù

‚ÄúNone of this is happening in a vacuum. It‚Äôs coming amid seismic shifts in politics and public opinion, during a right-wing turn in Israel‚Äôs government and an ever-longer violent occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, as well as broader generational changes, with a younger generation of Jewish Americans who are more progressive and more willing to be critical of Israel.‚Äù

Explore these shifting attitudes, and the complicated questions they raise for American Jews in an already cataclysmic moment, by reading the full piece at the link in our bio.

instagram,"Israel‚Äôs military on Friday directed the evacuation of northern Gaza, a region that is home to 1.1 million people ‚Äî about half of the territory's population ‚Äî within 24 hours, a UN spokesman said.‚Å£
This could signal an impending ground offensive, though the Israeli military has not yet confirmed such an appeal. On Thursday it said that while it was preparing, a decision has not yet been made.

The order, delivered to the UN, comes as Israel presses an offensive against Hamas militants. UN spokesman St√©phane Dujarric called the order ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù without ‚Äúdevastating humanitarian consequences.‚Äù

Why it matters: Bush, calling himself ""kind of a hardliner,"" said out loud what other leaders won't - that he believes there'll be a temptation for the public to buckle and think peace is an option.

Flashback: Bush endorsed Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's disengagement from Gaza in 2005 as a positive step toward peace.

Bush also supported the 2006 Palestinian elections, which Hamas won before seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 - setting the conditions for many of the conflict's current dynamics.

Over the weekend, the George W. Bush Institute, which speaks for the former president, issued a statement strongly condemning ""the heinous terrorist attacks on Israel.""",,4335,"{'like_count': 3944, 'comment_count': 391, 'num_users': 220480}",Axios,,2023-10-13 15:37:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/338301122_245222514620481_4813814425348324627_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NymoQ-lHg2AAX_SDR-g&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCp335WZ2IeckwFkZs2-2ySyCDquM-DpMx2laipH64RkA&oe=655A9A4B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWCJ8LrnDW/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391371619_247079991291893_3068750916320367314_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=qHOc2ccO5aMAX8W-aRy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBOmtCBMMLU7vIyjEFGYfj5Y1pFUYoeOdxh8_uh9UsvNQ&oe=653E44B0

This is laying the groundwork for mass civilian death with official US government support. It supports imposition by the Netanyahu government of collective punishment on civilians in violation of the laws of war, and potentially will lead to the ""cleansing"" of Gaza which always has been the wish of religious extremists in the country fighting for a ""Greater Israel"" in which Palestinians and non-Jews will be treated as second-class citizens as part of an apartheid system of governance. This latter point has been confirmed by prominent human rights groups all over the world, including those within Israel.

To be clear, the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians are absolutely indefensible. I condemn them and all attacks on civilians absolutely. But the actions of Hamas combatants no matter how heinous cannot be used to justify the deliberately indiscriminate bombing by Israel of civilians in Gaza, the population of which is 50% children. Thousands of additional Palestinian children are about to die in plain sight with the backing and funding of the US government and the active encouragement of our President.

As a US citizen, I dissent. As a Jew, I am repulsed that this is being done in the name of our people.

Days ago I criticized President Biden for not calling for a ceasefire and for giving an extremist Israeli government a blank check to retaliate. War crimes are now being committed with his open support and our tax dollars. And now we learn that the US government is ordering all diplomats around the world to stay away from even using the word ceasefire -- a word to describe a process that might put pause to the madness and bloodletting.

instagram,"New Delhi: Israel‚Äôs army has said that all the people living in northern Gaza must move to the southern region within the next 24 hours, the United Nations has said. This indicates that a massive ground invasion may be on the cards.

Israel has been bombing the isolated coastal strip in retaliation to Hamas‚Äô attacks, which began on October 7. Thousands have died in the escalation of the conflict, that has seen severely polarised reactions from global leaders.

The Israeli air force has dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza since October 7, it has announced on X.

Already, the UN has announced that no aid has been able to come in from the outside of the Gaza Strip for its 2.3 million residents. There is a water crisis, no food and no electricity as Israel has blocked access to such essentials in a move that has been called ‚Äúinhuman, violent and brutal‚Äù and a distinct war crime. In addition, the Human Rights Watch has reported that white phosphorus is being used by Israel on the Gaza Strip. It is used for signalling, obscuring, or to set fires but can severely burn people and set structures on fire.

The New York Times has reported that Israeli military officers conveyed the information to the leaders of the U.N. Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Safety and Security in Gaza just before midnight local time on Friday, October 13.

The UN‚Äôs spokesperson St√©phane Dujarric has told reporters that such a direction would lead to ‚Äúdevastating humanitarian consequences.‚Äù

Guardian has quoted Dujarric as having also said, ‚ÄúThe United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.‚Äù

The rally, which was held on the College of Staten Island campus and endorsed by the college‚Äôs Muslim Students Association, drew a crowd of roughly 100 supporters, who decried decades of Israeli occupation of what they deem Palestinian land.

Supporters voiced frustration with the national media‚Äôs coverage of the decades-long conflict, claiming networks selectively highlight violence against Israelis while ignoring the thousands of Palestinian deaths that have accrued.

instagram,"Human Rights Watch has confirmed the use of white phosphorus by Israeli forces during military operations in Lebanon and Gaza on October 10 and 11, 2023. Verified through video evidence and witness accounts, the footage portrays numerous artillery-fired white phosphorus airbursts, observed over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border.

White phosphorus, known for its dual use as a smokescreen or a weapon, carries significant risks for civilians due to the severe burns it inflicts and its enduring, detrimental impact on survivors. Its deployment in densely populated regions of Gaza represents a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, mandating conflict parties to take all possible precautions to prevent harm to civilians. Moreover, this distressing revelation underscores the imperative to critically review the adequacy and standing of Protocol III of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), the sole international legislation dedicated to regulating incendiary weapons.

Issam era bem mais jovem que eu e apesar disso era muito experiente na cobertura de conflitos. Nos encontramos em Odesa, o clima era tenso, mas ele me acolheu de uma forma muito profissional, respeitosa e carinhosa. Ele foi sempre cordial comigo. O cara era bem humorado demais, sorriamos sempre que era poss√≠vel. Foi batizado por mim como ""BirdMan"" porque passava todos os nossos deslocamentos mastigando sementes de girrasol (eu expliquei que no Brasil os passaros eram quem comiam aquilo). Issam √© aquele tipo de colega que mandava mensagem para comentar um trabalho seu. Atento sempre mesmo que fosse para elogiar uma publicac√£o ou simplesmente enviar um meme engra√ßado que tivesse haver com alguma situa√ß√£o nossa. Um cinegrafista de m√£o cheia, super t√©cnico e criativo. Dono de um restaurante lindo no L√≠bano e um adorador de gatos. Rep√≥rter com um lado humano agu√ßado (poucos de n√≥s possui essa qualidade). Nas √∫ltimas vezes que nos falamos foi por video chamada: ele estava no restaurante eu na minha casa. Come√ßamos a conversa e ele foi logo fazendo quest√£o de mostrar o adesivo da bandeira do brasil que colou no seu computador ainda na Ucrania, e eu j√° sorrindo alto mostrei um punhado de semente de girassol (rssss). Falamos sobre o trabalho, a empresa e amenidades. Sorrimos e nos despedimos. Uns dias depois me mandou um √°udio me dando parab√©ns por meu anivers√°rio. Eu n√£o sabia que essa era a nossa √∫ltima conversa. A guerra √© cruel para todos, mas √© mais ainda para quem morre nela. Lament√°vel o que est√° acontecendo. Rep√∫dio total a qualquer tipo de guerra. Eu acabei de escutar a mensagem de voz novamente e foi imposs√≠vel n√£o me emocionar. Eu s√≥ te desejo coisas boas Issam.

Vrijdag vond er een steekpartij plaats op een Franse middelbare school. De politie heeft de aanvaller aangehouden.

De steekpartij vond plaats op de middelbare school Gambetta in het Franse Arras. Een leraar is overleden aan zijn verwondingen. Een andere docent en een bewaker van de school zijn ernstig gewond geraakt.

Over het motief is nog niets bekend. De politie zegt dat niets wijst op een verband tussen de aanval op de middelbare school en het conflict in Isra√´l.

De aangehouden verdachte werd al in de gaten gehouden door de Franse veiligheidsdiensten.

instagram,"Israel deployed white phosphorus over Gaza and Lebanon during its conflict with Hamas, said Human Rights Watch on October 12. White phosphorus is known to ignite when it comes in contact with air, leading to intense burning that can extend to cloth, fuel, ammunition, and various combustible materials.

Human Rights Watch, an international non-governmental organization headquartered in New York City said it has verified videos of October 10 and October 11. It videos show ‚Äúmultiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border.‚Äù

The HRW report also states that the use of white phosphorus ‚Äúmagnifies the risk to civilians and violates the international humanitarian law prohibition on putting civilians at unnecessary risk‚Äù. 

What is White Phosphorus?
White phosphorus is a highly reactive and controversial chemical compound which has unique properties that make it both a versatile industrial tool and a source of significant concern. White phosphorus exists as a waxy, translucent substance that can spontaneously ignite when exposed to air, emitting a luminous glow.

This nature of the compound has led to its use in various applications, from military applications like smoke screens to industrial processes such as manufacturing fertilizers. 

Why Is White Phosphorus Dangerous For Human Health?

One of the major concerns is that it can spontaneously ignite upon exposure to air. This property, while useful in industrial applications like military smoke screens, becomes a perilous attribute in warfare. The intense burning it produces upon ignition can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening burns when it comes into contact with human skin. 

In addition to its direct impact, white phosphorus can release toxic fumes when burned. Inhalation of these fumes can cause respiratory distress and damage the respiratory system, leading to long-term health issues. Moreover, the substance‚Äôs ability to adhere to the skin makes decontamination challenging, exacerbating the health risks for those exposed.

instagram,"Israel's army has said that all the people living in northern Gaza must move to the southern region within the next 24 hours, the United Nations has said. This indicates that a massive ground invasion may be on the cards.

Israel has been bombing the isolated coastal strip in retaliation to Hamas' attacks, which began on October 7. Thousands have died in the escalation of the conflict, that has seen severely polarised reactions from global leaders. The Israeli air force has dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza since October 7, it has announced on X

Already, the UN has announced that no aid has been able to come in from the outside of the Gaza Strip for its 2.3 million residents. There is a water crisis, no food and no electricity as Israel has blocked access to such essentials in a move that has been called ""inhuman, violent and brutal"" and a distinct war crime. In addition, the Human Rights Watch has reported that white phosphorus is being used by Israel on the Gaza Strip. It is used for signalling, obscuring, or to set fires but can severely burn people and set structures on fire.

The New York Times has reported that Israeli military officers conveyed the information to the leaders of the U.N. Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Safety and Security in Gaza just before midnight local time on Friday, October 13.

The UN's spokesperson St√©phane Dujarric has told reporters that such a direction would lead to ""devastating humanitarian consequences.""

Guardian has quoted Dujarric as having also said, ""The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.""

instagram,"The reactive-legal abuse cycle is the downward spiral many abuse victims get caught in when dealing with a narcissistic ex in the family court system.

The abuser provokes, antagonizes, and gaslights their victim until the victim reacts. That reaction might be angry words, acts of defiance, some form of retaliation, etc. The abuser than parades the reaction in front of the court and uses it as a weapon to manipulate the situation.

The active, using the reaction in court is itself a further form of provocation and abuse, which often elicits additional reactions from the victim. Left unchecked, the cycle often repeats and repeats in a downward spiral of escalating conflict.

The narcissist‚Äôs legal team often contributes to the worsening situation by intentionally creating the most hostile environment possible for the opposing party (aka the abuse victim). They then shamelessly exploit any reactive behaviors in the name of ‚Äúrepresenting their client‚Äôs best interests.‚Äù

This worsening cycle of incessant provocations followed by court interventions based on reactive behaviors is nothing other than the continuation of abuse.

instagram,"In a heartening development, the first charter flight under 'Operation Ajay' successfully facilitated the return of 212 Indian citizens stranded in Israel due to the ongoing conflict. The flight, organized by the Indian government, landed at Delhi Airport on Friday morning, bringing relief to those affected by the war.

Union Minister Rajiv Chandrashekhar welcomed the passengers with a 'Namaste' gesture, emphasizing the government's commitment to ensuring the safety of its citizens. ""Our government will never leave any Indian behind. Our Prime Minister is determined to protect them, bring them back home safely,"" stated Chandrashekhar. Passengers were chosen on a ""first come first serve"" basis, and the government bore the entire cost of their return. The evacuation became crucial as Air India had suspended its flights on October 7, leaving many stranded.

Chandrashekhar expressed gratitude to External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar, the ministry's team, and the Air India flight crew for their efforts in making the evacuation possible. He reassured the returning citizens, saying, ""We are grateful...for bringing our children back home safely and soundly and back home to their loved ones."" A relieved Indian national, evacuated from the war-battered region, conveyed appreciation for the government's prompt response, stating, ""We are very thankful to the Indian government, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing us back."" Expressing hope for peace, the individual added, ""We are hoping for peace as soon as possible so that we can go back to work at the earliest.""

The evacuation was conducted under 'Operation Ajay,' and the passengers were selected based on registrations in the Indian embassy's database. Despite the challenges, the Indian embassy's coordination and timely notifications provided a sense of relief to the stranded citizens. Shubham Kumar, a student in Israel, expressed gratitude, saying, ""We felt like the embassy of India is connected with us, which was a kind of relief to us. And then we got all the arrangements.""

instagram,"There is a dangerous development in the campaign to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for damage caused by climate change.

While the war between Israel and Hamas consumes the world's attention, the fossil fuel industry is quietly working to delay and sabotage legal proceedings in the US to hold it accountable for its leading role in creating global warming. There are about 25 legal cases pending in US courts brought by cities and states against the oil majors and the industry lobbying group The American Petroleum Institute.

The fossil fuel industry's latest gambit is to try to dismiss these cases by arguing the industry is not responsible for the massive damage caused by climate change because it had no ""duty to warn"" the public. Industry lawyers cynically claim oil companies had no ""duty to warn"" because knowledge of climate change was available decades ago -- even though oil majors like Chevron and Exxon tried to deceive the public by hiding that very information. They did this by suppressing their own internal scientific research pointing to inevitable and drastic climate change, while at the same time paying lobbyists at front groups like the Heartland Institute to create ""uncertainty"" about the issue in public.

A mastermind of the new industry legal strategy is none other than Ted Boutrous of Gibson Dunn, the same fossil fuel law firm Chevron paid to orchestrate my private corporate prosecution after we helped Indigenous peoples in Ecuador's Amazon win a historic $10 billion pollution judgment. Boutrous also represents the New York Times in its media and First Amendment work ‚Äì a clear conflict of interest for the newspaper which might help explain why it never covered Chevron's orchestration of my illegal 993-day detention in retaliation for winning the Ecuador pollution case. Boutrous himself was intimately involved in the targeting of me and the affected Amazon communities of Ecuador.

She stressed that Israel‚Äôs security was the prime motivation for Germany‚Äôs actions as a state and added, ‚Äúnothing comes before that‚Äù.

ü§ù The minister also hopes to draw on international diplomacy in this time of crisis to prevent the conflict spreading across the region. For this, she is prioritising working with Israel‚Äôs partners and neighbours. Before departing on her trip in solidarity with Israel, Baerbock warned that ‚ÄúHamas terrorism brings with it the risk of destabilising the whole region.‚Äù

üáÆüá± Israel has been in shock since the attack by Hamas, which killed hundreds. ‚ÄúNow we must prevent other actors in the region pouring oil on the fire,‚Äù said Germany‚Äôs Federal Foreign Minister, whose plans while in Israel include meeting her counterpart Eli Cohen. A spokesperson for the Federal Foreign Office said that Baerbock would use the talks to focus on ways of supporting Israel. She would also discuss the fate of the people taken hostage by Hamas.

üí¨ Baerbock herself said that Hamas brought only suffering and death to people, both in Israel and in Gaza. ‚ÄúIt is the perfidious strategy of Hamas to abuse the civilian population by employing them as human shields,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe cannot allow the script of terrorism to take hold.‚ÄùBaerbock also stressed that civilians need safe spaces where they can find protection and access the bare necessities.

Don‚Äôt be ignorant to what is the historical objective truth. 

Also, don‚Äôt be a victim of misinformation and propaganda- there are a number of influencers on social media who are reporting misinformation as facts and reliable news sources who are also purporting this information as fact. 

It is very clear that a lot of this is going on in western media and I‚Äôll do a post this weekend helping you guys pinpoint when something looks like it is propaganda or it is misinformation.

instagram,"Mirwaiz Umar Farooq expresses Solidarity with people of Palestine, Calls for International Resolution to End Ongoing Conflict

Mutahida Majlis-e-Ulema Patron Mirwaiz Umar Farooq expressed great anguish and grief at the loss of previous human lives including women and children in the latest escalation in the Palestinian Israel conflict. Mirwaiz said that the roots of this conflict are again in its colonial past -in the decisions taken by the colonial masters while they ruled , the tragic impact of which is being suffered by the locals till date.

He said that Palestinian's have been gravely wronged and are suffering as a consequence of the the conflict . Routinely their young, women and even children are killed , their homes are bombed and destroyed , they are subjected to humiliation and surveillance all the time , their livelihood fast dwindling. Palestinians say that they they live in the worlds largest open air prison. Even the holy site of Masjid e Al Aqua is desecrated, which causes pain and anger among Muslims. Christian's and their holy places are also violated.
Millions of Palestinian‚Äôs  are forced  refugees, while their land is occupied by outside settlers . And with each passing decade , their land in their own country is shrinking for them .

Mirwaiz said sadly no agreement or solution is honoured by Israel or acceptable to them. Instead they have turned Palestine  into a colony, and are expanding their footprint both in Gaza and west bank by pursuing settler colonialism. while all this is going on openly, the world looks other way, driven purely by their geo economic interests. The UN too has failed the Palestinians .
so unless the conflict is addressed by international community, giving justice to  Palestinians,  its tragic offshoots will keep cropping up . A human and just resolution of this conflict , based on the accepted principle of the right of people on their land and freedom, has to be established. injustice leads to conflict and repeated violence and that is what is happening there.

Mirwaiz said that  people of Kashmir stand united in unwavering solidarity with the people of Palestine, sharing a deep hope for the resolution of the conflict",,1704,"{'like_count': 1698, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 180691}",kulgam news agency,,2023-10-13 16:56:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/299618717_591624789348769_196339631474842335_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=XXAlxcJmTDMAX9jKs-H&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBHr2B8Mm5O9XqIiv5podkiusqz9Bz9T5CZuEqOhBZCIQ&oe=655A10F8,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWLOpgBKfI/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391253832_1001306487591581_8015194112527735465_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=bhNxX-RK3wwAX-jPWzW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAqr3waol20Gys6HFAZsOTdABXiyrFcSOV8rFsIzO1kjw&oe=65324E42

But the Conflict in Palestine has taken the world stage. Even prompting a statement to be put out by the NFL.

It‚Äôs noble to mourn the lives of any civilian caught in a crossfire. 

Will there be a moment of silence for Palestinian civilians the same as for Israelis?

After decades of Palestinians having their land stolen, being killed for fun and being reduced to an open air prison, a genocide has begun against the Palestinian people. 

In recent days, they‚Äôve had chemical weapons used against civilians, their homes were bombed to rubble, countless people have been displaced, water, food and electricity were shut off, leaving thousands dead and hundreds of them being children.

Babies are being starved and killed.

If the NFL does not want to engage in politics, it shouldn‚Äôt do so. But if it does, the NFL should act with the best of character and follow the wise words of Malcolm X:

‚ÄúI'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I'm a human being, first and foremost, and as such I'm for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.‚Äù

I pray the NFL reconsiders who it supports politically.

instagram,"According to sources at POLITICO, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned a small group of lawmakers last week that his department is tracking the possibility that Azerbaijan could soon invade Armenia, according to two people familiar with the conversation.

The call indicates the depth of concern in the administration about Azerbaijan‚Äôs operations against a breakaway region in the west of the country and the possibility of the conflict spreading, reports POLITICO.

Azerbaijiani President Ilham Aliyev has previously called on Armenia to open a ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù along its southern border, linking mainland Azerbaijan to an exclave that borders Turkey and Iran. Aliyev has threatened to solve the issue ‚Äúby force.‚Äù

In an Oct. 3 phone call, lawmakers pressed Blinken on possible measures against Aliyev in response to his country‚Äôs invasion of the Nagorno-Karabakh region in September, the people said, who were granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive call.

Blinken responded that the State Department was looking at avenues to hold Azerbaijan accountable and isn‚Äôt planning to renew a long-standing waiver that allows the U.S. to provide military assistance to Baku. He added that State saw a possibility that Azerbaijan would invade southern Armenia in the coming weeks.

Still, Blinken expressed confidence about ongoing diplomatic talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan to the Democratic lawmakers, among them Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Anna Eshoo of California, and Frank Pallone of New Jersey.

instagram,"‚ú®When there is turbulence in the world, it can be a delicate balance for yoga teachers as we discern the difference between knowing what to say and knowing when to remain silent. Whether the conflict is political, societal, or global, I feel that it is important for us to help hold space for all emotions, opinions, and ways of being.

üíïHere are 11 Ways to Hold Space for Difficult Emotions in Your Yoga Classes from an article I wrote for Yoga Journal. Your role is not to have all the answers for students...

1. Leave your politics at the door.
2. Encourage students to set an intention for their practice.
3. Channel your emotions.
4. Be honest.
5. Practice self-care.
6. Hold space for all your students‚Äô emotions.
7. Do what feels authentic to you‚Ä¶ within reason.
8. Be sensitive to everyone.
9. Bring everyone‚Äôs attention to their breath.
10. Minimize your alignment cues.
11. Remember why you wanted to teach yoga.

instagram,"At a time when Indian media is more concerned about Israel-Palestine conflict than Manipur violence, the Manipur government has banned the circulation of videos and photos of violence that hit the northeast state in May.

The directive comes just days after a video, purportedly showing a man being burnt, had surfaced on social media, triggering fresh outrage and condemnation. The police had said that the video was related to the May 4 strip-parade case which the CBI is probing. Grappling with frequent tension following sharing of videos and photographs, the govt said its a ""positive step towards bringing normalcy to the conflict-hit state.

An order by the Governor issued through the state Home Department on Wednesday stated that the state government took circulating images of violent activities ""very seriously and with utmost sensitivity."" It stated that images of activities such as inflicting bodily harm and damage to public or private property are likely to facilitate the mobilisation of ""mobs of agitators and demonstrators,"" aggravating the law and order situation in the state.

It went on to say that anyone in possession of such images should approach the nearest Superintendent of Police and submit them for legal action, but if they are found to be circulating such images through social media, they shall be booked and prosecuted ""under relevant provision of the law of land."" It also stated that those found ""misusing technology for inciting violence/ hatred"" will be dealt with under provisions of the IT Act and the IPC. Mobile internet services were again suspended in the state till October 16.

instagram,"Employers are often reluctant to fire workers. They need to offer severance packages and risk having the employee accuse the company of discrimination or prejudice for letting them go. It‚Äôs among the worst, most uncomfortable tasks for a human resources professional or manager. Supervisors may want to avoid conflict with employees. Nudging them to leave of their own volition can be a way for companies to manage their workforce and reduce costs.

In behavioral economics, a ‚Äúnudge‚Äù is a gentle prompt that influences people‚Äôs behavior. It refers to how HR and business leaders can use gentle cues to encourage employees to behave in a specific manner‚Äîlike investing in their pension, exceeding deadlines, participating in feedback surveys, or pushing a worker out the door.

instagram,"I start posting but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm inspired to share. For the first time I wasn‚Äôt proud of my Instagram community. Even when Ukrainian war started I felt much more connected and understood. Now I have a deeply rooted question about whom I want to inspire. I surely don‚Äôt want to entertain people that don‚Äôt know the difference between compassion, human empathy and political/social/ideological reasoning. There‚Äôs no conflict there. If there is, then you were fed with propaganda. So the mental building on the top of your emotional response should be rechecked. You obviously miss the point. That feeling of uncomfortable being with yourself is the indicator. Nothing is black and white. No ancient conflict can be described and solved in few words or infographics.

instagram,"Fascinating isn't it? The way the world divides when it comes to the Israeli Palestinian conflict.

First you have identity. Which becomes conflated with a plot of land. Suddenly the inhabitants of the land become synonymous with genetic similarity and by extension religion.

So when something occurs on that land, those that identify with the symbol think it's actually happening to them, even if they've never been to the land, etc.

A person could be born in California, never leave, never encounter racism or antisemitism in their own life, and still feel a connection to Israel because of a parent's heritage. 

It's basic religious nationalist tribal identity stuff.

On the news they reported how many ""Americans"" died in the horrible Israeli massacre by Hamas -- as if it really means anything. 

And then you have people sympathetic to Palestine which spirals into another array of associations.

Indigenous cultures may see the Israeli occupation of Palestine as representative of their own history. 

Academics and people who have studied the conflict for the past 75 years may have moral outrage at the double standards that have been fostered and in that outrage they put themselves in the perceived position, charging their own emotions.

At the end of the day what we appear to be doing is putting/feeling ourselves in hard positions and that ability to have sympathy and empathy is a positive human characteristic as deep down we all wish to take care of others, as we see others as ourselves.

Yet, when we start to have preferences; one assumed group loyalty over another, ‚Äì that is where the real trouble resides. 

Because it takes on a life of its own.

We all link back to mitochondrial Eve. We are all brothers and sisters biologically. What we call ethnicity and race are illusions, driven simply by regional exposures. A group on one side of the planet has darker skin and different physical features than a group on the other side of the planet as a process of evolution.

Our brains remain fundamentally the same in the average capacity to learn, develop and adapt.

That means national, religious, ethnic and so-called racial identity is all a delusion.

Helps nothing.",,1477,"{'like_count': 1441, 'comment_count': 36, 'num_users': 48455}",Peter Joseph,,2023-10-13 14:07:24,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/134123718_309444433757166_4075125511385985935_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=zb9ES1O5Pu8AX9wPx94&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDE_Om1LvFqKvZaHQhLlcXxBpfePoogC3l_ZfoO7SCZdA&oe=655B1315,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyV33hkuvmF/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390976349_1374690070099688_2524749385677251395_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=L8AIw5kPU_AAX_VIPw_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBsFA-fh8WSDVNB2t6y6susk9nBcTr2gU_SjWIgRbukWA&oe=655047F5

The attack prompted retaliatory strikes on Gaza and a declaration of war by the Israeli prime minister.

It may seem like the leaders are all fanatics, and that the situation is ‚Äútoo complicated,‚Äù and there are no viable solutions other than more violence.

instagram,"New Delhi: In a hurry to get on to his party‚Äôs bandwagon against opposition Congress‚Äôs statement on the Israel-Palestine conflict, Nagaland deputy chief minister and a top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from the Northeast, Yanthungo Patton, seemed to have only flaunted his ignorance about the country he was siding with.

The Hindutva brigade came out in full support of Israel and termed Hamas (and also all of Palestine, civilians included) a ‚Äòterrorist‚Äô on social media platforms in tandem with Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs all-out support to Israel.

Northeast BJP leaders like Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma soon jumped on to X to follow the prime minister‚Äôs line. Patton seemed to have thought of adding an extra angle to grab the attention of the Christian-majority population of his state. In an upload on X, he accused the Congress of being ‚Äúanti-Christian‚Äù by claiming that Israel is a ‚ÄúChristian country‚Äù.

‚ÄúCongress party is anti-Christian party. PM Modi stood in solidarity with a Christian country ‚Äì Israel, but Congress party instead of supporting Israel supports terrorist Hamas. So Congress Party is anti-Christian,‚Äù he wrote.

Soon, Patton, an MLA from the Christian-majority Tyui assembly constituency, was trolled for not knowing that Israel is a Jewish state and yet commenting on the Israel-Palestine face-off. It pushed him to delete the text, but not before it went viral in the region.

BBC journalists covering the attack on Israel were assaulted and held at gunpoint after they were stopped by police in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
Muhannad Tutunji, Haitham Abudiab and their BBC Arabic team were driving to a hotel when their car was intercepted.
They were dragged from the vehicle - marked ""TV"" in red tape - searched and pushed against a wall.
A BBC spokesperson said journalists ""must be able to report on the conflict in Israel-Gaza freely"".
While attempting to film the incident, Mr Tutunji said his phone was thrown on the ground and he was struck on the neck.
""One of our BBC News Arabic teams deployed in Tel Aviv, in a vehicle clearly marked as media, was stopped and assaulted last night by Israeli police. Journalists must be able to report on the conflict in Israel-Gaza freely,"" a BBC spokesperson said.

Created between 1988 and 1991, the photographs predate the 1993 Joint Declaration on Peace and the subsequent periods of ceasefires and Peace Process. It is an unsentimental view of working-class loyalist communities in both Belfast and further afield during that time, capturing the often surreal nature of daily life set in the backdrop of conflict.

The work is presented in Belfast in a new light, over three decades after it was first published and now in tandem with Mariusz Smiejek's Not Surrendering - which provides a contemporary view of many of the issues and communities featured in my earlier work.

Join Mariusz and I for a joint artist talk on October 19 to learn more about this work.

instagram,"Pray for Israel & America, and family members of those massacred by Hamas Terrorist. 

Israeli soldiers found an ISIS flag among the belongings of a Hamas operative, drawing a connection between the two terrorist groups.

ISIS, also ISIL or the Islamic State, is an Iranian funded terror group that in 2014 declared a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. 

Hamas brought ISIS flags to massacre Israeli children, women and men.

Hamas is a genocidal terrorist organization. Hamas is worse than ISIS.

A connection between the two terror groups was also made by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and¬†Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Netanyahu made a direct connection between the two terror groups, saying: ""Hamas is ISIS.""

""Just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed and Hamas should be treated exactly the way ISIS was treated,"" Netanyahu said. ""They should be spit out from the community of nations. No leaders should meet them. No country should harbor them. And those that do should be sanctioned."" And, ""There will be many difficult days ahead, but I have no doubt that the forces of civilization will win.""

Blinken highlighted the brutality of Hamas, including beheadings and the burning of victims, which the world also saw during ISIS's rise to power.

""Hamas has only one agenda: to destroy Israel and to murder. No country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens or simply return to the conditions that allowed it to take place,"" he said. ""Israel has the right, indeed, the obligation to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens. So the prime minister and I discussed how Israel does this matters. Our humanity, the value that we place on human life and human dignity. That's what makes us who we are. And we count them among our greatest strength.""¬†

Blinken followed up these remarks by underscoring U.S. support for Israel amid its conflict with Hamas.

""My message to Israel is this: You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself but as long as America exists, you'll never have to,"" he said.

The U.S. State Department has designated both ISIS and Hamas foreign terrorist organizations.",,1131,"{'like_count': 1042, 'comment_count': 89, 'num_users': 279388}",David Dodd,,2023-10-13 01:46:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/274309751_356111589723671_1727945379893791702_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=X-eHCCW5m-EAX-bJVEd&_nc_oc=AQkcySqlYlXQrKyZWIbwHcNqn0KUKKPyr5UMLcKX71GEnpYIIT-mWOajrcCJZUTwNFg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDUTNFezs2So1VxREUWQ9aHHngw3FFqWbWQdh7a-A6yBA&oe=6559F501,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyUjHkUu0Gx/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387270327_306712155440078_3418126908753566229_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=1OjJuUUMxZsAX9K32a1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCIzwl7de0RlO7ogz0KvAeDW9XVe-IgzaFCJvRcBfkc-Q&oe=655A2041

instagram,"On Saturday, October 7, 2023, Hamas launched attacks against Israel that many media outlets referred to as ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù and ‚Äúhistoric.‚Äù

As is common with news of this scale and significance, reports spread widely, and rapidly, often without proper context or verification.

As a result, many key storylines have included potential misinformation or misleading claims. Here are some reports this week that have been confusing, misleading, or lacking context.

instagram,"It has been more than 24 hours since Fatima has heard from her only daughter Lubna Nazir as she is stranded in Gaza amid the recent Israel-Palestine conflict. Now she is struggling to get in touch with Nazir to hear from her for once.

Lubna Nazir is a 52-year-old Kashmiri woman living in the Gaza Strip with her husband and two children ever since she got married to a Palestinian man some 20 years ago.

Israel says it has dropped 6,000 bombs in six days of bombardment of Gaza. On Friday, the zionist military asked over 1.1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza in 24 hours.

‚ÄúThis could be my last call as my phone doesn‚Äôt have enough battery and there is no electricity, water, or food here. Don‚Äôt know for how long we will survive, there is shelling and bombardment all over,‚Äù these were Nazir‚Äôs words when she spoke with her mother Fatima and cousin Adnan.

Two days ago, Israel imposed a complete siege on the already blockaded Gaza Strip cutting off all food, water, electricity, and fuel supply. Gaza‚Äôs sole power plant has also collapsed leaving the conflict-ridden area in a complete blackout. The internet services have also been snapped with no further notice of restoration.

Nazir told her mother that her family in Gaza is not being able to lead their usual day or step out of the house as White Phosphorus starts pouring anytime during the day or night. Her kids and husband have not gone to school and work as there is shelling all around, as narrated by Adnan Jaan, Nazir‚Äôs maternal cousin to Maktoob on Thursday, October 12.

‚ÄúShe has been living there for years and it has always been a conflict zone, but this time it was different, we could hear the sound of bombs falling in the background while we were talking with her‚Äù, said Jaan.

Jaan told Maktoob, ‚ÄúShe told us that she would try to relocate to some nearest safe place but commuting is also unsafe at the moment. She can‚Äôt stay there and she can‚Äôt move out.‚Äù

Fatima,80, is worried to the extent that she has not been able to eat or sleep ever since she last spoke with Nazir.

instagram,"Israel-Palestine Conflict Sparks Demonstrations Across Region

Israel has sealed off Gaza and launched sustained retaliatory air strikes, which have killed at least 1,400 people with more than 300,000 displaced, after a large-scale attack by Hamas. On October 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel from Gaza by land, sea, and air, killing over 1,300 people and wounding around 2,800. Israeli soldiers and civilians have also been taken hostage by Hamas and moved into Gaza. The attack prompted a declaration of war by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the announcement of an emergency wartime government.

instagram,"Reposted from @no_moreabuse_ They are Shitty People - Narcissists exhibit toxic and detrimental behavior, making them truly awful individuals. ‚Å£
They possess an inflated sense of self-importance and a grandiose view of themselves, constantly seeking admiration and validation from others. 

Their behavior is characterised by manipulative tactics, lack of empathy, and a tendency to blame everyone but themselves for their shortcomings and mistakes.

One key reason narcissists are considered ""shitty people"" is their inability to take responsibility for their actions. 

They deflect blame onto others, refusing to acknowledge their own faults or shortcomings. 

Instead of accepting accountability, they engage in gaslighting, manipulation, and shifting blame onto their victims. 

This allows them to maintain their self-perceived superiority and avoid facing the consequences of their behavior.

Narcissists lack empathy, disregarding the feelings and needs of others. 

They exploit and manipulate individuals to meet their own needs, viewing relationships as a means to gain power and control. 

They show little regard for the emotional well-being of those around them and often engage in emotional abuse, leaving their victims traumatised and in need of healing.

Furthermore, narcissists thrive on creating chaos and conflict. 

They enjoy provoking negative emotions and creating a toxic atmosphere in relationships. 

By blaming others, they divert attention away from their own toxic behavior, perpetuating a cycle of emotional abuse and manipulation.

Narcissists also have a strong need for constant admiration and validation.

The propaganda machine that is fueling increased divisive speech throughout communities worldwide leaving a vacuum where our greatest assets of love, compassion and unity should flourish, is now being filled with the immoral rhetoric of hatred, indifference and bigotry. All this is inevitably propelling us into further conflict and escalation of violence, the end result of which will not bring peace. If history has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that we learn nothing from history. 

Picking sides is a tiresome and petty form of conflict resolution. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Appeal to your logic, not your emotion. Tribalism is death. At its core it poses an existential threat. Don‚Äôt engage. You are human. That‚Äôs it. The loss of Israeli life is horrific. The loss of Palestinian life is horrific. It‚Äôs all barbaric and unconscionable. 

Our world is being pushed to the brink of irreparable harm by the decisions of adult children who are playing Battleship. They want you to turn a blind eye to the ramifications of war. Don‚Äôt play their game. Your hatred is their commodity. There‚Äôs no hatred ‚Äúout there.‚Äù Hatred is in the mind. Abandon it and you will never find it ‚Äúout there.‚Äù Let ‚Äúother‚Äù be the object of your compassion, not the object of your hatred. ‚ÄúNever again‚Äù CANNOT be a moniker of relief for some and for others a fantasy they will never be recognized within.",,987,"{'like_count': 962, 'comment_count': 25, 'num_users': 53209}",Dominic Rains,,2023-10-13 11:13:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/395415649_1314857305857912_8599733960340887311_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pFZD1uhqavwAX_owafI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDZK9W88j13VAhuhubt8jI7n1Zfuu0mAcOXhdvyssZkYg&oe=655A4CAC,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyVkBYjNny5/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390691100_966987724366734_1446099341985168439_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=MolWJx2tlo0AX-lW5TD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDyLkO6x7byxvr_ujyekiPCpYT3FQhMqc5VWBnsOgCbnw&oe=655A8082

instagram,"Waylands Smithy Neolithic Long Barrow.
Wayland‚Äôs Smithy is a Neolithic burial site. It was a tomb (grave) built of of stone and wood. There was a narrow wooden box, into which people were successively placed. The remains of 11 men, 2 women and a child, were discovered when it was excavated in 1963. New radiocarbon dating has shown that the first burials were probably placed there in 3590-3555 BC, and the last in 3580-3550 BC. The barrow was therefore used for no more than 15 years, less than a single generation. It is also possible that the barrow was used for an even shorter period of time, perhaps just a year. We don‚Äôt know what circumstances caused this group of people to be interred over such a short period. Perhaps the group suffered some illness or injury during conflict. There are potentially three or more people who suffered lethal arrowhead strikes, and two individuals whose remains were subject to scavenging by animals before burial. After a period of between 40 and 100 years, the structure was covered by an oval mound of chalk and earth. This formed a monument that would today be described as a long barrow. This mound signalled the closure of the barrow.

instagram,"The F9F Panther, Grumman‚Äôs first jet fighter in its line of Fighting Cats, started its life during the late stages of the Second World War. Keen to capitalize on the emergence of jet technology, Grumman submitted their G-75, a four engine fighter similar in configuration to the F7F, model to a Navy competition seeking a jet powered night fighter. The G-75, however, would lose the contract to the Douglas F3D Skyknight. Despite this, the Navy issued a contract to Grumman to produce two G-75 Prototypes, designated XF9F-1, as a backup in case the F3D ran into developmental issues. Grumman eventually decided that the G-75 did not have much potential, and started working on a single engine day fighter, internally known as the G-79. Choosing not to cancel the G-75 contract, the Navy updated the request to include three prototypes of the entirely different G-79. (Note: No G-75 prototypes were ever constructed)

The G-79 would be powered by an imported Rolls Royce Nene engine, as there were no American built engines that were reliable enough for the rigors of navy operation. The Nene would be produced under license as the P&W J42. A larger version of the same engine, the RR Tay, would be used in later models, as the P&W J48.¬†

By 1947, the Prototype Panther, the XF9F-2, conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Corky Meyer. Initial flight testing revealed issues with stability, These issues would quickly be polished out, and by 1949, the Panther would undergo carrier trials. While the USAF was still content with the WWII arrangement of .50 caliber MGs, the Navy had already moved to standardizing a quartet of 20mm cannons, which would be fitted to the Panther.¬†

The panther would prove to me a critical asset during the Korean War, and would be the widest used Navy jet fighter in the conflict. Over 78,000 sorties would be flown by panthers, and would down seven enemy MiGs.¬†

The Durability of the Panther was impressive, and deserves its own post.¬†

The headlines we scroll past are more than mere statistics; they're a mirror reflecting the wounds of our shared humanity. Each life lost, each home shattered‚Äîthese are calls to action that reverberate in each of us.

To my fellow Americans, your voice has the power to turn the tide. The link in my bio will guide you to your elected representatives and a script you can use.  Make the call and demand an immediate ceasefire and a move toward peace and justice.

In this complex web of global tensions, the key to change starts within us. Reflect today: what parts of yourself need reconciliation? Our personal growth has the power to ripple out into broader transformations.

Though celestial phenomena may momentarily captivate us, let's ground ourselves in the here and now, and anchor our hearts in empathy and understanding. Love, not division, must guide us.

This cosmic alignment is a moment in time, but its implications can last a lifetime. Will you be a beacon of peace or a passive bystander? Your path to action starts with the link in my bio‚Äîuse it now.

instagram,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Capitol Police and several law enforcement agencies in the D.C. area say they are increasing security and visibility as rumors circulate on social media about a threatened ""day of rage.""

Law enforcement in the nation‚Äôs capital and other major cities including New York and Los Angeles are preparing following reports that former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal made a call for global protests to be held Friday. 

Historically, these kinds of calls have caused widespread demonstrations in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank but haven‚Äôt led to any large-scale action in the U.S. But considering the unprecedented circumstances surrounding this war, federal, state and local leaders are erring on the side of caution.

The call to action comes days after war broke out between Israel and Hamas following a surprise attack by the militant Islamist group that killed hundreds and left thousands more injured. 

As the rocket attacks and deadly raids continue, the death toll has steadily risen with more than 1,200 now reported dead and more than 3,000 injured. Along with that, Hamas claims to have taken at least 150 hostages into Gaza.

More than 1,100 people have already been killed in Gaza as Israel continues to strike back. At least 27 American citizens have died in the conflict and another 14 are missing, National Security Council official John Kirby confirmed Thursday.

The extraordinary escalation of the decades-long conflict between Israel and pro-Palestinian radicals sent shockwaves across the globe and enormous suffering on both sides has sparked demonstrations. 

Rallies were held in D.C. Sunday at the Washington Memorial, the White House and the Israeli Embassy after the violence broke out. Tributes were set up to honor and remember the hundreds of people killed in Israel while pro-Palestinian demonstrators were also present, holding flags and standing in solidarity.

The French prime minister has put the country on its highest state of counter-terrorism alert after an assailant fatally stabbed a teacher and seriously injured two others.

Witnesses say the knifeman shouted ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is greatest"", during the attack at a school in Arras, northern France. He is now in custody.
The ""attack emergency"" level has been used in previous counter-terror cases.

The alert can trigger extra security deployments and public warnings.

The attack came amid rising tensions in France's sizeable Muslim and Jewish communities due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

There's been riot around France over what's happening between Israel and Palestine..

Deeply disturbing news are emerging from the Gaza Strip.

The Israeli Army's latest directive forces the southward expulsion and relocation of the local Palestinians within 24 hours.

For a population of over 1.1 million in that area, this essentially amounts to an imminent life threatening act towards the survival of civilian men, women and children.

The forceful depopulation of northern Gaza is an unequivocal humanitarian catastrophe that cannot be disregarded.

I therefore call upon the world leaders and the international community to intervene and prevent this humanitarian crisis and further atrocities.

instagram,"In a heart-wrenching account from a Roya journalist in Gaza, @wizard_bisan1, the unfolding crisis continues to expose the dire circumstances faced by innocent civilians.

The journalist highlights a horrifying event in #Gaza, demonstrating the severe consequences of the ongoing conflict.

Earlier, it was reported that civilians were urged to evacuate from northern areas to southern regions via a ""safe route.""

However, Bisan Odeh reveals the grim reality of this evacuation attempt. Instead of ensuring the safety of those fleeing the conflict, the so-called safe route became a treacherous journey.

While attempting to follow the guidance and leave their homes behind, people were met with targeted attacks on ambulances, cars, and buses traveling along the road.

She said, in an Instagram video posted on her official account, ‚ÄúDo you remember when I said that they pushed people to evacuate from the northern to the southern areas via a safe route, as they said? Okay, that was a trick. It was a trick‚Äù

The consequences have been devastating, with more than 70 killed and 200 injured.

The journalist emphasizes the tragic loss of life, particularly among children, and the harrowing scenes they have witnessed.

‚ÄúInnocent people took anything from their homes and went to the southern areas and they killed them. They literally killed them. Literally,‚Äù she said, emotionally.

The horror of this reality, she says, is ‚Äúhard to comprehend, and the emotional toll it takes on those living through it is immeasurable.‚Äù

This heartfelt account serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing crisis in Gaza, urging the international community to take immediate action and bring an end to the violence and suffering faced by innocent civilians.",,835,"{'like_count': 831, 'comment_count': 4, 'num_users': 115480}",Roya News English,,2023-10-13 18:50:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/305134148_3407114026278666_8652980037420716560_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=1J1BAqP_zGwAX_w6-o2&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAc1iaO_zhatmjVdaH1JhWmFcDDFz34T9bSj-VcPnen3g&oe=655A1DD5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWYO_prOpS/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391757593_709688227865887_1505751521027561850_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=tvzHDlNH27YAX9IMyre&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBJHQ-DR4O4Cazec2QjnP9T3lLUp89pCgLN2E7cBD8kUQ&oe=6531155C

instagram,"#Swipeleft: The #NYPD is on high alert and has ordered that all officers report in uniform on Friday in anticipation of a worldwide ‚Äúday of rage‚Äù in support of #Palestinians in #Gaza.

The ‚ÄúDay of Rage‚Äù protest was called by #KhaledMeshaal, the former chief of the Hamas terrorist group. This call comes just days into the conflict between Hamas and #Israel. The #Jewish state declared war on Hamas over the weekend after the terrorist group launched a surprise attack, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of civilians.

Reports say that more than 1,200 people, including 25 Americans, have been killed by Hamas since Saturday.

An email obtained by ABC News stated that NYPD officers were instructed to appear in uniform on Friday, October 13, until further notice.

‚ÄúALL UNIFORMED MEMBERS OF THE SERVICE ARE TO PERFORM DUTY IN THE UNIFORM OF THE DAY ‚Äî EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, ALL UNIFORMED MEMBERS OF THE SERVICE, IN EVERY RANK, WILL PERFORM DUTY IN THE UNIFORM OF THE DAY AND BE PREPARED FOR DEPLOYMENT,‚Äù THE DEPARTMENT SAID IN A MESSAGE OBTAINED BY ABC NEWS.

In a recorded video, Meshaal called on neighboring countries to join the fight against Israel.

‚ÄúWE MUST HEAD TO THE SQUARES AND STREETS OF THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC WORLD ON FRIDAY, ‚ÄúMESHAAL SAID IN A RECORDED STATEMENT.¬†

Meshaal, who is based in #Qatar, said that the governments and peoples of #Jordan, #Syria, #Lebanon, and #Egypt have a greater responsibility to support the Palestinians.

instagram,"New Delhi: Before Israel gave just a day‚Äôs notice to 1.1 million Gazans to move out or face bombing, 48 UN human rights independent experts asserted that any violence that indiscriminately targets civilians would amount to a war crime, highlighting that international law has clear rules that define the conduct of any armed conflict.

At around midnight Israel time, the United Nations was notified by Israel that it had 24 hours to evacuate more than a million civilians from the northern half of Gaza. 

It has described the demand as ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù and carrying ‚Äúdevastating humanitarian consequences‚Äù.

The announcement came six days after Hamas fired rockets towards Israel, breached the border and targeted military personnel and civilians, including at a music festival. 

More than 1,300 Israelis and foreign citizens were killed and around 150 people have been taken hostage into Gaza by Hamas.

The UN experts condemned the ‚Äúhorrific crimes‚Äù by Hamas, which included the ‚Äúdeliberate and widespread killing and hostage-taking of innocent civilians, including older persons and children‚Äù.

""I think for peacemaking it is so important that we are home, that we know to whom we belong. Jesus says it very clearly; he says: ‚ÄúYou do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. Therefore, I am sending you into the world as my Father has sent me into the world.‚Äù You have to catch the paradox: that we can really be in the world, involved in the world, and actively engaged in the world precisely because we do not belong to it, precisely because that is not where our dwelling place is. Precisely because our home is in God, we can be in the world, and speak words of healing, of confrontation, of invitation, and of challenge."" - Henri Nouwen

We have been processing our shock and grief at the atrocious terrorist attacks by Hamas, the devastating loss of life, and the continued anguish and worry for the safety of the hostages. We are heartbroken for the innocent Israeli and Palestinian families who are suffering from historical trauma, current violence, and palpable dread for what is to come.‚Å†
‚Å†
Here in our own Bay Area community, we anticipate that recent events may lead to a spike of antisemitism and Islamophobia. Since its inception, The Contemporary Jewish Museum has upheld Jewish life and culture, carried it out into the wider world, and taught ways to work against prejudice to build a world free of intolerance. As school groups entered The Museum these past few days, we continued to engage in important conversations with young people about how Jewish culture can foster belonging, empathy, and acceptance of others.‚Å†
‚Å†
In this dark moment, as we process the horrible trauma, we open our hearts and find connection through our shared humanity. Art and community can offer some comfort during times of immense challenge and heartache. To provide a space for respite, we are opening our doors for free this weekend, and we invite you to come and spend time in community at The CJM. ‚Å†
‚Å†
At The Museum, we work to manifest a world free of hatred and bigotry, one in which people of all backgrounds and identities may flourish.

NEW DELHI: Glad to be home and traumatised by what they had seen in the last few days, the first batch of over 200 Indians returned from Israel on Friday with the sound of air raid sirens, rocket fire and screams ringing loud in their ears. Israel witnessed a surprise and unprecedented attack by Hamas in its southern parts on Saturday morning. 

At least 700 people have been killed and more than 2,100 injured in Israel the deadliest day for the country in at least 50 years. 

 ""We woke up to sounds of air raid sirens. We stay in central Israel and I don't know what shape this conflict will take,"" said Shashwat Singh soon after landing at Delhi airport along with his wife. 

 The post-doctoral researcher in agriculture, who has been staying in Israel since 2019, said the sound of those sirens and the nightmarish experience of the past few days still haunt him.

instagram,"Last Saturday (7 Oct), Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. In response, Israel declared a state of war and has since launched air strikes against Gaza with plans for a ground assault.

As of Wednesday noon (11 Oct), at least 950 deaths in Gaza and over 1200 deaths in Israel were reported. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) reports that nearly 200 000 people in Gaza have been displaced.

‚ÄúThe most recent violence does not come in a vacuum. The reality is that it grows out of a longstanding conflict, with a 56-year old occupation and no political end in sight.‚Äù ‚Äî UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres. 

There are people dying from both sides of the war. So as you look to the news to form your opinions on the matter, please remember that human loss of life has always been used by governments to justify aggressive political or military action, and that more often than not, civilian losses outweigh military ones. If escalating violence continues to be the only way forward, then this will just be another incident in a pattern for years to come.

The hospital will have ten beds and will be accompanied by a dispensary. 

Al-Alam noted that the movement of people leaving the area has become sporadic and is primarily directed towards Beirut, where most residents have homes.

He clarified that the initiative is not in coordination with the Lebanese Army or UNIFIL but is a local effort involving the municipality, civil society, and the Lebanese Red Cross in Rmeish.

instagram,"‚úÖPolitico just published a report that Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned a small group of lawmakers last week that his department is tracking the possibility that Azerbaijan could soon invade Armenia, according to two people familiar with the conversation.

The call indicates the depth of concern in the administration about Azerbaijan‚Äôs operations against a breakaway region in the west of the country and the possibility of the conflict spreading. Azerbaijiani President Ilham Aliyev has previously called on Armenia to open a ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù along its southern border, linking mainland Azerbaijan to an exclave that borders Turkey and Iran. Aliyev has threatened to solve the issue ‚Äúby force.‚Äù
In an Oct. 3 phone call, lawmakers pressed Blinken on possible measures against Aliyev in response to his country‚Äôs invasion of the Nagorno-Karabakh region in September, the people said, who were granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive call.

Blinken responded that the State Department was looking at avenues to hold Azerbaijan accountable and isn‚Äôt planning to renew a long-standing waiver that allows the U.S. to provide military assistance to Baku. He added that State saw a possibility that Azerbaijan would invade southern Armenia in the coming weeks.

Still, Blinken expressed confidence about ongoing diplomatic talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan to the Democratic lawmakers, among them Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Anna Eshoo of California, and Frank Pallone of New Jersey.

Two additional people confirmed that a briefing happened on the situation in Azerbaijan, but did not provide details.

instagram,"On Thursday, Oct. 12, Tritons for Israel, partnered with UCSD Hillel, SDSU Hillel, Chabad UCSD, and SDSU Students Supporting Israel, hosted a walk for Israeli solidarity in front of Geisel Library at 12 p.m.

Later that same day, Students for Justice in Palestine at UC San Diego hosted a vigil called Honor Our Martyrs at 6 p.m. in front of Geisel Library, alongside the Palestinian Youth Movement, SJP at SDSU, and Palestine Solidarity Committee at University of San Diego.

Both events come after a series of attacks in Israel from Hamas, a political and militant organization from Palestine. Starting early Saturday, Hamas is said to be responsible for firing on Israeli civilians in communities near the Gaza strip and abducting an unknown number of people. 

This led to Israel‚Äôs declaration of war on Hamas, an escalation of 75 years of Israeli subjugation of Palestine. The Israeli military stated that they have largely regained control of areas attacked by Hamas members. It has continued a siege and heavy bombing of the Gaza Strip. Israel has also cut off water, food, fuel, Internet access, and energy to the city of Gaza in Palestine and its 2.3 million civilians. 

Students who may be struggling with mental health during this difficult time are encouraged to reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services. Employees, staff, and postdocs can contact the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program at (858)534-3755. For more resources and support for those affected by the conflict, refer to the Resources and Support page from UC San Diego Today.

instagram,"every facet of our mission here at The Conversationalist is driven by one fundamental belief: that our shared humanity is more powerful than any form of hate or division.

as we've witnessed in horror the acts of Hamas and the suffering and terror that continues to unfold in Israel and Gaza - the brutal escalation of a conflict that has inflicted violence against civilians across the region for decades - this belief can feel further from our reality than ever, but that's also why it‚Äôs never been more important to hold onto.

no matter your religion, race, background, upbringing, nationality, culture, or political beliefs, it‚Äôs imperative that we resist retreating into hate or misunderstanding and instead come together to recognize that no person or group of people should be denied their humanity in this way. this has always been true and will always be true. when we ignore this truth ‚Äî or worse, attempt to justify the opposite ‚Äî history repeats itself. it can stop with us. it has to stop with us.

there‚Äôs no easy way to do this, but there are ways we can try. we have to meet each other as human beings first. we have to listen, not just consume. we have to remember that we are all entering conversations with perspectives shaped by our unique backgrounds, lived experiences, and level of knowledge on the issues at hand. we have to remember that misinformation is rampant. we have to remember that there are gray areas in most conversations and situations. we have to remember that encouraging the elimination of other human beings is never one of them.

for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know where to start when it comes to these conversations, but feels ready to have them - we‚Äôve shared some tips above we‚Äôve found helpful as we navigate this, too. 

please share any additional conversation tips in the comments. for anyone who is trying to start a conversation from a place of justification for violence against any person or group of people, rather than human empathy or understanding, we are not hosting or participating in that discourse right now.

Conflict in the Middle East can often be traced to the First World War. Lines were drawn, treaties written, promises were made then and since ‚Äì often without the participation of the very people and lands that they purported to help. A century later, we witness the ongoing suffering of millions of innocent people. The enduring impact of the Great War includes unintended consequences.

At the National WWI Museum and Memorial we seek to provide a forum for discussion and debate about the enduring impact of the Great War. We firmly believe there is no better path to understanding than by learning.

instagram,"1/3 üá≤üáæ ‚Ä¢ Israel-Palestine Conflict Sparks Demonstrations Across Region

Malaysian Muslim activists and Palestinian nationals gather to express solidarity with the people of Palestine as they march towards the US Embassy¬†after Friday prayers on October 13, 2023 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Malaysians gathered to protest in solidarity with the Palestinians in the wake of the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 

On October 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched the largest surprise attack from Gaza in a generation, sending thousands of missiles and an unknown number of fighters by land, who shot and kidnapped Israelis in communities near the Gaza border. The attack prompted retaliatory strikes on Gaza and a declaration of war by the Israeli prime minister.

instagram,"It‚Äôs with absolute horror, revulsion and a deep deep sadness that I‚Äôve watched the events of the past few days unfold in the Middle East. It takes me back to nearly 20 years ago when I witnessed first hand the unfolding 2006 war with Hezbollah. Having graduated in a degree for War Studies and History I naively took myself off to witness the real thing. What I saw was a country unite and fight in an uncompromising manor. This latest war however I imagine will be on a completely different level. The desire for revenge will be so great that it is hard to see how this will end. Israel is in the unenviable position of trying to eradicate a movement born out of trauma, hatred and desire for revenge, that is right on its doorstep. How you do this without furthering that idea through collective punishment and collateral damage seems difficult to imagine. I‚Äôve always had a deep sympathy for the Palestinian cause; having witnessed the dehumanising policies that have furthered their pain and humiliation, but I also fully respect Israel‚Äôs need for security and the right to exist - the balance for all of that takes real leadership. The events of the past few days have knocked all of this off kilter for at least another few generations. My sympathies lie with all of those caught up in it.

instagram,"Now that the proverbial smoke has cleared, and I've laid a ground floor for my contextual reasons for my opposition to the Israeli/ Palestine issues unfolding on the Gaza Strip. It seemed fitting to unveil some dark satire of how folks are sounding to me these days.

Especially the ""woke Jesus"" slide. God never condones Christians to slay others in His name. This mentality is but an offshoot of a Crusaders' mentality of ""Deus Vault!"" (""God wills it!"") before rushing into battle to slay innocent bystanders. Why? The reasons are always numerous and justified, to spare family members' souls from purgatory if you slay an infidel for the Catholic church. To reclaim the ""Holy Land"" from the Saracens and give it to ""Christians."" To eradicate ""terrorists"" from these barbaric people. To protect God's ""chosen people.""

The list goes on and on, and the lies and narratives adapt. But one thing remains certain, wars in the Middle East grieve God's heart. The Talmud j-ws forged Catholicisms early roots under Emperor Constantine. Catholicism, in turn, then created Islam, as a modern Rabbi, phrased it as, ""Islam is the broom of Israel."" Basically, send in their ethnicity to create populous dissent, then come in as the shining knights in armor to restore order. 

Most folks don't seem to realize that the Old Testament promise to Abram is not applicable to present-day Israel. Rather, the parasites who claim their ethnicity to that region use it as a ploy to manipulate sympathy from Christian dupes to fight their battles. Then, when called out for what they truly are, they pull the ""antisemitic"" veil over their heads. The equivalent analogy of a bully once confronted saying, ""You wouldn't hit a kid with glasses, would you?"" 

Christians, if we're joint heirs according to Abrams' promise,...doesn't that make us as equals? I'm not sure how many times Christians need to hear this verse, but again, 

""For there is neither j-w nor Greek, neither slave nor free, nor male or female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."" - Gal. 3:28

instagram,"‚Ä¢ @momwell - Do you ever feel like having a baby changed your relationship completely‚Äìand not in a good way? 
 
You‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs common for couples to face more conflict and dissatisfaction after a baby is born. 
 
In fact, 67% of couples report a decline in their relationship satisfaction during the first three years of their baby‚Äôs life.* 
 
There are many reasons why new parents often feel dissatisfied: 
 
„Ä∞ Both partners are transitioning into their new roles, which can be difficult. 
„Ä∞ They're sleep-deprived, making them both more irritable and less able to navigate conflict. 
„Ä∞ They are often overstimulated and overwhelmed with new parental responsibilities. 
„Ä∞ They might not see eye-to-eye on parenting decisions or how to adapt to life with a child. 
„Ä∞ Having children comes with new responsibilities and mental labor, which might not be shared fairly. 
 
It‚Äôs no wonder so many new parents are struggling! Navigating these changes takes skills‚Äìskills that so many of us were never taught. 
 
But the good news is that we CAN learn them. We don‚Äôt have to live in conflict and resentment.

instagram,"We hijsen in Gent de vredesvlag. Het geweld in het conflict Isra√´l-Palestina is onaanvaardbaar. Vandaag is er maar 1 kant te kiezen: die van het internationaal recht, tegen het geweld tegen Isra√´lische en Palestijnse burgers. De aanvallen zijn gruwelijk en daders moeten verantwoordelijk gesteld worden. Geweld tegen burgers is nooit te rechtvaardigen, wat de historische en geopolitieke omstandigheden ook zijn.

We roepen Belgische en Europese leiders op om te pleiten voor de-escalatie, het respecteren van mensenrechten en het internationaal humanitair recht opdat dit bloedvergieten stopt. We geloven in de kracht van diplomatieke oplossingen. Dat is de enige uitweg in de spiraal van geweld.

instagram,"This is our proudly Jewish-blended family with dear ones on both sides of the conflict and a call for peace.

Jews make up a smaller percentage of the population than many realize. Most sources put the global Jewish population at 16 million. To put that into pop culture context, Kim Kardashian has 22x more followers on Instagram than there are Jews living worldwide.

For that reason, an attack on Jews ripples from the head to the toe of our global community in a heartbeat. 

I share that information with non-Jews in the hope of explaining why attacks are felt so profoundly & as anyone who has felt truly othered may understand. 

And still, calls to stand with Israel are not compelling to our family. I would never&will never pledge my loyalty to a state. Stateheads do not represent the collective best interest as is laid bare in the horrific events unfolding right now. 

Here is who I will fight like hell for - mothers having their babies ripped from their arms, women whose bodily autonomy is sacrificed as a bargaining chip in wars they didn‚Äôt ask for, young people who deserve to grow up freely and safely. I care not what God you pray to nor what country issues your passport.

I will fight like hell for anyone who is living with a boot on their neck. Horrifically, this happens everywhere from right outside my doorstep to half way across the world. 

A thought I cannot get over: according to reports, two weeks ago 2,000 Israeli& Palestinian women gathered in a show of solidarity and to demand that women be given a seat at the negotiating table - these women are fighting for peace.

Put women at the table who speak the universal language of living in a world not made for us; put women at the table who would never rip a child from another woman‚Äôs arms knowing she could never perpetrate that kind of violence from mother to mother; put women at the table who would never trap another family as bombs are dropped on their homes with borders blocked; put women at the table who would never see another woman raped. 

Put women at the table. 

Our hearts break for each dear, sweet, beloved human life at risk. Where is our humanity?

instagram,"The fire burned all night from the smoking tree, alone on the floodplain, burnt every season but alive. Anxiety burns inside us like a fire in the heart of a tree; unfamiliar and life-threatening. The heartwood is dead and dry, hard as steel, it‚Äôs the unconscious isolated from the entirely undefinable something which is everything. In looking out upon the world, we forget that the world is looking upon itself. You are the soul that is threatened in this tree.

For the ego exists as an abstraction from memory, like a long exposure of a fire burning in a tree beyond reality, immortalized. Like a photo, the past from which our ego is gains meaning has disappeared entirely. Actions guided by ego are doomed to frustration in a false image of yourself. Self-conscious, dualistic, and insecure, you can‚Äôt let go of yourself as you search for certainty and security in a city designed to control you.

You burn inside with stress and anxiety as you exist in between not doing what you are doing and wanting to do what you aren‚Äôt doing. You feel that you shouldn‚Äôt be what you are, and want to be what you aren‚Äôt. When attempting to exert power over someone else, you can‚Äôt avoid giving them power over you. Actions according to ego give your power away from you in the compulsive desire to control and guarantee.

A fire shouldn‚Äôt be burning in the heart of this tree. Spontaneity isn‚Äôt a blind, disorderly impulse or disorder. Driven by ego, the language and convention of modern society can‚Äôt imagine an intelligence that doesn‚Äôt work according to plan, that flows uncontrolled, connected with everything without ordered thought. The tree was meant to burn, spontaneously. Cultivating spontaneity helps us recognize anxiety as our natural reaction to ego.

There is no duality, no conflict between natural spontaneity and human control. Our constructive and destructive powers are the formative, spontaneous actions of trees, bees, and all life. We shouldn‚Äôt be trying to control everything. The root of unrecognizable anxiety, the fire burning in our hearts as the darkness approaches, is an abstraction of ego in memory that consumes our identity and halts serendipity.

instagram,"Maps and key takeaways from our 12 OCT Iran update covering the war in #Israel:

1. #Hamas continued rocket attacks from the #Gaza Strip into southern Israel but reduced the rate of these attacks.

2. Small arms clashes between Palestinian militants and Israeli forces increased slightly across the #WestBank, as Palestinian militias try to stoke conflict there.

3. CTP-ISW recorded three rocket strikes into Israeli territory from #Lebanon.

4. Unidentified Iranian officials implicitly threatened to direct proxy attacks against US forces in #Iraq and #Syria if the United States re-freezes Iranian financial assets abroad.

5. Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian is conducting a diplomatic tour to Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria, possibly to coordinate politically with senior leaders in the Axis of Resistance.

6. #Iran is conducting a diplomatic campaign to unite Muslim countries against Israel.

instagram,"There are moments when we feel like outsiders, disconnected from the world as a whole. We observe how people can turn against one another for the sake of power, and we question why God doesn't intervene despite the majority of us praying for harmony. I contemplated this during my morning meditation, and here is what I discovered:

As a collective, we have stopped caring. Some individuals feel powerless, others are too self-absorbed, and there are those who have become desensitized or overwhelmed by the pain and suffering we witness through the news - the wars, crimes, and violence that plague our world.

It is essential to remember that every thought, word, and action we take contributes to the unfolding of the universe. We are active participants in this ever-evolving world, and everything we perceive has been shaped by the collective consciousness of humanity.

These are crucial moments we are living in. The world, as we once knew it, has been disrupted once again by terrorism and the senseless killing of innocent people,  in both side of this horrific story, who share the same dreams and aspirations for themselves and their children.

Our world may be divided, but it doesn't have to be. Darkness thrives in a divided world, and predators prey on the weak. Nothing occurs by chance. Everything in the universe exists in harmony, except for humanity, as we have forgotten how to love one another. The transformation of our collective consciousness begins with each individual.

Take a moment to ask yourself: Am I currently feeling insulted, angry, upset, or harboring dislike towards someone? If your answer is yes, then you are contributing to the cosmic energy of conflict in the world.  How can we expect the world to change if we cannot change ourselves?

Prayers for peace cannot be heard if there is no peace within our own hearts. I understand that for many of us, especially given the current state of the world, letting go of these negative emotions will be incredibly challenging. However, peace for the masses begins with individual forgiveness. Namaste. #peace #nomorebloodshed #protectheinnocent  #peaceforisraelandpalestineüïäÔ∏è",,446,"{'like_count': 386, 'comment_count': 60, 'num_users': 99905}",Shino Bay Aguilera,,2023-10-13 12:43:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/354532836_122341924215459_736806871805807347_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AeIG3oxtwOQAX-ZMieh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAkPmQUBNR9CcuhjI9Qsnr2CCm56SAbqtqLQZQo5nmvyQ&oe=655B6450,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyVuNSwry2n/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387823621_2555895001250503_5473422666022727804_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=FaXNyKJYOVwAX8I6Ff1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB3bF5D_hzLctC0GR_OMZ2QnV0qQo-s9iDeYxfL-BjGAw&oe=6547EF36

The United Arab Emirates has launched a campaign to provide relief aid to the Palestinian people impacted by the war in the Gaza Strip, under the theme ‚ÄòTarahum - for Gaza‚Äô.

The campaign will establish centers to collect and mobilize humanitarian relief packages in partnership with humanitarian and charitable institutions, volunteer centers, the private sector, media and all segments of society. As part of the humanitarian efforts undertaken by the UAE to provide urgent assistance to the Palestinian people, the relief campaign is in cooperation with the World Food Program, and in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Community Development.

Moreover, in solidarity with the Palestinian children and families affected by the ongoing conflict, the ‚ÄòTarahum - for Gaza‚Äô campaign aims to mitigate the severity of the humanitarian conditions, and alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable groups, especially children, who constitute nearly half of the population of the Gaza Strip. More than one million children are affected by the current conflict, and the campaign will work towards providing children and mothers with basic needs, in addition to health supplies and general hygiene materials.

The campaign will be inaugurated on Sunday, 15th October 2023, in Abu Dhabi, under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent at the Abu Dhabi Ports Hall in Mina Zayed from 9 am - 4 pm, and will be organized across the rest of the Emirates at a later date.

„ÄêICRC calls on all parties to respect IHL„Äë
In the past few days, five members of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement have tragically lost their lives, including four Palestinian Red Crescent Society paramedics and one ambulance driver of Magen David Adom in Israel. They were attacked while providing humanitarian assistance.

In response to the urgent situation in Israel and the Gaza Strip, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) urged all parties involved in the conflict to comply with their legal obligations under International Humanitarian Law (IHL).

The ICRC has been present in Israel and the Occupied Territories since 1967, and taken immediate actions to provide emergency and critical humanitarian aid, including transfer medical supplies to a hospital in Gaza, operate ambulance services and collect over 13,000 units of blood, etc.",,440,"{'like_count': 439, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 10599}",È¶ôÊ∏ØÁ¥ÖÂçÅÂ≠óÊúÉ Hong Kong Red Cross,,2023-10-13 11:35:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/369297201_969797860740845_4592965020590053046_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ypBhWnMzNEUAX97EEAq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCE3VQpa0HpU95r0XUIZNnV7Xs_sJA3aciobNP2XVtKXg&oe=655AF5E5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyVmfK9RXlu/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/387801990_719431370226614_582668245323079073_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=jsDwa6QRRyAAX8-aAJ6&_nc_oc=AQlY8X2_wTketm5iLSc6bxgFU4iOzvwBzKGf8vQOr0VvltoD-s7_BMXe2uEz_8QiZnw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBctQ7lt1w5ejHPFhIEx4fE-io1oEyUeBncgQFA36wpmg&oe=65543C3F
instagram,"As the world reels from recent terrorist attacks launched by Hamas and the Israeli military action unfolding in Gaza, and our friends and colleagues feel their impacts, we‚Äôre reflecting on how we can do better, collectively, in the pursuit of peace.

How can we do more to reject the politics of ‚Äúus‚Äù vs. ‚Äúthem‚Äù that lead us further down the path of fear and division? How can we resist hate, racism, antisemitism and Islamophobia? How can we help each other better understand the context of this conflict and the long struggle for universal rights and freedom that continues today?

We ask these questions because the only way to realize a world where all human beings live free and equal, in dignity and rights, is through embracing our shared humanity, engaging in dialogue and ensuring mutual respect and recognition.

On the ground, Israeli and Palestinian peacemakers have long worked to build bridges, defend their collective human rights and secure a peaceful resolution of this longstanding conflict. That same work also happens here in Canada. It is that work, those people and their remarkable accomplishments over decades that we uplift today.

They are examples to all of us why we cannot afford to decide there are problems so complex that there is nothing to do but throw up our hands, absolve ourselves of responsibility and walk away.

We know the rush to show support & bring awareness to the atrocities taking place in Israel and Gaza right now is motivated by a genuine love for others (on our corner of the Internet, at least).

instagram,"I spent nearly a week thinking about what to say. I, like many of you have been deeply impacted and affected by the horrific and tragic events from last weekend. The honest raw vulnerable truth is that I have never felt so unsure about what to say. I‚Äôm jewish, but not super religious, but this is about humanity. For me, social media is a great tool to spread positivity, inspirational nuggets, mindset and connect with other like minded humans. I‚Äôm a believer in humanity even though at times I‚Äôm let down. I admittedly and by design, don‚Äôt watch too much of the news so I don‚Äôt know every detail of the conflict in the middle east. But what I do know is this. I am heartbroken, upset, angry and at times feel paralyzed and my thoughts and prayers go out to all the innocent people who have lost their lives and who have suffered a loss as a result of this situation. Everyone to some degree is impacted by this awful situation. This week in my Kabbalah class we spent the entire class discussing what‚Äôs going on in Israel and how we feel, what we can do, and just all the things about this heartbreaking and awful situation. And our teacher said aside from the physical stuff such as donating, sending Zohar‚Äôs to Isreali solders and so forth, the most important thing that we can do is to identify the hatred and darkness inside ourselves, because weather we want to admit it or not everyone has some, and then correct it and turn it into light and love. This is so that as a whole collective consciousness we can create more light and less hate and prevent events like this from happening again. I would also suggest to be super intentional with the news, and footage that you consume. It‚Äôs important to see the horror that is going on, but to a degree. Exercise kindness. Remove negativity. Work on becoming the best version of you. If everyone just committed to that, then we can create the world we truly want to see. It starts within each of us. Be the light and contribute to creating more light. Thats our responsibility.

instagram,"As many American Jews remain focused on mourning the 1,300 Israelis killed in the attack by Hamas Saturday ‚Äî and on crushing the terrorist organization‚Äôs infrastructure in Gaza ‚Äî Palestinian Americans are wracked with fear for their families and frustration with the U.S. government, which is sending military aid to Israel.

Israeli forces have killed 1,800 Palestinians and left 400,000 homeless, according to local officials. The Israeli military told Palestinians living in the northern Gaza Strip, where more than one million people live, to evacuate south Friday.

While many Palestinian Americans have long been frustrated with their government‚Äôs approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, feeling that it has been biased in favor of Israel, they said that imbalance feels especially extreme following the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians.

Israel has said it is seeking to destroy Hamas and pressure the terrorist group to free dozens of hostages kidnapped Saturday. Military officials said they were aiming only at legitimate targets but acknowledged they had abandoned the doctrine of ""surgical"" strikes used to limit civilian casualties in past Gaza conflicts.

""I wish I could say that taking measures to stay safe is something that is applicable here,‚Äù said Dorgham Abusalim, a communications professional in Washington, D.C. whose parents are in Gaza. ""The reality is there is no safety to be found anywhere in the Gaza Strip.""

instagram,"Pay attention to the words used. 'But' keeps us problem focused and in the past, whereas AND has the potential to shift the forces and/or narrative to be future focused and solution oriented. 

Because perspectives clash, finding common ground may feel like an impossible task. The ongoing conflict has given rise to coutless debates, leaving us standing at the crossroads of frustration, anger, betrayal and confusion. But amidst the chaos and disagreements, there lies a truth that unites most: the condemnation of the loss of innocent lives.

Inspired by the resilience of those affected, we must come together, engage in meaningful dialogue, and forge a path towards peace by finding the root cause and the right perpetrators: the sponsors of terror. Let us transcend the boundaries of blame and awaken our collective consciousness to the urgency of this situation. It is not enough to cast our sorrowful glances from a distance; now is the moment to ask ourselves, ""What can we do to fix it?""

The key lies in embracing the transformative power of unity. By recognizing the humanity that exists within each individual, regardless of their nationality or background, we open doors to breaking down barriers and building bridges. It is through understanding and compassion that we can dismantle the walls of ignorance and pave the way for a brighter future.

Our duty extends beyond mere empathy; it demands action. Let us not underestimate the power we each possess as individuals, for it is within our reach to make a difference. Educate yourself about the complexities of the situation, share information to raise awareness and contact local representatives. Let us never forget that every life lost is a piercing reminder of our responsibility to strive for a world where peace, justice, and understanding prevail.",,412,"{'like_count': 397, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 127861}",Dr Samineh Shaheem/Psychology/Speaker,,2023-10-13 22:28:21,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/305685523_1118385358765766_1422729728586506058_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=2wdd66VDBIEAX_d1tar&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBvGtAWeUHHqVGGeNwAapSijBZjBvNeaV7ACOnq-NSp3A&oe=655ACC5F,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWxMfWIMtk/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391355734_333656445835267_3390218745505622522_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=sEoGhNAMjwAAX_04C7m&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDW6gTOZ9nenpk3EWVHZJKisq5_bRPPgDpM6-op0iZFow&oe=655A33E4

You attack her family, you attack mine. 

She suggested jgive.com. I donated to their National Emergency Fund. (Tip: Change the site to English in the upper left dropdown, and $s).

instagram,"The African lion is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list of threatened species - their population has decreased by 75% in just five decades. Increasing human populations reduce available lion habitat, leading to a rise in human-lion conflict. Science and research are essential if we are to preserve future lion populations.

The @‚Äåsactrust (SACT), @tkpp_wildcru (TKPP) and Nelson Mandela University require GPS satellite collars to track the natural movement of lions between protected areas and develop lion management plans. These collars provide data to computer simulations that allow TKPP to monitor lion prides situated on park boundaries. They also provide an early-warning system to local communities about the whereabouts of lions and allow them to react quickly to potential problems and avoid human-lion conflict.

Find out more about sponsoring a lion collar and what your sponsorship will include under the 'Collar a lion' tab in our bio link.

The deliberate targeting of civilians is an international crime and always wrong. Any escalation will have devastating humanitarian consequences.

Across the world, from Sudan, to Tigray to the Middle East, civilians, particularly women and girls, are facing devastating consequence of violence and conflict. We ask all parties to uphold international law.

I am deeply concerned for the innocent people on both sides of this conflict. I fear for a massacre of the innocent Palestinians. Not all of them support Hamas. I am worried that people are not well informed. There is a lot happening rather quickly. It‚Äôs sometimes difficult to know where the truth lies. News travels fast these days in the age of social media. We have already learned this is an easy way to receive fake news. I urge everyone to exercise caution here. Hamas is the enemy. Not all Palestinians support Hamas. It‚Äôs important we know the difference. 

I pray for the innocent people of Israel who have been subjected to this hate that has gone on for far too long now. It‚Äôs unacceptable to me. Something must be done to combat that. It‚Äôs how that is done that concerns me as a ground war seems all but inevitable at this point. I can not help but consider the innocent Palestinians, who don‚Äôt support Hamas nor have hate towards the Jews. These people are literally and figuratively caught in this middle here.

 I hate wars because too often innocent people become victims and that doesn‚Äôt sit well in my heart. I wish I had the answers, however, the truth is I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure my thoughts here will matter to anyone else, yet I felt the need to express them nonetheless. I hope you don‚Äôt mind and more importantly I hope you don‚Äôt take offense to my sentiments. It‚Äôs certainly not what I want to happen and yet to be honest it‚Äôs a fear I have as I prepare to let go of this statement.  My intentions are good ones and I certainly hope it comes across that way to everyone who has taken the time to read this üôè‚ù§Ô∏è",,331,"{'like_count': 286, 'comment_count': 45, 'num_users': 17415}",John Gomes,,2023-10-13 16:15:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/90091725_642942526528576_7710460125982490624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=k1cqYRoqyucAX_Q3NGN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDoBlbVk71_T8dlqhU4_P6MAgzj3D8elgJvGX_YTuz-Fg&oe=655ABFB5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWGgTROtQz/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391119624_338766308528137_6504531939545463227_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=z3qhwQmG_7YAX8UH31Q&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAWAoGH-hdy7UGy4CYZFNzSv5vZpXNTSrUccOBb61vsIg&oe=65596005
instagram,"Workshop on ‚ÄòMatrix of JustPeace‚Äô at Patkai

Patkai:

The Department of Mass Communication, Patkai Christian College (Autonomous) organised a workshop on ‚ÄúMatrix of JustPeace‚Äù on Friday, October 13 with Dr. Ak√ºm Longchari, peace and conflict activist and publisher/editor of The Morung Express, as resource person.

During the day-long workshop, Dr. Longchari engaged the students in several exercises as he broke down concepts of conflict, power, power dynamics, how it manifests in society, peace, justice, and JustPeace.

He pointed out that most nation-state approach peace from a security perspective and so there is a lot of investments on defence and law enforcement whereas there is little investment in peace studies. ‚ÄúIf there is a need to approach peace from a security perspective, it should be from a human security perspective,‚Äù he asserted.

Dr. Longchari said that conflict affects four dimensions of life ‚Äî personal, relational, structures and culture. When there is a conflict, it changes the person, their relationships, existing structures and their attitudes and behaviours, he explained. 

He argued that to achieve JustPeace, one should look at truth, mercy, justice and peace as the anchor points.",,329,"{'like_count': 329, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 456}","Dept of Mass Communication, PCC",,2023-10-13 14:40:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/57239239_396139417608816_383283950941896704_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=xrEmIzzWy9kAX_a-_ky&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA0sZZn74CauCAf27tP8bl2KRqWtRScql7OwbGF3dkgUQ&oe=655ABEF9,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyV7ncqP-RT/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387798780_2013648662353658_6427521018653412029_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=kyQi7aGFPQ4AX_vi3FF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC8angtt5uVzUTKDSPb3yifWdL5vYnGbQC4eQOERq1wiw&oe=655812B8
instagram,"The Iranian Foreign Minister, Hussein Amir Abdullahian, issued a warning from Beirut, indicating that the ongoing Israeli attacks against Palestinians will not go unanswered. He mentioned that crimes against Palestinians could trigger a response from other factions, referring to them as the ""rest of the axis,"" with Israel bearing responsibility for the consequences.
This statement suggests the possibility of an escalation of an already tense situation, including the potential for opening new fronts in the conflict, particularly in Lebanon. 
Abdullahian's arrival in Beirut was welcomed by representatives of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, and representatives of Hezbollah and the Amal Movement.
Meanwhile, Abdullahian met with the acting Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, today, where he called for maintaining calm and security in Lebanon. Mikati, in turn, emphasized the need for all parties to make diplomatic efforts to stop the events in Gaza and protect Lebanon.",,326,"{'like_count': 317, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 11704}",PolyBlog,,2023-10-13 19:19:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/143905869_243823470650106_5332666147040290861_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=LZ-AOIhlz98AX-m68_W&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCg_6pBDVlGc32k5JvtfYR5KtgP6lQxxD8zZDgHdVAo_w&oe=655A6127,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWblsBMWn5/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391033981_729324832376149_120657288276021830_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=YSdacJkkCmwAX_gLd2q&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfC3DIFME1B_UGS1d0qdIJbNaUKhGtVnpIFxsKj2Ih7W_w&oe=6547156C

From New York to London, St. Louis to Sydney, Jewish communities are grappling with hate and bigotry that often flare up whenever the Middle East erupts.‚Å†

""It's just a sad fact that whenever conflict arises between Israel and the Palestinians, Jews in all parts of the world will suffer some level of hate violence,"" said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.‚Å†

instagram,"Hyderabad, Oct 13 (IANS) A group of women students staging a protest to express solidarity with Palestinians here on Friday, were detained by police.

Raising slogans denouncing Israel for its bombardment of Gaza, they gathered at B. R. Ambedkar statue near Tank Bund in the heart of the city.

They were carrying a placard reading ""Long live Palestine"".

The police detained the protestors who were raising slogans ""down down Israel"". The police personnel were seen taking away the protestors in a police vehicle.

A police officer said there was no permission for the protest. This was the first protest in Hyderabad since the latest conflict between Israel and Palestine began last week.

Activists have condemned the police action. ""The shrinking spaces for protests in Telangana is a indication of police authoritarianism in Telangana,"" wrote Srinivas Kodali on 'X' (formerly Twitter).

instagram,"ü¶í This is the last weekend to see Brett's 'Zoo' and 'Christie' series before they go for a break.

The ‚ÄòZoo‚Äô and ‚ÄòChristie‚Äô series were developed in London between 1964 and 1965 and show Brett‚Äôs interest in the duality of the human psyche: the conflicting and coexisting animal instinct and human rationality. The caged animals in the London Zoo inspired the first series, and the creepy accounts of the serial murders committed by John Christie in London between January and March 1953 were the subject of the latter body of work. The current display brings this conversation/conflict to life once again; a unique opportunity for visitors to revisit Brett‚Äôs interests during those days.

After this weekend, the smaller gallery space on the Studio's ground floor will receive a changeover, and between 19 October and 26 November the space will showcase this year's Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship recipient and finalist works.

The rest of 'Chapters 1959‚Äì69' ‚Äì the Studio's current exhibition ‚Äì will remain on display during the Scholarship's show.

We are open Thursday ‚Äì Sunday between 10am and 4pm with free entry. Come along this weekend for Brett's early works, then return from 19 Oct to see the new generation of Australian painters.

Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican‚Äôs secretary of state, condemned Hamas‚Äô Saturday terrorist attacks against Israel, called for peace in the Holy Land, and said the Vatican is ready to help mediate a peace agreement, in an¬†interview¬†published by Vatican News Friday. 

Parolin told Vatican News that the Hamas attacks were ‚Äúinhuman,‚Äù and that the Holy See expresses ‚Äúcomplete and firm condemnation.‚Äù¬† 

He also expressed the Vatican‚Äôs concern for the civilians in Gaza and the ‚Äúmen, women, children, and the elderly held hostage.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt is necessary,‚Äù Parolin said, ‚Äúto regain a sense of reason, abandon the blind logic of hatred, and reject violence as a solution. It is the right of those who are attacked to defend themselves, but even legitimate defense must respect the parameter of proportionality.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do not know how much room for dialogue there can be between Israel and the Hamas militia,‚Äù Parolin said. ‚ÄúBut if there is ‚Äî and we hope there is ‚Äî it should be pursued immediately and without delay.‚Äù He said that the Holy See is ‚Äúready for any necessary mediation.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe greatest possible justice in the Holy Land,‚Äù Parolin claimed, ‚Äúis the two-state solution, which would allow Palestinians and Israelis to live side by side in peace and security, meeting the aspirations of the majority.‚Äù

""However, any mediation to end the conflict must take into account a series of elements that make the issue very complex and articulated, such as the issue of Israeli settlements, security, and the issue of the city of Jerusalem,"" he said. 

‚ÄúA solution can be found in direct dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis, encouraged and supported by the international community, even though it will be more difficult now,‚Äù Parolin said. Parolin also expressed special concern for the Christians in Israel and in the Gaza Strip.¬†

‚ÄúChristians are an essential part of the land where Jesus was born, lived, died, and rose again,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo one can imagine Palestine or Israel without a Christian presence, which has been there from the beginning and will be there forever.‚Äù (Read more below)",,298,"{'like_count': 284, 'comment_count': 14, 'num_users': 3877}",Ethan's Rosaries,,2023-10-13 18:26:53,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/118995661_350830716300272_7187875849627287659_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=f0xlV0DcyqAAX9iNQnz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB2rkyf145oo5RzKmUORvIBaKMP5zDZQRkZrJTn34ktEQ&oe=655B0BD5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWVj-1LhDk/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391132189_632589905713508_4952594562522346539_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=t828yU55GYEAX_NxvVF&_nc_oc=AQkArBCmwoODbberqxnCPwIqk_XGvY5jojj5woceoJljd_MYhr5McPLbKKw9MuBSK1k&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBNHE11vodCzX3iE3Rn3a3QmddMp_5z2PYux8V8vDCq8g&oe=65344C0E

The statement comes amid significant tension on college campuses as pressure to condemn the recent terrorist attacks by Hamas, the militant group in control of the Gaza strip, comes into conflict with long-standing student movements criticizing Israeli policies and actions in Palestine. Princeton has not seen student statements comparable to other universities thus far.

instagram,"Hundreds of people in pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups gathered in Monument Circle Thursday night to show support for their respective sides in the Middle East conflict.

On one side of Monument Circle, a pro-Palestinian group called for an end to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.

On the other, a group of pro-Israel counter-protestors gathered to show their support for the country following a violent attack from the terrorist group Hamas last weekend.

Malkah Bird is a member of Jewish Voice for Peace Indiana and helped organize the pro-Palestinian event.

‚ÄúOur goal tonight is just to show there is a place where everybody can live peacefully. It does not have to be one or the other,‚Äù she said.

Bird called for the U.S. to de-escalate the conflict and create a ceasefire.

Protestors said that Gaza is experiencing a humanitarian crisis. Israel has cut off food, water, fuel, and electricity in retaliation for the attack Hamas carried out in Israel's southern towns that left at least 1,300 people dead, NPR reported.

Mohammad Abu Hummos, a Fishers resident with the Palestinian Youth Movement, said he worries for his family members in Palestine.

‚ÄúThey have been in a hallway for an entire week because they don‚Äôt want to risk the chance of mourning each other,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú...I haven‚Äôt had time to process the entire thing so I can be here for my community and give them this outlet to come out today.‚Äù

Across the circle, Marina Teremets, an Israeli resident, is part of a counter-protest. She was visiting Indianapolis when her flight home was canceled because of the conflict.

‚ÄúWe heard this pro-Palestinian thing is happening and no representation on the Israeli side and that‚Äôs the least we can do for our country,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú...We don‚Äôt know how long to rent Airbnbs for, how long to rent cars for ‚Äî we just don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Allon Friedman, who helped organize the pro-Israel rally with the Jewish American Affairs Committee of Indiana, denied it was specifically in response to the pro-Palestinian event across the plaza.

instagram,"We are deeply appalled by the atrocious acts of terrorism of Hamas. We stand in solidarity with the people of Israel and with Jewish people in Germany and around the world. The ongoing calls for violence against them are devoid of any humanity. It is intolerable that the killing, hostage-taking, and maltreatment of people is celebrated in Germany and elsewhere. We forcefully reject this. There must be no room for antisemitism!

Attacks on civilians are never an option. 

It is with great concern that we observe the devastating situation in which the civilian population of Gaza finds itself due to the escalation of violence. We support all efforts to find a sustainable resolution of the conflict in Israel and Palestine and we do hope for a timely humanitarian solution for the civilian population in Gaza.

We will continue to actively fight against antisemitism and advocate for a society that values the lives and integrity of all people.

Diesem stellen wir uns entschieden entgegen. F√ºr Antisemitismus darf es keinen Raum geben!

Angriffe auf Zivilist*innen sind niemals eine Option. 

Mit gro√üer Ersch√ºtterung nehmen wir die desastr√∂se Situation wahr, in der sich die Zivilbev√∂lkerung Gazas in Folge der Eskalation der Gewalt befindet. Wir unterst√ºtzen alle Bem√ºhungen zur nachhaltigen Beilegung des Konflikts in Israel und Pal√§stina und hoffen insbesondere auf eine schnelle humanit√§re L√∂sung f√ºr die Zivilbev√∂lkerung in Gaza.

We hope for world peace, and stand with the innocent people affected by the conflict, regardless of their nationality, religion, ethnicity, or where they were born.

Misaky means ‚Äúa beautiful future‚Äù in Japanese, a future we hope to create through our sweets where equality, fairness, and peace thrive. 
Our brand was inspired by the Japanese traditional tea ceremony, where everyone was treated equally regardless of their social rank.

That is why, we create vegan, gluten-free sweets that can be shared among everyone.
That is why, we hire more women and minorities in the male-dominated food industry.

We would do whatever it takes to make that beautiful future happen, and what we can do right now is to deliver the treatment and security the affected people deserve.

During 10/13 ~ 10/15, we are donating 100% of our proceeds coming from our „ÄêWorld Peace Box„Äëto Doctors Without Borders.
This box represents different cultural flavors from all over the world, thus representing world unity.

Please join us to support innocent lives.

instagram,"McDonald's Peace Theory is not widely recognized, but rather a concept often associated with the term ""McDonald's Peace"" or the ""Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention."" This idea, often attributed to journalist and author Thomas L. Friedman is an informal theory that suggests that countries with McDonald's franchises are less likely to go to war with each other.
The underlying notion is that countries with a middle class large enough to support a McDonald's restaurant and other elements of globalization are less inclined to engage in conflict with one another. The theory is based on the idea that globalization, economic interdependence, and cultural exchange created by companies like McDonald's promote peaceful relations between countries, as war could disrupt the economic ties and cultural exchange that have been fostered. It is important to remember that correlation does not mean causation. Friedman‚Äôs theory, although humorous at first, is a hauntingly accurate indication of the connection that trade holds with peace. The more rational explanation of this phenomenon is that countries with McDonald‚Äôs in them tend to be more economically developed and open to trade. This is because, for a business to invest a large amount of capital, the region must be stable, or else there is a high risk of losing that investment. 
It's important to note that the McDonald's Peace theory is more of an observation than a formal academic theory, and it has been met with both support and criticism. Some argue that economic and cultural factors play a role in reducing the likelihood of conflict between countries, while others point out that the theory oversimplifies the complex dynamics of international relations and conflicts. Regardless, it serves as a popular and accessible way to discuss the potential impact of economic and cultural ties on global peace.

instagram,"Here‚Äôs half of my face for the algorithm. Just popping in to say no matter your faith, no matter your heritage, please light a candle or do whatever you can to hold space for the people of Palestine right now. I fear the worst for them as their neighborhoods, homes, and family members are turned to dust before our very eyes.

I am of Jewish decent, among other things. My father was raised a Jew, my mother a Roman Catholic, and they did not dictate for me a specific faith tradition. But I am alive today in part because my Jewish ancestors were clever, spry, or lucky enough to evade persecution.  I say that for context, but the truth is that being Jewish (or Jew-ish in my case) is not the only qualifier for speaking out against what is happening to Palestinians right now. This is genocide. Full stop. And if you live in the US and you pay your taxes, you are funding it. 

It IS NOT antisemitic to speak out against the siege in Gaza, to call out the Israeli government for ruling Palestinians under apartheid, or to oppose the colonization of Palestine by Israelis. The UN has condemned the actions of the Israeli government as war crimes over and over again.  It is possible to love and care for a group of people and disagree with the tactics of a government charged with representing them. Netanyahu‚Äôs approval ratings were extremely low even among Israeli‚Äôs leading up to the events of the last week. 

A member of my family has already told me they no longer respect me for posting the video I posted yesterday. The video features a Jewish American author who compassionately innumerates the offenses committed by the Israeli government. The author didn‚Äôt spout any hateful rhetoric, they simply spoke out as a Jew against the documented actions of the Israeli government and its military while also condemning Hamas.

It is precisely because I love and respect my family that I have to tell them to consider another point of view.  You can love someone and call them out on hypocrisy.  Never again means never again for everyone.  I‚Äôm sending light to all affected by this conflict. May it offer clarity, warmth, and comfort through this dark time.",,266,"{'like_count': 266, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 33922}",Anna Toth,,2023-10-13 23:51:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/26180610_1273498796128250_2340186254907277312_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=n2FLoDDWBMUAX-qqk-F&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBa3uIqhCMBoGgtbYvhfBG8ZmycfHlmE-MDPlgPFUACSg&oe=655A426D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyW6xChLIbx/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391416819_24212337445017211_2951397464089494891_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ZQhHI6ujn10AX8L5dlL&_nc_oc=AQmHByAO5UZ87qmbgBRQqWIez9uLVJai7WIF82Z5sK18h5ZpOT0jC8WehBkuSfBlK0Y&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBYBBNKFjqGA_mOmN52Ooe7GfT28OQTXJoPQ9wsz6f37g&oe=655ACF1E

instagram,"It‚Äôs taken me a long time to process what‚Äôs been happening in the Middle East over the last few days.

As a Jew I am appalled by the massacres in Israel of a lot of people who were actually working towards peace with Palestinians and were murdered in cold blood. As a humanitarian I am also appalled by what is happening in Gaza and what has been happening to Palestinians for decades. 

With that said I don‚Äôt want to talk about sides I want to talk about all the mis Information I‚Äôm seeing on social media. There are too many of what I call ""Graduates of the University of Google‚Äù. Please do your research. Please don‚Äôt just post some thing, just because you think it will support your argument, without actually researching  facts and educating yourself. Honestly has anyone ever seen someone win an argument on social media? The only real winners are the owners of these platforms whose business thrive on promoting discourse. 

So instead of us wasting our time being armchair experts from the comfort of our homes - we need to go out and do something positive and constructive for the cause we support - and work towards peace for both sides. Because at the end of all this horrific tragedy there has to be peace and hope. We need to get rid of the evil on both sides, that has driven us into this situation. 

I‚Äôd also like to address some misinterpretations that I keep seeing. 
Not all Zionists are Jews and not all Jews are Zionists. 
Not  all Palestinians are Hamas, besides Muslim Palestinians they were also Christians, Druze, and yes even some Jews. 
Not  all Israelis are Jews and they are not all originally from Eastern Europe, many are from North Africa and the Middle East. There are also Arab Israeli‚Äôs who are Muslim & Christians, plus a small population of Armenians, Circassians to name a few.

Let's put our energy into something positive In this terrible terrible terrible time.

instagram,"Condemning hate; Supporting one another (message from Thursday evening, 10/12): ""I write with a heavy heart as I, like many in our community, continue to reflect on Israel and Gaza, the deaths of innocent victims and the unfolding humanitarian crisis.

First, we condemn the unspeakable atrocities perpetrated last weekend, along with all acts of antisemitism and hatred. 

We are also saddened for all families who are impacted in some way by the escalating conflict, including those with familial, cultural and spiritual ties to Israel and Gaza who live among us right here in Chapel Hill and Carrboro. I am thinking in particular of our students, their families and our staff members here at home, who are processing these tragic events. 

We recognize that our Jewish and Muslim students, families and staff may feel the ripple effects of this in different ways. We also recognize there are varied opinions, views and perspectives about how a school district should respond. The purpose of my message is to share with each of you that we‚Äôre watching and listening, and we will steadfastly support the peace, safety and wellbeing for all who call this community home. It‚Äôs why I think our role as a district is to share a message about the importance of wholeheartedly looking out for one another during this time, and where you can consider turning for additional support. 

Please know that our district‚Äôs School Support and Wellness teams are prepared to offer their support to students and staff. If you or someone you know is struggling, please don‚Äôt hesitate to speak with a trusted adult at school. 

Thank you for reading, and I offer my gratitude to all who have shared (either with me, or with our schools) their life experiences and thoughtful perspectives as we address the impact here at home. In closing, our schools must always be places of joy and kindness, where we value the diverse backgrounds that make us a community.

Through the anguish and grief, we will support one another.""

#pathways_to_peace

I maintain hope in the next generation's ability to address the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and achieve the peace that eluded my generation. In 2014, I launched ""Pathways to Peace"" at the University of Illinois @ictrueblue in collaboration with President Jimmy Carter @CarterCenter. This initiative engaged young minds from diverse academic backgrounds in seeking solutions, redefining the conflict, supporting Palestinian rights, proposing a two-state solution, promoting cultural interaction, and revising school curricula to address historical trauma. It not only presented potential solutions but also inspired young leaders to contribute to justice, conflict resolution, and peace. We continue working to bridge differences, propose peaceful solutions, and pursue peace and justice in our region and worldwide. #Palestine #Israel #pathways_to_peace",,250,"{'like_count': 235, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 72619}",KAH Life Journey,,2023-10-13 05:00:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/347222099_274457408291470_4065532630255870077_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=uJTvt-sAcsQAX88GdbW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA0JedzT4keQWNXJwIb2UWGhk3WjqxhpE9pXKQaUFzo8g&oe=655B403D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyU5SR3p_2G/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387739621_669811905215249_8725741638977454032_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=QJgSejs5afUAX9LUkcl&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAMtqGICXZQQOJ6biE1sbc1Z2CUVQeqYE6tqzpXpzcTkA&oe=6546E1D0

instagram,"Through the well-mannered comedy, Salute presents people coming together in the face of uncertain times ahead. 

Set to the irresistible sway of Hans Christian Lumbye‚Äôs waltzes and polkas, links to the nineteenth century continue in how Kobborg uses his Danish heritage as a departure point for Salute, taking elements of Bournonville style and restating them anew for contemporary audiences. A loose story illustrates the relationship between soldiers and the women they leave behind before going off to war; danced vignettes imbued with the blithe innocence of youth feature a comically blustering general and a recruit who isn‚Äôt exactly what they seem.

Times of conflict do not usually give us pause for pleasure, but Johan Kobborg‚Äôs Salute takes something of the gallantry and honor we associate with warfare in bygone times to create a good-humored ballet that is a lighthearted vehicle to display the dancers‚Äô expressive abilities and comic timing.

instagram,"The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken‚Äôs press conference on Thursday concluding his visit to Israel conveyed three things. One, the Biden Administration will be seen as backing Israel to the hilt by way of meeting its security needs but Washington will not be drawn into the forthcoming Gaza operations except to arrange exit routes in the south for hapless civilians fleeing the conflict zone. Two, Washington‚Äôs top priority at the moment is on engaging with the regional states who wield influence with Hamas to negotiate the hostage issue. Fourteen US citizens in Israel remain unaccounted for. (White House confirmed that the death toll in the fighting now includes at least 27 Americans.)

Three, the US will coordinate with the regional states to prevent any escalation in the situation to widen the conflict on the part of Hezbollah. Although the US cannot and will not stop Israeli leadership on its tracks apropos the imminent Gaza operation, it remains unconvinced. Blinken was non-committal about any direct US military involvement, and the chances are slim as things stand. Most important, even as Blinken could hear the war drums, he also cast his eye on a future for Israel (and the region) where it will be at peace with itself, would integrate into the region and concentrate on creating economic prosperity ‚Äî metaphorically put, beating its swords into plowshares in a Biblical Messianic intent.

instagram,"Ben Shapiro faces backlash after posting 'AI image of burnt Israeli baby'

13 October, 2023

Ben Shapiro faces criticism for sharing an AI-generated image falsely portrayed as a ""burnt Jewish baby"" following Hamas' attack on Israel, highlighting the spread of misinformation during the Israel-Gaza conflict.

Conservative American columnist Ben Shapiro has faced backlash over the image he shared [Getty]

Right-wing American¬†columnist Ben Shapiro has faced backlash over an image he shared purporting to show a ""burnt Jewish baby"" after Saturday's attack by Hamas fighters on Israel.
Shapiro‚Äôs post on social media platform X triggered a note warning that the image was generated by artificial intelligence (AI).
The image was confirmed to be AI-generated via the image authenticity detection site aiornot.com, as highlighted by many social media users.
Social media personality Jackson Hinkle was quick to point out Shapiro's alleged deception,¬†posting on X:¬†""The image that Ben Shapiro tried to pass off as a 'burnt baby corpse' was an AI-generated fake image!""

Another X user also accused Shapiro of using a fake image to defend Israel's relentless bombardment and total siege of Gaza, which has so far killed over 1,750 Palestinians, including over 500 children.
Shapiro denied the accusations and claimed that AI content detectors were not always accurate.

instagram,"For too long, society has swung between extremes of matriarchal and patriarchal domination. Yet true progress arises in equality, not inverted power structures. Beyond conflict lies a higher synthesis. What we need is not matriarchy versus patriarchy, but a fusion of the two - a collaborative integration of the feminine and the masculine. In balance there is wisdom. In partnership there is strength.

instagram,"""The trigger in our minds for all the dominoes to fall is for Israel to cross into Gaza,"" Dale Buckner, retired US Army colonel and CEO of the global security firm Global Guardian, told Insider.

""If Israel makes the decision that it's going to attack Gaza in some shape or form ‚Äî whether that's from sea, air, or ground ‚Äî then this escalates materially because now you have all the different cells that Iran backs throughout the region,"" he said.

Over the weekend, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. Israel said 1,300 people were killed and more than 100 people were taken hostage.

On Sunday, Israel declared a state of war and a day later announced a ""complete siege"" of Gaza. Israel's retaliations have left more than 1,500 people dead as of Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.

Late on Thursday, Israel said that civilians living in northern Gaza needed to evacuate the area within 24 hours, suggesting that a large-scale attack could be imminent.

Buckner pointed to signs of escalations across Israel's borders that could tilt a possible Israeli-Hamas war into a regional conflict.

In the north, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets and shells against Israeli positions on Sunday in a contested region along the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

While in the south, Israeli forces have bombed the crossings of food, medicine, and fuel deliveries from Egypt into Gaza.

Having served as a US Army veteran for 24 years, Buckner said he knows ""these escalations have a way of taking life on their own, and that's the risk here.""

Israel's incursion into Gaza could create a ""domino effect"" that triggers all its neighbors in the region to join the conflict, Buckner said.

Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute, made a similar point to The Washington Post.

""This could easily get out of control,"" he told the newspaper, adding: ""Everything is in place for a cascading series of events that will culminate in Israel attacking Iran.""",,234,"{'like_count': 226, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-13 15:09:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyV-7CNgKR8/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391159371_282312741349972_5282992663503146895_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0oFn9vremqwAX8-2zwU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAQhzhp1BBvtcMdUwK-Rm_dAs3URw1fRLxxTcYAEmnSNQ&oe=65318E70

These forces believe in the complete destruction of the other. The path of peaceful engagement and resolution is an anathema to them. Hamas and Netanyahu have the same denominational spirit, albeit, anchored on the exact opposite sides of the same coin.

When the leader of the armed resistance group, Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) i.e., Yasser Arafat, heeded to the reformatory call of peaceful engagement and signed the ‚ÄòOslo Peace Accord‚Äô he had said, ‚ÄúWe will need more courage and determination to continue the course of building coexistence and peace between us.

instagram,"This war is a human tragedy. Genocide is NOT the  response to a nation saying it must protect itself. The murder of all innocent people is wrong, but this conflict didn't begin a few days ago. 

Our government & news media did not do any condemning when Palestinians were being oppressed, persecuted,  tortured, murdered, wrongfully imprisoned, discriminated against, forced out of their homes to live inhumane lives, killing children... the list goes on and on. Isreal has committed major war crimes against them for almost 80 years!  The acknowledgment of the whole truth must happen for a just resolution to be possible. Genocide is not a solution, and all Palestinians are being dehumanized again.

instagram,"For anyone curious about what the orthodox rabbi making the rounds believes in: 

‚ÄúWhich brings us to one of the more bizarre intellectual outgrowths on the gnarled tree of the Middle East conflict: Neturei Karta.

Chances are you have seen these guys. At any major pro-Palestinian rally, BDS protest or Khomeinist Quds Day march you can‚Äôt miss them: that group of ultra-orthodox Jews, replete with black hats and side curls, always at the frontline and always among those shouting the loudest.

This in itself isn‚Äôt newsworthy. Plenty of Jews throughout Israel and the diaspora actively campaign for Palestinian rights. What marks Neturei Karta out, and earns them so much controversy, is their savagely extremist tone, and the lengths they are willing to go to spread the anti-Zionist message.

Most Western pro-Palestinians operate somewhere between vague support of a two-state solution and actively boycotting Sabra Hummus, but they would (or perhaps should) balk at marching alongside openly racist, genocidal organizations like Hamas or Hezbollah. Neturei Karta, on the other hand, traveled to Gaza in person to hang out with Ismail Haniyeh and offer Hamas material and moral support. When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hosted his ‚ÄúReview of the Holocaust‚Äù conference in Tehran, featuring keynotes from Ku Klux Klan grandee David Duke and Holocaust deniers Robert Faurisson and Michele Renouf, Neturei Karta were there front and centre. Nor do they confine themselves to fascists in the Middle East. Neturei Karta rabbis have spoken alongside the out-and-out anti-semites of Hungary‚Äôs Jobbik party as well as British far-right groups.

Meanwhile, they even managed to put in a star turn at the launch of former MP George Galloway's bid to become mayor of London.

This seemingly perverse incongruity has earned the sect bewilderment from liberal activists and observers, and loathing, revulsion and anathema from broad swathes of mainstream Jewry.

So, what makes a group of ultra-orthodox Jews utterly dedicate their lives to bringing down the world‚Äôs one Jewish state? What drives them to ally with Hamas, which in the past has described their people as, ‚Äúthe most despicable people on the face of the",,230,"{'like_count': 222, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 29326}",Matilda Bickers,,2023-10-13 03:26:10,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/397894571_1822250871526262_7040233657427979637_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=wXHzjS5Svx8AX9L-mNN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAmrx6E_buz3_EwlxJBBPGGKuJ66AnCSdCo2GNiMNwe-w&oe=655B8840,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyUue66LQeD/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391355738_1358258158402113_1385327339555838199_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=lQ_zpUCtyxIAX-zJSdK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCnObxnCctn3GIoSBZTbWZPhpTsXxpMMXilSbK66O8mIA&oe=65375C93

That risk is real, as Israel‚Äôs army prepares to invade Gaza in response to an attack by the militant group. The death toll from the Hamas assault and the ongoing Israeli air strikes on Gaza is already in the thousands. There‚Äôs concern that militias in Lebanon and Syria that support Hamas will join the fighting.‚Å£

A sharper escalation could bring Israel into direct conflict with Iran, a supplier of arms and money to Hamas, which the US and the European Union have designated a terrorist group.

Dear Friends- Thank you for your patience as I have taken the time to collect my thoughts on the recent events that have taken place in Israel and Palestine. My heart is filled with profound sadness for all of the innocent people affected by these atrocities caused by  these butchers of hate we know as Hamas. 

I have been compelled to reread Eli Wiesel‚Äôs acceptance speech of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. In that he said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶And that is why I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must ‚Äì at that moment ‚Äì become the center of the universe‚Äù. I refuse to be silent any longer so I will let my thoughts be known here. 

Let me be clear here. I stand with the innocent people of Israel. I stand against Hamas. I stand with the innocent people of Palestine, who do not support Hamas nor condone hate towards Jewish people. I stand against hate. I stand for Peace. I stand against ignorance. I stand for Love. I stand against the senseless murders carried out by Hamas. I stand for the safety of all the innocent children on both sides of the conflict. 

I recently read an Opinion column in the NYT‚Äôs written by Nir Avishai Cohen, a major in the reserves of the Israel Defense Forces. This particular quote struck a chord with me: ‚ÄúIt is important to me to make it clear that in this already unstoppable new war, we cannot allow the massacre of innocent Israelis to result in the massacre of innocent Palestinians. Israel must remember that there are more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip. The vast majority of them are innocent. Israel must do everything in its power to avoid killing innocent people, and focus on destroying the militant army of Hamas‚Äù. {continues on next post}",,227,"{'like_count': 203, 'comment_count': 24, 'num_users': 17415}",John Gomes,,2023-10-13 16:18:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/90091725_642942526528576_7710460125982490624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=k1cqYRoqyucAX_Q3NGN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDoBlbVk71_T8dlqhU4_P6MAgzj3D8elgJvGX_YTuz-Fg&oe=655ABFB5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWG0ZxuJH-/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391504541_1010865446909325_3529535379486056258_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=LEmEaPqg6n4AX_eznro&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDJw0mXoegM1FcWhpe63wDiUEkOTBrDltUOStx0GTJX3Q&oe=65596553
instagram,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Slips 3% as Cryptocurrency Market Reacts to CPI Data as JPMorgan Awaits SEC's ETF Verdict

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data has recently stirred reactions in the crypto space, causing BTC to slip by 3%. As this unfolds, JPMorgan awaits the SEC's verdict on the ETF, poised to be a major determinant of Bitcoin's short-term price trajectory.
 
Adding another layer to the regulatory landscape, the looming deadline for the SEC to address its August 29 setback against Grayscale approaches, with the Commission having only until midnight on Friday to respond. 

The escalating conflict in the Middle East raises concerns for the digital currency industry. Recognizing the situation's urgency, Coinbase's CEO appeals to Congress, emphasizing the need for prompt and rational cryptocurrency legislation in these tumultuous times.

Grayscale vs SEC: Friday Midnight Deadline Looms for August 29 Challenge

Grayscale Investments achieved a significant legal victory when the D.C. Circuit Court ruled in their favour on August 29, allowing them to convert their Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an Exchange-traded fund (ETF). 

The court found that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had arbitrarily and capriciously denied the proposal. 

The SEC was given a 45-day window to appeal, with the deadline set for October 13 at midnight. If the SEC chooses not to appeal, it is equivalent to approval, potentially paving the way for the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the US.

However, the market speculates that alternative arguments could be used to reject the ETF, possibly related to Coinbase's involvement. The outcome could affect the cryptocurrency market, with potential sell pressure.

Amidst Middle East Tensions, Coinbase CEO Pushes for Swift Crypto Legislation

Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has urged the US Congress to promptly enact sensible cryptocurrency legislation as the Middle East conflict escalates.",,224,"{'like_count': 215, 'comment_count': 9, 'num_users': 949711}",‚†ÄùòΩùôûùô©ùôòùô§ùôûùô£ üåê,,2023-10-13 12:47:06,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/21879758_277528332750016_5428998976093290496_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=SUItTiW77h8AX977wGE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDy-3DuHQDwrsZ2O3G5V6Qfp75JqQLuuK9Mx05bu3q7Nw&oe=655A1B56,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyVurZwxfFY/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387798785_3572249899730319_2979528917470035683_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9VLk3IoGHxoAX-5ZXbg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA7kuSNxGGy9U7VC0vak2oXNswjRQMqPJcwgkfshgUzUQ&oe=65365CA8

For those saying ‚Äúcarry this that and the other today‚Äù the reality is today is no different than any other day

A constant state of hyper-vigilance, understanding what your area can yield as far as protest, violence, resources, etc‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs lineage and history is all gonna determine how you approach events such as this

Israel is a robust country with some amazing intelligence capabilities and tactical resources, if a plot of this magnitude can slip by a country that lives in a constant state of survival then ask yourself where you truly fall on that matrix of readiness

Be honest with yourself, if your ill-equipped, under-trained and lacking skills the industry is ready to embrace you and get you up to snuff

instagram,"The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) says it‚Äôs been notified that two South Africans have been killed in the conflict currently gripping the Middle East.

In the early hours of Saturday morning, the militant wing of Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel from Gaza.

The conflict has since descended into a full-blown war, with Israel unleashing a barrage of rockets on Gaza in response.

Thousands have been killed so far.

Dirco spokesperson, Clayson Monyela: ""The Department of International Relations and Cooperation can confirm that we have been notified that two South African nationals have died in this ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel. The verification process is currently underway because one of the individuals is reported to have an Israeli ID number, so we need to determine whether there is dual citizenship or what the picture is.""

instagram,"First I wanna just start off by saying I want peace between all Jews and Arabs, Palestinians alike. If I was in Netanyahu the terrorists shoes, I'd ensure clean water for all the Palestinians and make sure they get the infrastructure for that.

With that said, why did Arafat say this? He said this because the Palestinian people have never been a nation. They've never had a king. They've never had their own language, or religion, or borders for a state. NEVER.

So when you say that they should have the whole land of Israel, you've completely lost the plot.

These people are Arabian/Syrian. The ""Palestinian"" identity is a relatively new one for them, it's their right to identify as Palestinian, but it doesn't mean these are the same people who have been in that region for thousands of years, because they haven't. 

All Palestine ever was, was a district in that land, which was mainly called Syria.

PS: If I'm wrong, correct me. I'm always willing to learn and clearly not always right. Does anyone have any type of flag, or emblem that Palestinians have had for thousands of years? Does anyone know the name of any King that these people have had? As far as I know there's nothing and they literally copied the Jordanian flag.",,213,"{'like_count': 150, 'comment_count': 63, 'num_users': 14617}",Charles Kassin,,2023-10-13 00:49:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/319530368_235524762133741_6833792636120429918_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ezsh1tLcwQEAX9N9-nK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAWOXhw1X2VviZbYHzkYkd9bPVo3LIBT_WBiRx8AR46yw&oe=655B3EC8,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyUciH8OWoY/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386899701_608476751263888_1023194557800141440_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=hgsancmu-pEAX92yka_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB3opxEuh0OADE6DFvleL9vKG1h-j1cA1n6VHGi5xQPQA&oe=655A42C0

instagram,"Reflecting on the words of Judith Butler, we are reminded of how power and precariousness are always inextricably linked. 

We are reminded of our interdependence as human beings, despite our profound differences.

We hold close in our hearts the growing number of innocent victims in both Israel and Palestine. We mourn these casualties of a conflict rooted in incalculable generational trauma and suffering and the present trauma of terror across the region.

All people deserve freedom, dignity, safety, and protection from the violence of occupation and war. 

May we all have the strength and courage to move beyond the impulse of fear and isolation.

May we find ways to ground deeper into our bodies, to connect to each of our own precarious lives in ways that allow for greater compassion and connection to ourselves and others.

May we join together in pursuit of peace and stability, an end to the attacks against Palestine and an end to the justification of any and all terror falsely committed in the name of liberation.

May peace prevail.

The Israeli military claimed it was unaware of the use of white phosphorus weapons in Gaza but didn't address the allegations regarding Lebanon. 

The conflict began with Hamas attacks, and more than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. 

Human Rights Watch presented video evidence showing artillery-fired white phosphorus used near the Israel-Lebanon border and in Gaza, allegedly for smokescreens or signaling.

Suddenly, social media specialists, graphic designers, audience engagement editors, headline writers and visual journalists find themselves handling a large volume of stories related to the war and local reactions.

While there are many sources of information, it‚Äôs important to recognize that both Hamas and the Israeli government have an interest in presenting their side of warfare. For journalists, the ethical principle of independence requires news organizations to be open to completeness and accuracy.

1. Social media - uplift and amplify Palestinian voices, limit any ‚Äúhot takes‚Äù you may have.

3. Educating selves - understand what a free Palestine means, how we get there, and how it's a part of the world revolutionary struggle.

4. Do not pass on zionist lies - don‚Äôt repeat Israeli propaganda or framing. Words like ‚Äúconflict‚Äù or ‚Äúreligion‚Äù minimize the heart of the issue, which is colonization and apartheid. 

5. If you have the means, donate.

There is a Hunters Only Zone that is the southern and eastern portion of the property encompassing the Edison West (371) and Edison East (372) hunting access sites, and a wildlife viewing zone outside the Hunters Only Zone. The Hunters Only Zone includes a safety buffer of approximately 250 yards.

All users in the Hunters Only Zone must park in the designated parking spot and follow all posted rules for their designated area including being fully licensed as a Washington hunter.

The new access rules are posted at the field entrances and there is increased signage at the boundary of the Hunters Only Zone. Violations of these site rules may be subject to prosecution under the Revised Code of Washington.

This is a seasonal access rule, applying from the beginning of the general waterfowl hunting season and running through the first Saturday in February. Spatially separating user groups on this small Wildlife Area Unit will increase safety and improve experiences for all users while reducing the potential for negative interactions or conflict.

instagram,"And don‚Äôt forget‚Ä¶ GO TRAIN. The world is in a strange place, but it‚Äôs been here before. The best thing anyone can do who‚Äôs not actively involved in conflict is start preparing like it‚Äôs coming. With conflict and natural disasters the most important thing you can have is a safe and secure place to hunker down. Have water and provisions available, and a way to get information from the outside world. Power outages in hospitals, refuge in bomb shelters, limited supplies‚Ä¶ etc. So if you are continuing to monitor social media this is the time to take notes. Items you need especially medical, tactics of invading forces/infiltrators, issues with mass evacuations‚Ä¶ everything in real time. Train like your life depends on it‚Ä¶ because it does.

instagram,"We have the whispers of the divine serpent calling us to do the work of transformation. 

Pitr Paksha, the ancestral ritual portal ended on the cusp of a powerful and quite volatile solar eclipse. The eclipse was the threshold of Navaratri, the 9 nights & days of Devotion to the Divine Mother.

Yoga is a journey of interiorizing awareness for transformation and divine discovery. And this is what eclipses and NavarƒÅtri invite us to do. So take the cosmic invitation. 

At this time old patterns whip into the present - including ancestral themes and past lifetimes. Conflict, illusion, retaliation are some of the themes. But it is also a time of transformation and disentanglement. This time can also press us forward. The question is, in what way are we stepping forward?

This is a time - individually & collectively - to use spiritual wisdom, practice and remedy to work with our deep rooted unconscious patterns, called sa·πÉskƒÅra. 

To make right wise action, we have to make internal change. At the glob level this means system change and change amongst those in power. At the individual level this means inner transformation... letting go of old patterns and establishing new ones. 

For individuals, we call on yoga nidra and mantra to work at the samskara level and change the inner patterns. 

May we as a human family be divinely guided to respond deliberately & dharmically moment to moment. 

If you are a seeker on the path of yoga heed the call. 

Love, 
Kaya

It's about gaddamn time!! I asked for the impossible and he and his team delivered. It's not hyperbole when I say his work on this film is iconic ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•

How does one design a soundscape and score that encompasses the complexities and nuances of immigrant life in colonial society, the weight of generational trauma, and the struggle to belong in a hostile society all while sounding uniquely Filipino. Jon has created a sound and score more than the sum of its parts. When the budget could not afford the imagery, Jon‚Äôs sound and score painted the picture. Big sound and loud crashes are to be expected in horror films but Jon‚Äôs  use of silence was just as effective. To achieve the authenticity I wanted, he used uniquely Filipino sounds and instruments like the tropical clacks of Tinikling bamboos and the brass gongs of the Kulingtan. I had never heard of that instrument before but there was a specificity to his choice that elevated everything. He chose the Kulingtan to reflect Joy and Grace‚Äôs place in society. The sound it produces does not fit within any western music scale but Jon found a way to have them exist in unison with western instruments but also utilised their discordance to heighten conflict and horror. The result is truly incredible. It‚Äôs not hyperbole when I say what he‚Äôs done is iconic and like the film itself, his score simply hasn't been done before and he delivered spectacularly.",,169,"{'like_count': 159, 'comment_count': 10, 'num_users': 50284}",Paris Zarcilla,,2023-10-13 10:16:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/72627652_2438010956317141_6948156052881801216_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KWodolilwwgAX8sXZRW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAd2THYUD1sLOadrHCubnjfMIjMjWSwpWhBOKMd5cahIw&oe=655A595E,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyVdfc5qi5S/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391019060_1065169591585097_228882045225460407_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=Fkv8inxjM94AX-G0288&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAVvizZ6Ky29M2fAjnFrQk3NMY90QR-cgS7Xs1eW8-PUA&oe=655989AA

instagram,"This Sunday begins Navaratri - the nine night celebration of the Goddess Durga who awakens courage, the warrior of love and the sacred activist in all of us. She is one of the deities that I have the most potent connection with - and this time is always one of deep transformation and power for me. I am offering a practice over these days of chanting, meditation - with an opening and closing ceremony. I will share with you the mythology and we will have a group to connect to each other over the time. You will be invited to fast, let go of habits and create sacred space during this time. We will be offering up our energies and prayers to all who need it at this time - especially the souls passing in the Palestine/Isreal conflict and all those effected. Prayer isn‚Äôt enough but it is something. The mantras and the transmission open up this deep courage as we enter into the heart of transformation. If you want to join and connect with Durga, the info is in the link in my profile. You are welcome to join in this sacred practice.

All of Israel ""is one big war zone at the moment,"" @avimayer said. For journalists, it's ""our duty to get these stories out to the world."" We talked about the physical dangers and psychological toll of the war. And I asked about how our paths diverged, since, twenty years ago, we were both college freshmen in Maryland. In Jerusalem, he said, ""there's a purpose to my presence here.""

In Gaza, ""it's really tragic and intense,"" @mohamhawish said, and ""knowing that I can be a target at any moment is just very horrific."" When I heard a child's voice in the background, I asked how his two year old is coping with the explosions in the distance. Mohammed said the worst part is not knowing how or when the conflict will end. ""Entire families are being wiped out here,"" he said.

instagram,"Message from Chancellor Carol Christ to the Berkeley campus community: 

We are increasingly concerned by the growing prevalence of online threats, doxxing and harassment connected to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. We decry any calls for violence in any form or support for terrorism as we continue to mourn the loss of innocent life. We understand this rhetoric is creating deep fear and concern among many members of our campus community. With that in mind, we want to share an extraordinary message, written by two of our faculty, one who is Palestinian and one who is Israeli:

To our students,

We are two professors on this campus who disagree, vehemently. But we have always treated one another with respect and dignity. We love this campus with its diverse communities and all of our students and are heartbroken to hear of incidents of near violence between students in recent days. We will not tolerate our students harming one another. Disagreement and differing points of view are an essential part of campus life, and we expect that you treat one another with the same respect and dignity that we are modeling here.

- Dr. Hatem Bazian (Lecturer of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures and Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies)
- Dr. Ron Hassner (Professor of Israel Studies)

We want to assure you that the campus is taking steps necessary to support public safety for all at events and protests related to the conflict and across the campus the general.

instagram,"Something about the noise in the pencil marks does communicate a lot about what's going on in my head these days. 

Tensions are escalating, conflict is rising, the world is ending. And I don't know if this is going to get better or worse. If there is going to be relief from all this anger. I am praying for justice for the Palestinians, as we witness present day colonialism in the region. 

I am hoping for guidance and understanding amongst all this misinformation. It's easy to read a few Instagram posts and develop an opinion about the issue, but are you open to a different perspective? Have you really dug into the history of this conflict outside your social media time?  Emotions are high, and we know that's when we do our least rational thinking. 

I'd listen to all my friends, regardless of which side of the fight they're on, and really understand why they're hurting. It is not their fault that their families and loved ones are at the expense of this genocide. They want justice, they want to hold someone responsible. Many people don't want a part of this, and are just desperate to live normal lives with the absence of conflict. And then cue the propaganda, which further polarises our views, and we forget the one basic thing that we share - we are all human.

instagram,"‚ÄúMy brothers, today we honor the memory of our last Grandmaster, Jacques Bernard De Molay, who died defending the Order from a tyrant, whose greed and lust for wealth and power caused a great conflict between the Church, the Kingdom of France and the Order of the Knights Templar. King Philip IV ordered all the Knights Templar in the kingdom to be arrested, falsely accusing them of heresy. Accusing them of spitting on the Cross, deny the Divinity of Christ, worshipping a silver idol, sorcery and witchcraft. Our brothers have done no such thing and have committed no crimes against God and His Church. Thanks to King Philip's treachery, he had all the Knights in the kingdom, including our Grandmaster De Molay arrested, imprisoned, tortured into making false confessions and later executed by burning them at the stake on false charges of heresy. Jacques De Molay and our Brother Templars died as Martyrs, defending the Order until the end. Today, let us honor the memory of our last Grandmaster and our Brother Templars who died defending the Faith, and never denying their faith in Jesus Christ and to all our Brother Templars who died in the Holy Land, protecting the innocent and safeguarding the Holy Relics of our Lord Jesus Christ. We will rise again. The Order will rise again, and we will defend our Holy Church and our Faith in Jesus Christ, even at the risk of Martyrdom.‚Äù 

Strength and Honour, my Brother Templars.

Never forget the Martyrs of our Holy Order.

instagram,"On October 7th, Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist organization currently in control of Gaza, launched its largest offensive against Israel in 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,' intensifying the enduring conflict between Israel and Palestine.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict began a century ago when Jewish immigrants arrived in the British Mandate of Palestine, leading to tensions between local Arabs and Jewish settlers, each claiming Palestine as their homeland. The 1947 UN Partition Plan was accepted by Israel but rejected by Arab representatives, sparking the first Israeli-Palestinian war. The Six-Day War in 1967 resulted in Israel's occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The 1973 Yom Kippur War was a significant turning point.

The Oslo Accords of 1993-1995 made progress toward a two-state solution, but support has waned. Palestinians oppose Israeli settlement policies and Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) actions, while Israel remains distrustful due to historical hostilities and terror attacks. Recent radical settlement policies and forced displacements under Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership exacerbated tensions. Hamas used these tensions to justify its recent attacks.

The Israeli government, which is led by sixth-time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, turned increasingly radical in its settlement policy and therefore alienated the Palestinian population even further, which often entails the forced displacement of Palestinian residents from their homes, frequently with the assistance of the IDF and the government. Conversely, Israel's apprehension toward Palestine is rooted in a history marked by unanticipated hostilities, armed conflicts, and acts of terrorism perpetrated by Palestinians in Israel.

This incident was used by Hamas to justify their attack on Israel last week. Israel, which declared a state of war, was bombarded by thousands of rockets and attacks from land, air and sea, which left over a thousand Israelis and other nationalities dead and hundreds of hostages taken by Hamas.

The human suffering is unimaginable, and our world changed overnight. 

Working in news, you become a nonstop student of what‚Äôs happening in the world. I‚Äôve always felt humbled and grateful to live a life of studies and insight to local national and world affairs.

It is with a heavy heart that I go about my day in Los Angeles, that I post on social media about normalcy here which is one largely of peace, safety, and security compared to this war torn region with the most gut wrenching of stories, and an unthinkable human tragedy. 

With this in mind, I am humbled, and in awe and grateful I get to do stories of people working to uplift humanity here in Southern California. Thank you, Fox 11 News for 30 years of that!üôè

My promise is to continue to be a student. To value this planet we live on. To commit to projects that work to uplift my fellow human. To love my friends and family, and those I meet along the way.üá∫üá∏

The surprise and brutal attack by Hamas on the Jewish people has been called the 9/11 of Israel. With Israeli hostages being taken to the Gaza strip the bombings there, and plans for a ground war will include much suffering of Palestinians.

World peace may seem so elusive, especially at this hour. But we must keep trying. I witnessed this with my parents. My mother was in the Peace Corps in Brazil. My stepfather/adoptive father was in the Peace Corps in Tanzania Africa.

instagram,"Tabatabai had the opportunity to shape the intelligence to meet her needs.



Last month I wrote about the revelations¬†involving Ariane Tabatabai,¬†currently the Chief of Staff to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, who has a security clearance, but who emails show had collaborated with the Iranian regime.

In 2014, a year before Tabatabai began working as a NATO consultant, she joined an initiative by the Iranian Foreign Ministry to mobilize ‚ÄúIranians who have established affiliations with the leading international think-tanks and academic institutions, mainly in Europe and the US.‚Äù

Tabatabai, along with Dina Esfandiary, her co-author on the proposal to have the United States ally with Iran, who is currently a senior Middle East advisor to George Soros‚Äô Crisis Group, allegedly became members of the ‚Äúcore group‚Äù of Iran‚Äôs influence operation.

Before Tabatabai testified about the Iran Deal in Congress, she allegedly checked in with the head of an Iranian Foreign Ministry think tank. ‚ÄúI am scheduled to go to the Congress to give a talk about the nuclear program. I will bother you in the coming days,‚Äù she wrote.

Jennifer Van Laar at Red State reports¬†that sources have said that Tabatabai was sabotaging counterterrorism materials.

Counterterrorism analysts speaking to RedState on condition of anonymity, whose reports would have crossed Tabatabai‚Äôs desk, say that for at least the past year their product has been watered down, misquoted, or outright quashed. Tabatabai had the opportunity to shape the intelligence to meet her needs, the analysts say, and they say it‚Äôs likely that the overt intel collected during that period went to Iran.

Deeply troubling. Especially as the Biden administration has continued to stand by Tabatabai.",,142,"{'like_count': 134, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 7670}",glbl_jhd_dly_mntr,,2023-10-13 22:09:55,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/13129393_1007939159293798_949321728_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NYXzYkJMI4YAX9oxTN8&_nc_oc=AQn8i4PaJvQCN0TL8sCI1Y0uUtKcbxdjJ3tLzph32VdqyrdlC3C7kpp12n6Dn2-4afo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB5dZugPZ_ERWZl1dr1NnL59qS0ML_xLs9w00gGrcjEiQ&oe=655B4E29,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyWvFe6yNsf/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391268691_671900798245431_4010059041094122583_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nHSI9ZynL5MAX_b3gjZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCWbdYRj6y8YcWOJnwLoBR7CjJWR-DzwV3-jzBEF3akXQ&oe=6534A224

Armata israelianƒÉ ar fi utilizat fosfor alb √Æn opera≈£iunile militare din Gaza ≈üi Liban, acuzƒÉ organiza»õia Human Rights Watch (HRW). Utilizarea acestuia asupra oamenilor este interzisƒÉ din 1997 prin Conven≈£ia de la Geneva.

HRW spune cƒÉ a verificat √ÆnregistrƒÉri realizate mar≈£i ≈üi miercuri √Æn care se vƒÉd ‚Äûmultiple explozii √Æn aer de fosfor alb lansat de artilerie asupra portului din ora≈üul Gaza ≈üi a douƒÉ loca≈£ii rurale de la frontiera dintre Israel ≈üi Liban‚Äù.

‚ÄûFolosirea fosforului alb √Æn zone civile aglomerate creeazƒÉ un risc ridicat de arsuri insuportabile ≈üi suferin≈£e pentru √Æntreaga via≈£ƒÉ‚Äù, a declarat directoarea HRW pentru Orientul Mijlociu ≈üi Africa de nord, Lama Fakih.

Fosforul alb se aprinde c√¢nd este expus la oxigenul din atmosferƒÉ ≈üi poate genera luminƒÉ, fum ≈üi cƒÉldurƒÉ intensƒÉ de circa 815 grade Celsius.

‚ÄûPentru a evita rƒÉnirea civililor, Israelul trebuie sƒÉ punƒÉ capƒÉt utilizƒÉrii fosforului alb √Æn zone populate. PƒÉr≈£ile dintr-un conflict trebuie sƒÉ facƒÉ tot posibilul pentru a limita suferin≈£a civililor‚Äù, a completat responsabila HRW.

instagram,"On Oct. 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, utilizing sea, ground and air tactics. The attack led to around 900 Israeli casualties, 2,500 wounded and over 100 kidnapped. Palestinian casualties exceeded 1,000 in Gaza, with at least 11 American citizens killed, according to the U.S. State Department.

Jewish student organizations at UO expressed support for those affected, organizing vigils and prayers. Oregon politicians, including Senator Jeff Merkley and Congresswoman Val Hoyle, condemned Hamas's attacks and affirmed Israel's right to self-defense.

‚ÄúCitizens of Israel, we are at war,‚Äù Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. ‚ÄúI convened the heads of the security establishment and ordered ‚Äì first of all ‚Äì to clear out the communities that have been infiltrated by terrorists.‚Äù

The conflict between Palestine, backed by Hamas, and Israel has deep historical roots, with the Oct. 7 attack marking another chapter in this ongoing strife. World leaders, such as President Joe Biden, condemned the attacks and advocated for Israel's right to defend itself, while international calls for diplomacy are increasing. 

This is a developing story.

instagram,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to ‚Äúcrush and destroy‚Äù the militant group Hamas in response to its surprise weekend attack that has shaken the Middle East and the world.‚Å†
‚Å†
Netanyahu said every Hamas member is a ‚Äúdead man,‚Äù as Israeli troops mass near the Gaza border while airstrikes rain down on the region. Roughly 2,800 peopled have died on both sides of the conflict so far.‚Å†
‚Å†
But what is Hamas? Here is everything you need to know.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Resistance Movement. It was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian Intifada, or uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.‚Å†
‚Å†
It was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian cleric.‚Å†
‚Å†
According to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence‚Äôs counter-terrorism guide, Hamas has roots in ‚Äúthe Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood,‚Äù which was established in Egypt in the 1920s.‚Å†
‚Å†
It is one of a broad group of actors in the region including Iran, Syria and the Shi‚Äôite Islamist group Hezbollah in Lebanon, which broadly oppose U.S. policy in the Middle East and Israel.‚Å†
‚Å†
In 1988, Hamas published its charter, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society for Palestinians, the Council on Foreign Relations states on its website.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hamas presented a new document in 2017 that suggested it would accept an interim Palestinian state along the ‚ÄúGreen Line‚Äù border established before the 1967 Six-Day War, but refused to recognize Israel.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hamas has a militant wing, which has sent gunmen and suicide bombers into Israel. Hamas calls its armed activities resistance against Israeli occupation.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hamas won 2006 legislative elections and in 2007, violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, the Associated Press reported. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The Palestinian Authority, dominated by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.‚Å†

Are we creators or simply interpreters of an architecture already written in the folds of the universe? The space cities that emerge here seem an answer, but also a new enigma to be deciphered.
