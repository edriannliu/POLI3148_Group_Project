The deceased individuals were identified as a 33-year-old female from Pangasinan and a 42-year-old male from Pampanga.

facebook,"A society that loses its moral compass and believes there is nuance and complexity to people beheading babies is not a society destined to survive. That kind of society cannot withstand any sort of pressure at all; it collapses inward at the first sign of conflict. CNN and MSNBC interviews showed people asserting a moral equivalence between Israelis and the Hamas terrorists who slaughtered families in their homes and decapitated babies. Oh, the sophistication, the nuance. Don‚Äôt you see the shades of gray? The media are disgusting. They‚Äôre truly disgusting. Some of them seek the truth. Some occasionally stumble upon it even if they‚Äôre not seeking it. But then you have the motivated actors who are more interested in their own pseudo-sophistication and moral equivalence than anything else. Terrorism is, by definition, an act of atrocity that involves civilians. If you hide behind a civilian, you are the person responsible for the death of that civilian. And that‚Äôs what Hamas does. Hamas literally located its military headquarters at the bottom of a hospital. This is what they are. They locate their headquarters in mosques. They hide weapons caches in churches and mosques so that if Israel has to blow those things up, then they can claim it‚Äôs some sort of human rights violation. This is what they do. They understand how the Western press plays this garbage. They understand the Western press pretends there is some moral equivalence between a Hamas terrorist riding into a kibbutz and beheading a child and Israel attempting to minimize civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip and failing because Hamas is hiding behind children. Hamas is to blame for both sides of those civilian casualties. Hamas is actively encouraging people not to move from these areas. I know this for a fact: Israel has called off uncounted strikes over the last 30 years because there are civilians in the area.",,11027,"{'like_count': 7054, 'comment_count': 1427, 'num_users': 9291936}",Ben Shapiro,,2023-10-12 01:15:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/370233405_1027799822034655_6133739879477878292_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=DSOFHB8x7AsAX_e0xRr&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCsgW_kg-RgFYtA67SmoPAGB8XIr3eqdvjot09ONGSWgA&oe=655A22BC,https://www.facebook.com/100044139414360/posts/1051366999677937,

For there is nothing more contagious than the pain of innocent men, women, old people and children. The horror of innocent humans brutally torn from their loved ones, beaten, imprisoned, tortured and diabolically terrorized is something that tears at the heart of anyone with a heart capable of beating for their fellow man. As parents, how can we not put ourselves in the shoes of those parents whose children's fate is unknown to them! As human beings, how can we not feel the dramatic echo of so much suffering! As human beings, where can we find hope, optimism, joy of life, when so much of our unfortunate humanity can go? Yet each of us knows in his conscience that every conflict, from the most trivial to the most bitter, is always and only an intellectual accident. We all know the weapons with which we could avoid their tragic consequences. What prevents us from using them? As people of faith, we pray with all our hearts that this will end as soon as possible; that everyone will be able to reunite with their loved ones and return to their homes. Let us pray. Let us pray with contrite hearts, with consistency and intensity, hoping in our hearts that this will end soon.",,4409,"{'like_count': 1824, 'comment_count': 62, 'num_users': 6485971}",Andrea Bocelli,,2023-10-12 08:52:30,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/324590576_433523865566583_2337323940646813110_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=iS98KnwmE0IAX9rePqi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCdrMk5Sno23UKNAk1cHiRRHcKpxewt6EvbvrnsYg8sNw&oe=655B491D,https://www.facebook.com/100044470238144/posts/862382848587382,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387834940_18405476314011213_1169885766089712356_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=7GIduqOEw-kAX_hjY1W&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAfRLU7C7VBx8cHnG6w7H9jRJ7N-2q0jrVGNRKRdDE2ow&oe=655B538E

facebook,"Statement From Dr Kemi Olunloyo 10/12/23 on FAKE DNA TESTSüö®üë∂üèΩ I am offline on medical leave till December 2023. According to authorities and mainstream media houses, there has been no DNA test conducted in Nigeria on Mohbad's son Liam since his father died. Wunmi Aloba is using a ""protected"" burner account and paid influencers to prove some point to the gullible public. Many Nigerians have no idea you could actually pay a blogger or influencer to push a non existent story or a pathetic lie to make it go viral. As a professional blogger since 1999 and journalist 1994, I have never been part of this deceptive practice or I would be filthy rich by now instead of always crowdfunding my work. Wunmi Aloba is simply using the manipulative lies she pushed the day Mohbad died. Naira Marley the musician who knew her well posed some disturbing questions on what happened to his former label signee. One of them caught my attention and it was ""Who paid Instablog to say it was an ear infection?"" It was Wunmi Aloba the wife who acted as family spokesperson. It has not been confirmed or denied if she actually paid the blog to push that narrative. Gistlover on the other hand rakes in millions to push false narratives. I am done with the Mohbad case and gotten what I need out of it. I will be writing articles in global magazines on the fall of the Nigerian music industry including cultism, sex and drugs, failure to take an adult man to the hospital and the destruction of surveillance cameras at his residence. I'm not a purveyor of fake news nor am I a prophetess. I investigate and analyse events carefully. If I want to tease the news I will. I teased Davido having two babies this year way before his Anita drama started. I teased the Covid death of Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff. Don't EVER affiliate me with a lawless country who have no clue what authentic news is. All the influencers who tweeted that imaginary Wunmi's DNA result is out did not post the results. Don't allow yourself to be gullible and rubbished because of your poor mentality. Even Davido who posted an old hospital room picture of his wife's 2019 delivery then quickly deleted it is the one posting today that you should stop circulating old pics. The same Davido who should have said the same in August when photos of him carrying Ifeanyi circulated as Chioma welcoming another boy. Don't let these people play mind games with you. Wake up and smell the coffee. The Nigerian police must not leave any stone unturned in unraveling all events leading to Mohbad's death including investigating his wife Wunmi who he mentioned in a conversation accusing her of trying to kill him AND post his voice notes when he's gone. I have worked in journalism since 1994 close to 30 years. Ignorance of Nigerians does not excuse stupidity. While I'm taking time off please only follow police reports. I will be back by December. I work alone with no admins. My school @2222MediaSchool has 2 instructors. The world is full of enough conflict and I don't cover wars. Take care of yourself and each other.

facebook,"As the Tiger Warrior once told, remaining loyalty while avoiding being taken advantage of are essential qualities for engaging with others. Here are some principles and strategies to help you maintain your loyalty while protecting yourself from exploitation üêÖ Embrace your warrior spirit. Cultivate a strong sense of self and honor. Understand your values and commitments, and let them guide your actions. Remain steadfast in your beliefs and goals. Assess trustworthiness. Exercise discernment when determining whom to trust. Observe people's actions, integrity, and consistency over time. Surround yourself with individuals who share your values and reciprocate loyalty. Set clear boundaries. Clearly define your personal limits and boundaries. Be assertive in communicating them to others, ensuring they understand what you will and will not tolerate. Stand firm in upholding these boundaries. Develop self-awareness. Understand your strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities. Recognize situations where you might be more susceptible to manipulation or exploitation. Self-awareness allows you to protect yourself and make wise decisions. Cultivate intuition. Trust your instincts and gut feelings. Tigers have an innate ability to sense danger. Hone this skill by paying attention to subtle cues and your intuition. If something feels off or manipulative, proceed with caution. Maintain open communication. Build trust and foster open lines of communication with those you consider worthy of your loyalty. Honest dialogue helps prevent misunderstandings and allows for effective conflict resolution. Be selective with your loyalty. Not everyone deserves your unwavering loyalty. Choose your alliances carefully, directing your loyalty toward those who prove themselves trustworthy, honorable, and reciprocate your loyalty. Practice self-care. Prioritize your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that rejuvenate you and strengthen your resilience. When you are strong and balanced, you are less likely to be taken advantage of. Seek knowledge and wisdom. Continuously educate yourself to sharpen your judgment and decision-making skills. Learn from history, literature, and the experiences of others. Wisdom empowers you to make informed choices and avoid pitfalls. Stay vigilant like a üêÖ Constantly assess your relationships and situations for signs of exploitation or manipulation. Be alert to power imbalances and people who try to exploit your loyalty for personal gain. If necessary, have a trusted confidant who can provide an objective perspective. Think about this, being loyal doesn't mean sacrificing your well-being or allowing others to take advantage of you. By embodying the spirit of a tiger warrior, you can remain fiercely loyal while safeguarding yourself from exploitation.üåü",,2579,"{'like_count': 1263, 'comment_count': 85, 'num_users': 1032597}",POSITIVE üß† PSYCHOLOGY.,,2023-10-12 11:02:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/386522267_335306325682642_4244090122022419861_n.jpg?stp=c3.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=j2Pjzgzb288AX8BqkNw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBwZ3zlM70w32JvCDmRznZcd-D7W7Yxq1VMR6cMy9lvxw&oe=655A487F,https://www.facebook.com/groups/515267860153526/permalink/918076323206009,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391684702_23879719251672036_3005701328961027711_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Zq8yS9ACDJAAX-Wfyqi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCteBDxesMOWSidq1zUkAQsmJl52_02Ge-WUXmktQPlqQ&oe=652BEA27

facebook,"Beste vrienden, Ik nam gisteren deel aan een ingetogen herdenkingsmoment van de meer dan 1.200 onschuldige Isra√´lische burgerdoden door de terroristen van Hamas. Het hoogste aantal Joodse doden sinds de Holocaust. Vrijlating We eisten de onmiddellijke vrijlating van de 150 gegijzelden, voornamelijk vrouwen en kinderen. Buiten de MR was er geen enkele politieke partij aanwezig. Jodenhaat Een paar straten verder betoogde een veelvoud pro Palestina. Je hoorde en zag er anti-joodse slogans. Socialisten, communisten en ecologisten tekenden present. Wil je genuine WOII jodenhaat zien? Ga naar een pro-Palestina betoging in een grootstad/Arabische enclave in Europa. De sympathie voor daden van terreur is tastbaar, de woede en agressie voelbaar. Jahjah Hezbollah-aanhanger en leerkracht (sic) Abu Jahjah toont intussen zijn ware gelaat en weigert de daden van Hamas te veroordelen. Baby‚Äôs onthoofden? ‚ÄòVerzet tegen de bezetter.‚Äô Doe nog een rondje, Abu. Hallucinant interview Ik gaf een interview aan de aanwezige cameraploeg van de VRT, de journaliste keek me aan, wat volgde was een redelijk hallucinant interview. ‚ÄòWaarom bent u hier?‚Äô ‚ÄòIk ben hier namens mijn partij om mijn steun en solidariteit aan het Joodse volk en de bevolking van Isra√´l te betuigen nu terroristen 1.200 Isra√´li‚Äôs over de kling hebben gejaagd.‚Äô (Ik dacht: Euhm, hoe durf je dat eigenlijk vragen?) ‚ÄòWat betekent die ‚Äòsteun‚Äô‚Äô? ‚ÄòWat bedoel je?‚Äô ‚ÄòWel, wat betekent die steun, die solidariteit?‚Äô ‚ÄòGeloof me als ik u zeg dat de bevolking van Isra√´l en het Joodse volk wereldwijde steunbetuigingen op dit ogenblik h√©√©l belangrijk vinden.‚Äô ‚ÄòEn wat dan met de Palestijnen?‚Äô ‚ÄòKijk mevrouw, na de aanslagen van Al Qaida op 9/11 hebben wij onze steun toch ook betuigd aan de Verenigde Staten? En toen wij hier aangevallen werden door IS in de metro in Maalbeek en op onze luchthaven, hebben wij toch ook steunbetuigingen gekregen? Wat is het verschil?‚Äô ‚ÄòEr vallen toch ook Palestijnse burgerslachtoffers?‚Äô ‚ÄòDenkt u dat er bij de vergeldingsacties tegen Al Qaida na 9/11 in Afghanistan geen burgerdoden gevallen zijn? Denkt u dat er na de aanslagen in Europa en de strijd tegen IS geen burgerdoden gevallen zijn? Hamas gebruikt mensen als schild, haar raketlanceerders en militaire commandocentra liggen bewust in ziekenhuizen en cr√®ches. Dat is tegen het internationaal oorlogsrecht, maar daar trekken ze zich al jaren niets van aan. Als er bij een vergeldingsactie dan burgerdoden vallen, wiens schuld is dat dan?‚Äô Ik denk niet dat dit kruisverhoor uitgezonden werd. Misschien moeten ze dat toch maar eens doen.

facebook,"LA LONGUE ROUTE DES TROIS ABRAHAM Cette photo. prise en 1999, alors que je faisais un reportage pour le National geographic sur le p√®re fondateur des trois religions Abraham a une histoire particuli√®re. Dans le contexte d'horreur absolue, cette image fait-elle preuve d'un ang√©lisme d√©plac√© quand tout est chaos, violence, terrorisme, carnage, haine, terreur? Je reste persuad√© que nous devons encore et toujours, et plus aujourd'hui qu'avant, ≈ìuvrer pour ce semblant de paix. Si nous ne croyons pas en une fr√™le lueur, m√™me un petit peu, alors nous renon√ßons. Nous avons un engagement pour le pr√©sent et les g√©n√©rations √† venir. L'HISTOIRE DE CETTE PHOTOGRAPHIE Si pr√®s de nous, il est une terre sur laquelle vivent chr√©tiens, musulmans, juifs. L√†-bas, les enfants sont souvent √©lev√©s dans l'incompr√©hension de l‚Äôautre. Du plus loin que les textes se souviennent, Abraham reste le p√®re fondateur de ces trois religions, le p√®re de ses enfants qui se sont dresses l'un contre l'autre Je faisais un reportage sur Abraham, son voyage, son histoire et celle qu‚Äôil a l√©gu√©e. Tel un symbole de paix, j‚Äôai cherch√© trois enfants des trois religions, Abraham, chez les chr√©tiens, Ibrahim, chez les musulmans, Avram, chez les juifs. Si le pr√©nom est r√©pandu, j‚Äôai rencontr√© pendant un mois toutes les difficult√©s √† r√©unir ces trois enfants. La rencontre √©tait remise au gr√© des f√™tes religieuses, du blocus des rues ou du refus d‚Äôun propri√©taire de voir un enfant de l'autre camp franchir le seuil de sa maison et poser sur sa terrasse. Oui, cette id√©e pacifique et id√©aliste que je voulais illustrer a n√©cessit√© bien des combats pour devenir r√©alit√©. Un jour trois enfants que la m√©moire d‚Äôune terre, que le souvenir d‚Äôun p√®re, pouvaient r√©unir, mais que tout s√©pare, se sont retrouv√©s. Ibrahim, Avram et Abraham, le temps d‚Äôune photographie, ont fait revivre le message perdu de paix du P√®re. Trois enfants d‚ÄôAbraham: un juif, un musulman et un chr√©tien devant le D√¥me du Rocher et le mur des Lamentations. Il faut toujours s‚Äôobstiner.. Depuis 1999, je poursuis ma qu√™te visuelle dans le monde sur ce qui rassemble quand l'√©poque ne parle que de division. THE LONG ROAD OF THE THREE ABRAHAM This photograph taken in 1999, when I was reporting for National Geographic on the founding father of the three religions Abraham, has a special story. In the context of absolute horror, does this image demonstrate a misplaced angelism when everything is chaos, violence, terrorism, carnage, hatred, terror? I remain convinced that we must still and always, and more today than before, work for this semblance of peace. If we don't believe in even a little glimmer of light, then we give up. We have a commitment to the present and future generations. THE STORY BEHIND THIS PHOTOGRAPH There is a land, so close to our own, where Christians, Jews and Muslims live. Over there, children are often raised without any comprehension of the other‚Äôs religions. As the most ancient texts attest, Abraham is a founding father of all three of these religions, a father whose children are in conflict with each other. I was doing a reportage on Abraham for National Geographic, his journey, his history, and his legacy. As a symbol of peace, I sought out three children from each of these religions: the Christian boy was named Abraham, the Jewish boy, Avram, and the Muslim boy, Ibrahim. While the first name is a common one, I nevertheless had no end of difficulties getting these three children together. The obstacles facing our meeting ranged from religious festivals, roadblocks, and the refusal of a homeowner to admit a child of another faith cross the threshold of his home in order to pose for a photo on his terrace. Indeed, my idealistic concept, based upon a desire for peace, faced many challenges before it became a reality. One day, three children whose memories of a land and a father could unite them, but whom everything separates, managed to meet for a moment to pose for a photograph. Ibrahim, Avram and Abraham made the lost message of peace from their namesake live again, if only for that brief time. These three children, bearing the name of Abraham, posed in front of the Dome of the Rock and the Wailing Wall. One must not give up, this photo is proof. Since 1999, when I did this reportage on Abraham for National Geographic, I have continued to pursue my visual quest throughout the world for that which brings us together, even at a time when only division is evoked in the name of God #peace #paix #israel #palestine",,2324,"{'like_count': 1231, 'comment_count': 56, 'num_users': 93823}",Reza Photojournalist,,2023-10-12 09:31:44,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/125094384_209594570537517_1075709388415589930_n.jpg?stp=c11.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=gANSxPTKBJ4AX9HTmIP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBBNBOQJycPvmWjdcFwpnIzYhW3ONa3C59DZWbVr3FMlA&oe=657D1C13,https://www.facebook.com/100044609251581/posts/872863654210602,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391753114_18388704007015137_4279630608783410019_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=jwKETU01pf0AX8OuK31&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfADKOCOuManOZ928ob2zNqbfeyMOj8hWxH7-xyJhUGbrA&oe=65597612

He added that in Bosnia, NATO continues to support the EU-led operation Althea, which plays a key role for regional stability. On Iraq, NATO‚Äôs mission is evolving to provide more support to the Iraqi security forces. On deterrence and defence, Allies discussed the next steps in operationalising NATO‚Äôs new defence plans, including by assigning forces, developing new capabilities, and adjusting command and control.

facebook,"I‚Äôve been called a ‚ÄúZionist shill,‚Äù ignorant, a neocon, disgusting, without empathy, pro-genocide and more ‚Äî by hundreds of people on social media - in the last two days simply for denouncing Hamas and calling for prayer and support for the people of Israel. I‚Äôve also expressed concern and asked for prayer for innocents in Gaza. Doesn‚Äôt matter, the anger spewed - from Leftist pro-aborts to conservative Christians (!!) - seems undeterred. I don‚Äôt care personally as I‚Äôm used to online ignorant hate. Yet it reveals the sheer ignorance, moral blindness and foolish nonsense filling people‚Äôs hearts and minds right now. And that concerns me. I‚Äôm not the ultimate target of their hate and disgust. Israel and Jews are. Some things are not complicated. Terrorism is always wrong and never justified. And an act of terrorist murder is profoundly morally distinct from a tragic unintended civilian casualty in an urban war - especially one where innocents are used as human shields by their own leaders. One can argue about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict all day but the moral equivalencies, denials and outright hate being spewed is disgusting. Don‚Äôt be part of it. Be sober minded. Seek moral, factual clarity. Open your eyes.

facebook,"The most powerful country in the Middle East is livid with pain, fear and anger. I do not have the knowledge or moral authority to speak about how things look from the Palestinian perspective. But in the moment of Israel‚Äôs greatest pain, I would like to issue a warning about how things look from the Israeli side of the fence. Many of the forces in the region are currently led by irresponsible religious fanatics. External forces must therefore intervene to de-escalate the conflict. Anyone who wishes for peace must unequivocally condemn the Hamas atrocities, put pressure on Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release all the hostages , and help deter Hezbollah and Iran from intervening.

facebook,"The Struggle to Come Out From the World by J.C. Ryle To come out from the world is not an easy thing. It cannot be easy so long as human nature is what it is, and a busy devil is always near us. It requires a constant struggle and exertion; it entails incessant conflict and self-denial; it often places us in exact opposition to members of our own families, friends and neighbors; it sometimes obliges us to do things which give great offence, and bring on us ridicule and petty persecution. It is precisely this which makes many hang back and shrink from decided religion. They know they are not right; they know that they are not so ‚Äúthorough‚Äù in Christ‚Äôs service as they ought to be, and they feel uncomfortable and ill at ease. But the fear of man keeps them back. And so they linger on through life with aching, dissatisfied hearts, ‚Äì with too much religion to be happy in the world, and too much of the world to be happy in their religion.

facebook,"I think there's just too much pressure that people put on the word Love. Like it's just supposed to solve everything. Like it's a cure all to every problem and that just by saying ""I love you"" everything magically becomes okay. But then why do so many of us look for someone else to talk to when something goes wrong? Why do we seek out someone who maybe be more willing to listen to what we are going through and give us advice? Why do we want someone who understands what we are going through rather than just someone who tells us they love us? It's so hard to be one person, now imagine what it's like having to deal with all the emotions of two. And maybe that's why people are always so unsure about love. Why things go down hill so often when there is a fight. Why they run away from any kind of conflict. And why we seek out the company of old friends who have known us for a while to sit with and talk to. It's hard to open up to someone and harder still when it's about something that scares you. And I know love scares you. Losing someone you care about scares you. Which is why sometimes just being understanding of someone's emotions, of their fears, of what they are going through in life is enough. Friends who share memes are sometimes even more appreciated that one's who share love notes. Because sometimes, understanding is just better than love. __ scene by @artalanche_ridhigupta for The Scribbled Stories",,1245,"{'like_count': 426, 'comment_count': 15, 'num_users': 2485107}",The Scribbled Stories,,2023-10-12 08:43:57,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/156795772_239759271148728_2031564541491135616_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=3Y0Zoe8aIuAAX_WJ67i&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCp530z3DVT8TB38Q0kJA7RO8PLWpA4qBhoPtrSzAYI5w&oe=657D3053,https://www.facebook.com/100053439695846/posts/857986659325983,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391726461_18359431288078250_6481025104861469960_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=CZJbBSQEUlMAX-WoSxD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBHvdMb4JK5UyOWnPZgeUt3AjdEWQwBnLxGFd-YGzfk1g&oe=654DA2ED

facebook,"God we pray for peace in Israel üôèüèº üáÆüá± What does the Bible say about the conflict in Israel?  Jesus said in Matthew 24, ‚ÄúYou will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don‚Äôt panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won‚Äôt follow immediately.  Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.  But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.  Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.  And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.  And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.  Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.  But the one who endures to the end will be saved.‚Äù (Matthew 24:6-13)  

The first thing I notice about this passage is the command of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt panic.‚Äù Our job as Christians is to not be caught up with the rest of the world with the spirit of fear. ‚ÄúGod has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.‚Äù (2 Tim. 1:7)  The second thing I notice about this passage is Jesus telling us when we hear of ‚Äúwars and rumors of wars‚Äù that ‚Äúthe end won‚Äôt follow immediately.‚Äù We might be living in the end times, but this is not the end of the end according to Jesus.  The third thing I notice here is Jesus‚Äô stern warning against false prophets.  It‚Äôs easy when there is fear and turmoil to cling to words that make us feel good, but they may not necessarily be what the Bible says.  Beware of false teachers, be grounded in the word of God.  This is no time to follow popular opinions.  This is a time to stand on God‚Äôs word.

So what's our assignment as Christians?
Jesus says in Luke 19:13, ""Occupy until I come."" The end times are not a time to sit on your rapture rug and wait until Jesus comes back. The end times are for a glorious church to rise and to rule and reign with Christ as ""kings and priests unto our God."" (Rev. 1:6) Now is the time to take our royal authority over the darkness, to push back the darkness, to contend for souls, to go to war with our prayers and spiritual weapons. Jesus is not coming back for a weak bride. Jesus is coming back for a warrior bride. Now is the time to take authority over the darkness and to push back the gates of hell with our prayers.

So when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't panic. Jesus said this is not the end of the end. Occupy until Christ comes. Push back the gates of hell with your prayers and weapons of warfare. Stand on the word and sound doctrine. And remember your prayers are more powerful than you realize. They can pull down the demonic strongholds in the earth, which in turn changes the physical realm. When we go after the kingdom of hell in prayer, we will begin to see the victory in the physical realm as well. Pray for Israel. Pray for the nations of the world. Pray bold prayers and take authority over the dark powers and demons. Christ gave you that authority. The church is the hope of the world. ""Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.""

facebook,"¬©Ô∏è When I and my fiancee were dating, we had gone a whole year without quarreling Yes! One whole year, without arguing... Just when I was thinking of proposing to her, a thought crossed my mind ""We have never quarrelled before, are you sure we can cope with the conflict that comes with marriage?"" I asked myself... Funny enough, I tried sparking up arguments whenever she visited, complained bitterly about anything she did but it didn't work She would either tell me ""I'm sorry my love, you know I didn't mean to offend you"" and smile that her irresistible smile and before I realise, I would be smiling myself... Or she would look at me with her baby face until I apologize. She never shouted back or spoke rudely...until one day, I made the mistake of asking her why she never picked a quarrel ""You never shout or speak back at me, you're always too cool...I don't know if you will even be able to handle conflict in marriage sef..."" I complained She looked at me, shocked and surprised at the same time... ""So you want us to be quarreling?"" She asked ""No, but...you know, arguments bring better understanding in relationships"" I explained bluntly ""You think I don't understand you enough?"" She asked, still calm By then I realised I was just being stupid...I kept mute ""No problem, you've asked for it"" she said Gbam. I started apologizing immediately but she gave deaf ears...a part of still wanted the drama to happen so I left her alone after pleading for some time I left for my room and waited for her to come and meet me but she stayed in the living room for almost an hour... Then she finally came to the room with a very strong face... ""Come and eat"" ...TBC...

facebook,"How many times do you feel triggered in your relationship, have an urge to respond habitually in a way that doesn‚Äôt work, recognize the urge and choose to do something new‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but not know what do instead? This is a very stuck feeling and definitely adds another layer of anxiety to the situation. My intention with this post is to provide you with some new options to work on. As you read through, try to visualize how you might implement these strategies into a familiar conflict between you and your partner. Visualizing can help your brain pathways wire around a new event, even if the new event isn‚Äôt taking place physically. This gives you the opportunity to practice new behaviors and feelings (conjuring up the feeling of empathy, for example) so you‚Äôre better prepared when tough situations arise. #thesecurerelationship #thesecurerelationshipmft #secureattachment #securelove #emotionallyunavailable #emotionalsupport #emotionsmatter #emotionallyavailable #emotionalwellbeing #communicationiskey #codependencia #codependent #marriage101 #marriagecoach #couplescoaching #traumarecovery #secureattachment #avoidantattachment #secureattachmentstyle #secureattachments #disorganized #disorganizedattachment #anxiousattachmentstyle #anxiousattachment",,995,"{'like_count': 381, 'comment_count': 31, 'num_users': 90530}",The Secure Relationship,,2023-10-12 02:19:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/395227601_646369007618921_1944132037307077622_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Eltpp0__pUcAX8KhEWQ&_nc_oc=AQlCqgojLYRxQTHtn208zmpuSohXQ5gAKOs3VZSwjN8rmF-2lsvnldLImeR_Mo6CiXY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDDDNEucDDJ4-0cDj5lSdkemc-zfvCRD66pZKRQtmsNHQ&oe=655AB46E,https://www.facebook.com/100067374829182/posts/639329201656235,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387060528_18002353631118076_2601811466908877098_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=MPFTEzi96XIAX_TmgXi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDVKWlKvm5AeYNh9V1yi9Tl5x4YqgeDC7P656DvM0swfw&oe=652D29DB

facebook,"[Middle East] I spoke today about the Israel-Hamas conflict. I made the following points: 1. The Hamas attack was violent and cruel, and is a clear act of terrorism. We have to condemn it unequivocally. No ifs and buts. 2. One can deeply sympathise with the plight of the Palestinian people. One can deplore the treatment they have received. But that should not stop us from condemning Hamas' extreme acts of terrorism. 3. Israel's reaction is going to be severe. I said that countries expect Israel to comply with international law, and international rules of war. 4. We are stepping up our security measures in Singapore. 5. The peace, and racial and religious harmony, in Singapore is precious. We have it not by accident. We have worked hard for it, and we should not let events outside divide us. Whatever our sympathies, in Singapore, we should stay united, not let external events divide us.

facebook,"LATEST NEWS: DPS Urges Texans to Report Suspicious Activity After Recent Attacks Against Israel

AUSTIN ‚Äì The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is responding to Texas Governor Greg Abbott‚Äôs directive this week to work with local partners and federal intelligence agencies on heightened public safety measures in light of the recent attacks against Israel.

At this time, DPS is not aware of any specific and credible threats to Texas. However, the department does have concerns the current conflict could inspire homegrown violent extremists and foreign terrorist organizations operating in the United States to target the Jewish community and institutions associated with Israel outside of the Middle East.

The department encourages Texans to remain vigilant at all times and report any suspicious activity via iWatchTexas. Tips can be reported via iwatchtx.org, the free iOS or Android mobile app or by calling 844-643-2251. All reports are confidential. 

Remember, iWatchTexas is not for emergencies. If there is an emergency, call 911 immediately.

facebook,"#emotional aspects of Arthritis, Bronchitis, Headaches, Frozen shoulder and Insomnia! Often, tuning into and recognizing the thoughts, emotions and attitudes which have contributed to the problem can begin your healing process. This is 1. Because when you acknowledge what has been suppressed you begin the process of release. And 2. Awareness - equals choice. Choice gives you an opportunity to reflect on your life, become aware of what does not work and potentially change it. Healing encompasses every aspect of your being, including your physical health and fitness, emotional wellbeing, mental attitude, energetic welfare, spiritual wisdom and strength. It is important to recognize that your body (including finer bodies, soul and spirit) is not your enemy; but a messenger which can help you to know yourself more fully. Here are some ailments and what can potentially cause them. Arthritis ‚Äì holding onto anger and resentment from the past. Carrying guilt, remorse and shame. Difficulty in forgiving self and others. Complaining about life; worrying, but not wanting to make changes. Feeling stuck and limited. (Has to start working on inner openness and flexibility!) Bronchitis ‚Äì feeling too much pressure. Conflict and anger in the family, which leads to irritation with people close to you. Blaming others for what you can‚Äôt fix or control. Needing time out and time to yourself. Feeling a lack of appreciation and love. Pushing people away. (Need to develop healthy boundaries and take time for self!) Headaches ‚Äì stress, overwhelm, tiredness, seriousness, too much going on. Feeling out of control. Self criticism, judgment, invalidation, self sabotage. Too much thinking and analysis. Overcrowded, frustrated, undermined. (Need to learn how to be more objective and more grounded!) Frozen shoulder ‚Äì suppressing your feelings. Experiencing too much strain, stress and worry. Not dealing with your challenges ‚Äò numbing‚Äô them. Feeling stuck, trying to control rather than allow. Fear of the future. Wanting to give up. Feeling like a failure. Engulfed by problems. Not knowing how to heal your pain and sadness. Represents frozen tears. (Allow yourself to breathe and feel. Focus on self and let others become responsible for themselves!) Insomnia ‚Äì can‚Äôt relax, feeling unsafe, unable to let go. Worrying, playing over things in your mind, dissecting situations. Feeling scattered, fearful. (Sleep is vital - how you prepare for sleep depends on how you live your day. Turn off all media, listen to classical music, meditate and learn about what really happens when you sleep.) When we are working on healing a condition we need to identify the difference between the thoughts, patterns, points of view, actions and emotions. Let‚Äôs take the lungs for example. A tendency to put self last - is an action. However we have to identify the thoughts which are connected. I.e I‚Äôm not good enough. I‚Äôm not important. I don‚Äôt deserve to have.... (complete this.) This leads us to a point of view of either a victim or a self saboteur. So when positive things occur, a pattern appears where we always sabotage, punish and take away from ourselves. Instead of having healthy boundaries and knowing when to say yes or no. We just keep saying yes and draining more and more of our precious life force. The emotions which are working underneath all this are sadness, anguish, rejection and hurt. There is so much to discover about your inner being and the wisdom of your body, soul and spirit. I‚Äôll be teaching my last live workshop in Queensland this Nov for a while.

facebook,"In the most devastating incident in Israel's 75-year history, more than 1,200 lives were tragically lost, while Gaza also reported approximately 900 casualties. A relentless barrage of rockets has left hundreds of thousands of people displaced, and it has also had a profound impact on many animals, leaving them terrified and traumatized. Those who have survived this harrowing attack are desperately searching for their families, scraps of food, and a safe place to hide. Our partner, Let The Animals Live (LTAL), is an organization operating a shelter and clinic in Ashkelon, Israel's major port city, which has regrettably been a repeated target of Hamas rocket attacks. To date, LTAL has successfully evacuated 32 sick and injured dogs and cats from war-torn Ashkelon to their shelter located in Kfar Ruth, central Israel. LTAL, in collaboration with veterinarians and essential supplies, is heading south to provide aid to animals in need. While some areas may be inaccessible, your generous donations will support the provision of crucial supplies to dedicated volunteers. These animals are frightened, starving, and in dire need of YOUR support. Please take action by donating today: https://bit.ly/3Fc2tBC.:=:https://networkforanimals.org/donation/ It's important to emphasize that our focus is solely on providing care and assistance to animals affected by this tragic situation and that they are not part of the ongoing conflict. We do not endorse or participate in any form of violence or warfare.

Fjala e plot√´ e Kryeministrit, nj√´herit Kryetarit t√´ LV-s√´, Albin Kurti: Dear President of the Party of European Socialists, Mr. Stefan Lofven, Dear members of the PES Presidency, Dear representatives of the European sister parties, As I feel the spirit of a common family, it is a source of particular pleasure and pride for me to present to you briefly my party, in my capacity as its leader. As you know, Kosova is a new state. We declared our independence on 17 February 2008, so around 10 years after the start of a bloody conflict, a war of liberation after a decade of systemic repression and discrimination by the regime then led by president Slobodan Milosevic, which culminated with genocidal campaign. In that respect, without commenting further on later periods, and despite the fact that all of our parties are deeply rooted in the legacies of justice and social struggles, let me emphasize that the Self-Determination Movement also follows from a long tradition of struggle for fundamental rights, justice and equality, which, generation after generation, were never granted to the majority Albanian population of Kosova. These were the main values that motivated the establishment of the then-Kosova Action Network once I was released from Serbia's prisons. This civil society organization then transformed into a full-fledged opposition political movement in 2005. Beginning with the parliamentary election of 2010, and at every subsequent election, the Self-Determination Movement has only increased its share of votes, becoming therefore: the third-largest political force in 2014, and the strongest in 2017, with this outcome confirmed in the early elections of 2019. Though my government was overthrown in 2020 through outside interference - with the dangerous aim of attempting to resolve the dispute with Serbia by means of a territorial partition - my party was elected once again to the executive, with a strong majority in the Parliament in February 2021. Nowadays, support for our party is greater than March 2021 when we‚Äôve been elected. The program we were elected for, and for which we are legitimately obliged towards our citizens, has two main components: jobs and justice, because without access to those basics, there is no possibility to build up a healthy society where every individual can choose her or his life and emancipate herself or himself. It is ambitious and requires thorough and long-term reforms, which are, as you know, all required for our resolute path toward European integration: These are reforms in the areas of rule of law and democratization. In that respect, I am very proud that within only two and a half years, the Republic of Kosova has seen clear improvements in all relevant international rankings, making it first in the region for: rule of law according to the World Justice Project; political rights and civil liberties according to Freedom House; the fight against corruption according to Transparency International; media freedom according to Reporters without Borders; and the quality of liberal and electoral democracy according to V-Dem Institute's Varieties of Democracy index. Together with a letter addressed recently to the PES's leadership, I have listed some of our social-democratic achievements and policies. Among them, let me emphasize that, thanks to a sound fiscal policy linked to a strong fight against corruption, the IMF has ranked Kosova best in the region for revenue collection, but also for public finance management, according to SIGMA/OECD's consortium, contracted by the European Commission. Our economic and fiscal success has (truncated)",,645,"{'like_count': 594, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 390527}",L√´vizja VET√ãVENDOSJE!,,2023-10-12 17:18:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/278837999_356310083201915_654320042486626475_n.jpg?stp=c290.290.500.500a_cp0_dst-jpg_s50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=EsDZC9VSqFcAX-5jjA0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMfVyn6FUBiJjs86jPxqjRz9ure3wlZv9xZKSc11ftsQ&oe=655B7C6F,https://www.facebook.com/100064687781495/posts/718411673658419,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391751205_718408210325432_1440361345411633632_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=4R4ydDOxx0sAX_IL9zH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCF2guL2o9PXzsd5svQIsSG8KaPC46vZnXeV9SQ42xmiA&oe=654B35E7

Isabel is not convinced that she wants to continue with her marriage and tells An√≠bal to stay, because she is the one who needs to leave. üí•Carlos tells Elisa that Carolina escaped from them again and that it was V√≠ctor who helped her take her son but that he already paid for it because he gave him what he deserved. üí•Uriel is free, Alejandra waits for him outside the town jail and assures him that he got out thanks to Iker, since it was he who convinced his father to help him. Uriel thanks Iker for his help while Daniel forces Alejandra to stay away from Uriel because it is now his responsibility and he is not going to allow something similar to happen again. Laughable how Daniel want Alejandra to stay away from Uriel yet he can't stay away from Isabel,what a hypocrite üí•Arturo accepts Alba's conditions and puts the clinic's shares up for sale before being able to transfer them to Sergio. Rodolfo asks his wife to reconsider, but Alba is willing to keep the clinic to be the only one who makes decisions without having to ask the Oteros for permission.

Mijn bedoeling was niet om samen met jullie het volk Isra√´l te verheerlijken. Dat gebeurde in de Bijbelse tijd ook niet. Maar wel om nog meer na te denken en met elkaar van gedachten te wisselen over wat er allemaal gaande is. En daar heb je kennis voor nodig. Je hoort hoe scholen moeite hebben het conflict uit te leggen. Maar dat is hard nodig. Er is veel meer aan de hand dan de verschrikkelijke beelden ons dagelijks laten zien. Probeer aan de kinderen uit te leggen wat er gaande is. Luister en kijk naar verantwoorde programma‚Äôs. En wat dacht u van de kerk!!! Ik hoop echt dat in de kerken a.s. zondag massaal gebeden gaat worden: Heer ontferm u. Ik heb tot nu toe nog geen aandacht gevraagd voor Palestijnse christenen. Ook hun lot is onder het bewind van de streng Islamitische Hamas als maar verslechterd. Hun aantal schijnt ook enorm afgenomen te zijn. Jullie kennen ze niet? Ik denk toch dat meerdere van jullie de naam Jemima kennen. Misschien hebben sommige van jullie in Betlehem gewerkt. Daar kwam je nog wel eens Palestijnse christenen tegen. Maar of die er nog in de Gazastrook zijn? Ik weet het niet. Betlehem waar de gebouwen van Jemina staan, behoort tot de West Bank. Wat staat er in de wereld allemaal te gebeuren?

facebook,"We are extremely saddened to report that 'Dada', one of the adult lionesses of the Marsh Pride, was most likely a victim of Human-Wildlife Conflict (HWC) recently. Early in the month, Governors' Camp guides noticed an open wound in her side and although she was found relaxing with her cubs and appeared to be somewhat unaffected by her injury, the scenario was definitely cause for concern. We alerted the vets from the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (SWT) who are based at the Mara Research Station inside the National Reserve. They responded and met us at Governors‚Äô Camp and from there we led them to the pride. Dada was darted and the pride quickly dispersed, with two of the females carefully leading her two young cubs away. It was about 15 minutes before the anaesthetic took its full effect on Dada and because she was darted amongst thick vegetation, we had to pull her out into the open. Anaesthesia lasts only one hour; so that meant there was just 45 minutes remaining. Dr Njoroge of SWT worked fast and efficiently to clean, disinfect and suture the wound, leaving a small opening for drainage. Antibiotics were also administered. After about 20 minutes, Dada was given a reversal agent to wake up. After looking around for some time, she pulled herself up and began calling for her cubs - thankfully she was reunited with them soon after. The following morning we found her and the rest of the pride feeding on a buffalo that they had taken down during the night. Dada is expected to make a full recovery and we thank Dr Njoroge and his team for treating her. Incidents like this are sadly becoming more and more frequent and are very concerning and upsetting for all involved. It is important to note that Governors' Camp has no official mandate that allows us to actively protect these lions (or any other wildlife) and that unfortunately, there is very little by way of monitoring that we can provide for these lions, during the night. We therefore focus on other ways of mitigating HWC such as community education and outreach programs, sponsoring the salaries for Lion Ambassadors, covering the costs of a lion collar and donating predator deterrent lights. We are of course truly saddened by this event that is no doubt distressing for a mother lion and her cubs and so we are actively working as a team to see what more we can do.

Ang anak ni Isaac ay si Jacob(Ya‚Äôqoob) kung saan ang karamihan sa mga Propeta ay nagmula sa kanyang angkan tulad ni Yusof(Joseph),Daud(David),Sulaiman(Solomon),Zakariyyah(Zacarias),Musa(Moses)Yahya(John). 

Ang pangalawang pangalan ni Propeta ishaq(Isaac) ay ISRAEL kaya tinatawag ang kanyang mga angkan na BANU ISRAEL(Son‚Äôs of Israel). 

Ngunit nakilala na ang angkan ni Israel sa pagsuway at katigasan ng ulo kung saan sila ang kumakalaban at pumapatay sa mismong mga Propeta na ipinadala sakanila maliban sa kakaunting bilang na mga nanamapalataya sakanila kasama ang mga Propeta,ganito ang pagdescribe ng Quran sakanila.

Kabilang sa kanilang pagsuway ay: 
-Sinuway nila si Propeta Solaiman(Solomon)
-Sinuway nila si Propeta Musa(Moses) 
-Sinuway nila si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) 
-Sila ang pumatay kay Propeta Yahya(John)
-Sila ang pumatay kay Propeta Zacariah(Zacarias).

KAYA PINARUSAHAN SILA NG ALLAH KUNG SAAN ANG NAGING PARUSA NILA AY WALA SILANG LUPA SA MUNDONG ITO MALIBAN SA MGA NANANAMPALATAYA SAKANILA.

Ang nangyari sakanila sa loob ng ilang siglo ay kung saan-saan sila napadpad sa middles east pagkatapos ng panahon ni Propeta Eisa(Jesus),ang iba ay napunta sa Europe at America. 

Sa World War II sa pagitan ng taon 1941 at 1945 ay nangyari ang Holocaust kung saan namatay ang halos 6 millions na hudyo sa Europa sa kamay ni Adolf Hitler ng Germany. 

Ang dahilan ng malaking galit na ito ni Adolf Hitler sa mga hudyo ay tungkol sa political at religion kung saan ang paniniwala ng mga hudyo sa mga taong hindi kabilang sakanila ay mga hayop o pinakamababang nilalang,dahil nga naniniwala sila na sila nga ang chosen people na pinili ng Allah,kaya ginawa ito sakanila ni Hitler.

Nagkaroon lang naman sila ng lupa sa Palestine dahil naawa ang GREAT BRITAIN sakanila kung saan nirekomenda ito sa UNITED NATIONS at agad naman ito natanggap ng UN sa taong 1947,sapagat matagal din nanilbihan ang mga hudyo sa Great Britain.

Sa sumunod na taon(1948) ay nagdeklara kaagad ang mga Zionist Jews ng kanilang sariling bansa sa Palestine na tinawag nilang ISRAEL kung saan parang kailan lng yung pagdating nila sa Palestine bilang mga refugees hanggang sa paunti-unti na nilang pinapalawak ang kanilang lupain sa pagsakop sa mga lupain ng mga palestino sa dahas at sapilitan na paraan,kasabay nun ay inipon nila ang lahat ng mga hudyo sa buong mundo kung saan dati-rati ay magkakawatakwatak dahil sa parusa sakanila ng Allah.

Dito na nanghimasok ang mga bansang Arabo at nagkaron ng digmaan na di matapos tapos hanggang ngayon sa pagitan ng mga JEWS at ARABS.

Bukod sa conflict na ito ay di rin ginagalang ng mga jews ang mga arabo dahil naniniwala silang mga alipin lng sila kaya hindi sila naniwala kay Propeta Muhammad SAW at madali lng sakanila pumaslang ng arabong Muslim. Bakit? 

Si Propeta Ismael na kapatid ni Propeta Isaac ay anak ni Hajar na pangalawang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim na dating kasambahay ni Sarah na nanay naman ni Propeta Isaac na unang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim(ayun sa kanilang kasaysayan).

At pagkatapos ng paghahari ng mga angkan ni Isaac kung saan ang pinaka huling Propeta sakanila ay si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) ay binigay naman ng Allah ang pangako na ito sa angkan ni Propeta Ismael kung saan magmumula sa kanyang angkan ang huling propeta at Sugo na si Propeta Muhammad SAW.

Dahil nga hindi nanggaling sa angkan ni Isaac ang huling Propeta ay hindi naniwala ang mga hudyo,sa paniniwalang mababa lng si Propeta Ismael kumpara sakanilang ninuno na si Propeta Isaac na anak mula sa unang asawa ni Propeta Ibrahim,bukod doon ay talagang palasuway sila sa mga Propeta kahit noon pa.

Sa madaling salita,ang nangyayaring conflict sa pagitan ng Jews at Arab Muslims ay sa religion at history. 

Ang Palestine ay lugar ng mga arabong Muslim,at mga nanampalataya sa mga angkan ni Israel,hindi rito kabilang ang mga sumuway,di sila kabilang sa pangako ng Allah. 

Tatlo ang umiiral na relihiyon sa Palestine:
1.Judaism
2.Christianity
3.Islam

BAKIT HINDI KABILANG ANG MGA CHRISTIANS SA PALESTINE SA KAAWAY NG MGA PALESTINONG MUSLIM? 

Ang mga kristiyano ay hindi tulad ng mga hudyo,kung saan mas malala ang hudyo ngunit iisang lahi lng sila,tinuturing din ng mga hudyo na kaaway ang mga kristiyano dahil hindi naman talaga sila naniwala kay Propeta Eisa(Jesus), sila ang nagparatang kay Maria na nakagawa raw ng pangangalunya(Zinah) at si Propeta Eisa(Jesus) ay anak sa zinah kaya nangyari ang malaking himala mula sa (truncated)",,568,"{'like_count': 208, 'comment_count': 26, 'num_users': 51673}",Yusuf Ortiz,,2023-10-12 03:15:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/380150063_727011176117250_6223433106918919859_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=wQk5sdN2yoUAX92MDeJ&_nc_oc=AQkhA1XUbr9LXc8iXZmXntQTGmJKjyw66wYDJRYf7K-5oavfXu9uyXhhB_777nJjx4w&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB62V2JQJwhJx125FoAWzelBceGiBAvizusPo87PBQbhg&oe=655A36FA,https://www.facebook.com/100064251212497/posts/739188694899498,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387834388_3472801919639426_3180949267553247_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Of_4jch3WgYAX-Ht_Xt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC_TR8nrWA7oWzTfkvQssjdLs05OiDYLripjnElvgsVBw&oe=652D4C89

facebook,"As western media outlets emphasize the tragic loss of 40 innocent Israeli children, they should uphold impartiality by also covering the devastating deaths of 260 innocent Palestinian children in recent days. Additionally, it's crucial for them to shed light on the distressing fact that, since 2000, over 2,300 Palestinian children have lost their lives due to actions by Israeli forces and settlers. By not doing so, a concerning bias is apparent, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the conflict's human impact and perpetuating a skewed narrative. By giving prominence to the deaths of one group of children, it implicitly conveys a message about the perceived value of the lives of the others. In striving for fair and comprehensive reporting, media outlets play a critical role in shaping public understanding of complex conflicts like the Israeli-Palestinian struggle. The tragedy of innocent lives lost knows no boundaries, and every child's death is a heart-wrenching event that warrants equal attention and empathy, regardless of their nationality or origin. By providing a balanced account of the human toll, media can help foster a more informed and empathetic global discourse, encouraging dialogue and ultimately contributing to a path of understanding and peace amidst this longstanding conflict. The responsibility lies not only in reporting the facts but also in acknowledging and valuing every life affected by the strife, nurturing a narrative of compassion and humanity. Furthermore, in the pursuit of balanced journalism, if the media is committed to interviewing Palestinian leaders and questioning their stance on condemning attacks on Israel, it is imperative for them to exhibit the same level of due diligence by posing analogous inquiries to Israeli authorities. Asking Israeli authorities whether they condemn the killing of innocent civilians in Palestine and the longstanding system of apartheid is essential to ensure a fair and unbiased representation of perspectives. Such symmetry in questioning helps foster an equitable narrative that considers the views and actions of all parties involved, encouraging a more comprehensive understanding of the complex issues at hand.",,566,"{'like_count': 222, 'comment_count': 41, 'num_users': 72437}",Stacey Patton,,2023-10-12 20:54:35,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-1/10885299_10152611292461094_6035046969872688128_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=dc538f&_nc_ohc=mSy-a1W0KGgAX98KY-g&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCvWwGTnoItJL3fF0ozeo3PI8y7LQlZuCNg3lZ8opqy4w&oe=657D3C88,https://www.facebook.com/stacey.patton.9/posts/10160031489906094,
facebook,"Some important context on Israel/Palestine, from @RedPrecariat: ""I see a lot of socialists pointing out that Israel 'created' Hamas. While there is truth to that, it's reductionist and counterproductive to bring up in most cases when discussing this conflict with people. The rise of religious nationalism within the Palestinian movement was driven by two key and connected events: 1) Gorbachev coming to power. 2) The Oslo Accords. As we all know, the USSR had been the patron of many liberation movements around the world, including the leftist-secular PLO. When Gorbachev came to power, that changed. The USSR slowly started to cut support for the PLO and pressured Arafat to recognize Israel and start negotiating. This all came to a head with the August Coup, which the PLO sympathized with. As a result, the USSR cut all support for the PLO, causing it to dissolve months later. The Madrid Conference, which restarted the ""peace , kicked off in October of 1991. That date is obviously not a coincidence. This process would culminate in the Oslo Accords in which the PLO recognized Israel and Israel recognized the PLO as Palestine's representative. The vast majority of Palestinians viewed this as a grand betrayal by the PLO, which quickly became a collaborationist organization (at least its leadership did). With the collapse of material and popular support for leftist-secular groups, a power vacuum developed. This vacuum would be filled by Hamas and other similar groups, which received material support from places like Qatar/Egypt. These groups lacked the stink of betrayal that now stuck to the collaborationist PLO. The left had lost its revolutionary drive (except for the PFLP). Israel did try to help this process along for ""divide and conquer"" reasons, but the reality is that the ascendancy of Hamas was part of a much larger historical process in Palestine and the rest of the Arab/Islamic world. So why does it matter if we reductively argue that ""Israel created Hamas?"" It matters because doing so means we're playing into the Zionist framing of Hamas as a terror organization detached from the legitimate will of the Palestinian people. It's NOT a Zionist creation. Hamas is just one organized faction within a larger coalition. The liberation of Palestine is at the core of its ideology, and its Islamism does not prevent it from working with Marxists and non-Muslims to achieve that central goal. The Zionist state wants us on the back foot trying to explain why we support ""evil Muslim terrorists"" because it distracts us from the core point that Israel is a genocidal apartheid state and an imperial outpost of the Anglo-American hegemon. Don't qualify your solidarity with the Palestinian struggle by wringing your hands over Hamas. Solidarity isn't about friendship or having the exact same beliefs.. it's about the recognition of our common struggle against exploitative and oppressive structures.""",,562,"{'like_count': 290, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 118713}",Hampton Institute,,2023-10-12 17:27:32,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/348258081_711050220707798_8654970863773687644_n.jpg?stp=c0.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=8NUIQ3udXS4AX8r9hKw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDq0XkJRCt56Xy5h2jH3w7THzP61DCRF620HpvjO1DDVg&oe=655AD0A6,https://www.facebook.com/100066604386717/posts/668049395425201,

facebook,"Quote from the audio series, ""Spiritual Conflict, Vol 4, Pt 1: God's Word‚ÄîThe Spirit's Sword."" There will come a time in the experience of every person called to serve God and called to the ministry where you‚Äôll have to sit alone. You cannot go with the crowd, you cannot enjoy the things the crowd enjoys, you cannot laugh at their foolish jokes, you cannot enjoy their lightness because the Word of God is something sacred and solemn. Personally, I went through this in the British Army. That‚Äôs why these verses are so particularly real to me. For years I sat alone. I was literally the only believer in the entire company. I could not go to the places they went to, I could not read the things they read, I couldn‚Äôt listen to the things they listened, I couldn‚Äôt talk the way they talked; I was isolated. Why? Because God had laid His hand on me. And there will always come, in every life that‚Äôs called into the ministry, the testing of loneliness. Maybe you‚Äôll be the only person in your family that believes. No one else will understand you. You have to sit alone. Not permanently.

facebook,"Narcissists, characterised by their extreme self-centeredness and lack of empathy, possess a manipulative storytelling tendency that often vilifies those they have wronged. By strategically crafting narratives that depict their victims as the instigators of conflict or as morally flawed individuals, narcissists cunningly avoid facing the consequences of their own harmful actions. This intriguing behavioural pattern demonstrates their steadfast commitment to preserving their self-image and shielding themselves from any accountability. When confronted with their destructive behaviour, narcissists quickly resort to distorting the truth by transforming themselves into the innocent party and painting their victims as villains. With carefully chosen words and skilful manipulation, they effectively shift the blame onto others, safeguarding their self-perceived moral superiority. They skillfully use emotional manipulation techniques to undermine the credibility of those who dare to challenge their actions, leaving them in a situation where their voice is silenced, and their character is assassinated. Unfortunately, this deceptive storytelling has severe consequences for the victims of narcissists. Their reputation becomes tarnished, their grievances invalidated, and their pain dismissed. The narcissist, expertly manipulating the narrative, creates an alternate reality where their actions are justified, and their victims are undeserving of sympathy or understanding. This perpetuates a cycle of emotional abuse, as the victim becomes further marginalised and isolated from supportive networks due to the fabricated tales spun by the narcissist. It is essential to recognise the manipulative tactics employed by narcissists. By promoting awareness and education, we can help victims regain control over their own stories and expose the narcissist's attempts at self-preservation. It is through knowledge and solidarity that the truth can triumph over the distorted tales woven by narcissistic individuals.

facebook,"Do you teach students how to solve conflicts in a healthy way? It's such an important skill that will benefit them throughout their lives. As they are learning and developing this skill, it can be helpful to teach kids the ""3 C's"" of conflict resolution: Calm down, Communicate, and Choose a solution. üß† Calm Down: Conflict with others can bring up some intense emotions. When this happens, it's hard to think clearly or make good choices. That's why the first step is to calm down. Taking a break, doing some deep breathing, or talking to someone can help kids (and adults) feel more calm so they are ready to handle the issue at hand. üí¨ Communicate: This is the part of conflict resolution where the two parties calmly talk about the problem. Each person can share their perspective and listen to what the other person has to say. This is also a great time to apologize if needed. üí° Choose A Solution: Once everyone has had a chance to share their perspective, and to listen to others, it's time to figure out how to solve the problem. The solution will depend on the problem, but some examples include taking turns, finding a compromise, or sharing. I'd love to hear your favorite ways to teach about conflict resolution, so let me know!",,478,"{'like_count': 201, 'comment_count': 13, 'num_users': 35644}",Counselor Chelsey,,2023-10-12 01:31:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/158879130_167085538561534_5632522960192988387_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=8r-dhFqYDfsAX-0Sxby&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD4DjUyDEvDMwWSHXEgv2Q7Cb53GK6ePazCdbnYYEIsXA&oe=657D254A,https://www.facebook.com/100057802670655/posts/748937710376311,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/380999671_738753348061414_1584489002839501608_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NIh2D13Qu4MAX8xkLdB&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAJ5Zq9Sn1atI8QhISaJEdIh5TK01txaXcsfTiWZjWTvA&oe=65368B8D

facebook,"#FootballEducation ~Comments I wish to opine on a matter that has been bothering me for a while. After the letter from a particular club owner, calling for the chairman of the PSL, Dr. Irvin Khoza, to step down was leaked to the media - a lot of people are sharing the letter in agreement that the ""Iron Duke"" must vacate his post. The PSL has a board of directors, and this board re-elected Dr. Irvin Khoza unopposed. Under the stewardship of Dr. Khoza, the PSL is one of the richest leagues in Africa, if not the richest. Yes, the PSL has it's challenges, but so does the EPL, La Liga, Serie A, etc. The fact of the matter is: under the leadership of Dr. Irvin Khoza the PSL is solid, stable and successful. People say a lot about the conflict of interest wherein Dr. Irvin Khoza is simultaneously the chairman of the League and the chairman of a club that participates in the same League. But the conflict of interest they are talking about is merely perceived, and not material. None of Dr. Irvin Khoza's detractors can come forward with an allegation that is solid. None of them can even submit a substantial allegation that Orlando Pirates have in any way, shape or form benefitted from having their chairman occupy the highest seat in South Africa's professional football. Every football lover in South Africa ought to be appreciative and give respect to the ""Iron Duke"" for his immense contribution to building a football League the PSL into what it is today. The people who are calling for Dr. Khoza to step down will not be able to even do half the job that he has done if given the opportunity. As an upcoming coach who aspires to coach in the PSL one day, I choose to express my recognition and respect for Dr. Khoza and his massive contribution to South African football.

facebook,"Hey, Hivemind -- Do you know how much I like and appreciate you? I hope you do. This group is amazing: people from diverse backgrounds, homeschooling for dozens of different reasons, holding different views in politics, religion, and worldviews come together every day to discuss homeschooling topics in a reasoned, civil, decent way. I rarely have to chide anyone for ad hominem attacks. I rarely find cause to delete anything. It's a little bumpy now and again, but for the most part, you guys are the cat's pajamas, and I love you for it. Years ago, on my local, secular homeschool group, a dad joined and started posting these wild religious posts.* I asked him to stop and said he was plenty welcome to post, ""I wrote this [short description of content], if you're interested, it's [url] over here."" He came back spittin' mad and asked who I thought I was. I responded that I was, in fact, the group owner, that he'd agreed to the group rules when he joined, and that he didn't have to stay if he didn't want to follow them. Over my shoulder Kidlet quipped, ""And I have a pink hoodie!"" Thus was born the family joke that a pink hoodie is a symbol of great power. I take that power very seriously: and I loathe having to use it. I joined this organization *because* it supports homeschooling in WA. All homeschoolers in WA. That's part of what makes WHO unique and amazing. To be frank, I did not anticipate the coordinated onslaught from from the Banned Books Week post -- I really just love discussing literature: it was one of my most favourite parts of homeschooling. Until yesterday, in 13 years I had banned five people from this list -- that's how important I think that WHO is to homeschoolers. I hate to do it, and I never do it lightly. Five people in over a decade. Yesterday, I banned-and-deleted 314. These people are not homeschoolers, are not part of our community, and do not want to do anything other than create conflict. They were largely from Texas, Florida***, Missouri, and Iowa, and, as you saw if you were following that thread, were acting in concert from the playbook of a religious political organization**, with a cherry overlay of name calling. (I've been called an ""unfit parent"" before for unschooling and allowing my kidlet more freedom than other people are comfortable with, but this is the first time I've been called a pedophile, groomer, or predator (well, technically, I was called a ""predater"" but I'm going to say that I'm pretty sure (at least in context) this was meant to be ""predator."" As you might imagine, the offlist messages were worse, and I had a few cyber security people tell me to expect death threats). Please let me know if someone you know was wrongly deleted. At some point late last night, I stopped bothering to look at the posters' info to make sure they weren't from here. I may have caught a few legitimate WA homeschoolers in that dragnet, and like I said: I am loathe to prevent any homeschoolers from accessing this resource. But I'm also not going to let this page devolve into some troll sandbox to play in. Warmly, ~Jen *Amongst other things, he had grand plans to bring Islam, the LDS, and Judaism together to form a single religion. (I try not to judge, but I don't think my characterization here is unwarranted). **Edited to add: I know this because my family was part of that organization when I was growing up. I do not know if the folks yesterday were religious, just noting which playbook they were using. ***Edited to add: WHO has followers who lived here and left (including one board member who headed for a sunnier clime), who live elsewhere and find us through friends, etc. I don't know if the folks who piled on yesterday were religious or not, what their politics were, or even if they were people and not bots.

facebook,"COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS 

When upon life‚Äôs billows
You are tempest tossed,
When you are discouraged,
Thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Refrain:
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one,
Count your blessings,
See what God hath done!
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Are you ever burdened
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will keep singing
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings.
Wealth can never buy
Your reward in Heaven,
Nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict
Whether great or small,
Do not be disheartened,
God is over all;
Count your many blessings,
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you
To your journey‚Äôs end.

(John¬≠son Oat¬≠man, Jr., 1897)

facebook,"We, members of the undersigned human rights organizations in Israel, are shocked and horrified in these dreadful days. Hamas‚Äô horrific crimes against innocent civilians - including children, women, and the elderly - have shaken us all, and we are struggling to recover from the unbearable sights and sounds. Some of us were in the Israeli communities on the Gaza border during the assault; many of us have family, friends, and colleagues who endured and are still in the midst of the harrowing events; and we all know people who were murdered, injured, or abducted. It will take time to fully understand the implications and consequences of Hamas‚Äô heinous attack, for which there can be no justification. Most of our teams include Israelis and Palestinians; therefore, some of us have relatives and colleagues in Gaza currently living under the ongoing assault of the Israeli military. Children, women, and the elderly are being indiscriminately attacked with nowhere to hide. Even now ‚Äì especially now ‚Äì we must maintain our moral and humane position and refuse to give in to despair or the urge for vengeance. Keeping our faith in the human spirit and its inherent goodness is more vital than ever. One thing is clear: We will never surrender our belief in humanity - even now, when doing so is more challenging than ever. Having always opposed the harming of innocent civilians, it remains our duty in these terrible times - as we count our dead on the Israeli side and worry about wounded, missing, and abducted loved ones, and as bombs are being dropped on residential neighborhoods in Gaza, wiping out entire families with no possibility of burying the dead ‚Äì to raise our voices loud and clear against the harming of all innocent civilians, both in Israel and Gaza. We call for the immediate release of all hostages and an end to the bombardment of civilians in Israel and in Gaza. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to reach civilian populations, medical facilities and places of refuge must not be harmed, and vital resources such as water and electricity must not be cut off. The killing of additional civilians will not bring back those who were lost. Indiscriminate destruction and a siege harming innocents will not bring relief, justice, or calm. As individuals working to promote human rights and who believe in the sanctity of life, we urgently call for an end to all indiscriminate harming of civilian lives and infrastructure. We call for negotiations and all possible action to be taken to bring about the release of the hostages - while prioritizing the civilians held by Hamas. It is the only humane and rational thing to do, and it must be done now.

facebook,"There are no excuses for the horrendous killings and acts committed by Hamas attackers against Israeli civilians at a festival this weekend, nor for the decades-long subjugation and occupation of Palestinians and their lands by Israeli forces. Yet to resolve issues facing us today, we must understand the path that led to this moment. Addressing ‚Äúwhere do we go from here?‚Äù first requires answering ‚Äúhow did we get here?‚Äù In supporting liberation for all oppressed peoples, including our Palestinian and Jewish relatives, we look to history to teach us of the right steps forward. In treaty negotiations with the U.S. government, it is told that Sitting Bull said ‚Äúlet us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our children.‚Äù We heed Sitting Bull‚Äôs wisdom as we pray for healing and an end to violence in Palestine/Israel. Indigenous Peoples intimately understand the broader dynamics in play here. On one hand, we have militarized and nationalistic settler-colonial rule over a subjugated and long-disregarded people. On the other, the settler-colonial enterprise of the Israeli state is itself a product of the deceitful and manipulative dealings of greedy Western powers, then and now. Paradoxically, Israel is a creation of European-Christian imperialism and supremacy, forces that abused Jews for centuries. The majority of the world‚Äôs ‚ÄúZionists‚Äù are actually evangelical Christians who not only regard Jews as antithetical to their worldview of Christ‚Äôs return, but who also are motivated by deep-seated Islamophobia and Arabophobia. During the Holocaust, the countries of Europe and the United States turned away hundreds of thousands of Jews seeking refuge from Nazi gas chambers and firing squads. Many of those Jews were returned to the Nazi death camps for slaughter, and the lucky ones were deported to Palestine (often against their wishes) to prop up an emerging nation-state integral to the geopolitical interests of European powers and the U.S. Without the conniving and calculated efforts of Europe to ‚Äúdivide and conquer‚Äù the Middle East for long-term strategic military and financial gain, the Israeli state would likely not exist. Without the selfish interests of the U.S.‚Äôs sprawling military and fossil fuel industrial complex, Israel would not be able to maintain its settler-colonial rule over Palestine. The old ‚Äúcrabs in a bucket‚Äù analogy is apt here: faced with a conflict between their own survival and the humanity of their Palestinian neighbors, Israel‚Äôs founders chose the former. Driven by white supremacy and racial hierarchy, Western powers were quick to side with the Jews they sought to remove from their own countries over the ‚Äúdesert dwelling‚Äù Arab populations of the Middle East. The early Zionist leaders of the Israeli state embraced these despicable notions in furtherance of their own survival and statehood. Ironically, while prior to 1948, ‚ÄúPalestinian‚Äù included Jewish inhabitants of the Holy Land, who lived, worked, and loved alongside their Arab Muslim and Christian neighbors, Israel‚Äôs founding ruptured that communal solidarity and replaced it with a regime that placed Jews atop all others. None of this diminishes the historic and spiritual Judaic connection to the Land of Israel. Jews have maintained a physical presence in the Holy Land, without interruption, since the destruction of Jerusalem‚Äôs second Holy Temple and their expulsion in 70 C.E. Prior to that, even in periodic times of absence, Jews maintained ties to the Holy Land for nearly 4,000 years. Their language, laws, culture, and ritual practice are all rooted in that land. At the same time, Jews have been compelled over the last 2,000 years to embrace diasporic lifeways. Christian hegemony forced Jews into second-class citizenship, at best. Centuries of pogroms and legalized discrimination across Europe ‚Äî often mandated by the Church ‚Äî kept Jews in a constant position of fear, trauma, and isolation. In just a few years, the Holocaust killed half of the world‚Äôs Jews. Yet it is crucial to highlight that Judaism and Zionism are distinct concepts; many of the world‚Äôs Jews oppose or don‚Äôt consider the Israeli state part of their religious-ethnic outlook. Many Jews consciously chose not to immigrate to Palestine in the 1940s. Others immigrated out of lack of choice. And certainly, many immigrated out of zealous yearning. Nor does the above context negate the ongoing responsibility of the Israeli state to take accountability for its repression and cruelty towards Palestinians. The Holocaust and millennia of antisemitism are no justification for brutal occupation and colonial rule over millions of people. The past victimhood of Jews is improperly weaponized by Israel‚Äôs government and Zionist ideologues to justify victimizing Palestinians. Today‚Äôs Israeli leadership is unmistakably neo-fascist in its repression not just of the Palestinian People, but in its repression of free speech and acceptance of authoritarian governance.

facebook,"Over 1200 brutally murdererd, In ways that never appeared in the worst horror films Thousands of wounded Around 150 kidnapped to Gazza, including babies, children, women and the elderly Endless rockets fired at Israel and stil being fired Hundreds of the dead, some of them my friends, lost their life in a psytrance party by the amazing NOVA crew. I played in a different party in the very same location, less than 24 hrs before this horrendous act, the mind boggles. I have been dealing with hundreds of messages in Instagram in the last few days, and the amount of upsetting ones is incredible. Most of them automatically answer with stats of dead palestinias, a simple 'free palestine', or with information about the middle east conflict, and that we get our karma back etc etc. People have lost their humanity and insist on avoiding the fact that Hammas delibiratley went out to murder babies, eldery women, to rape young girls and to kidnap an insane amout of people, with unknown fates but horrific ones for sure. Yes the conflict is long, and thousands of innocent civilians in Gazza have lost their lives in the past, and will do so in the next days too. But comparing the ruthless acts of Hammas to the israeli army and blaming Israel does not excuse you from acknowledging the horror that happened on october 7th, one of the most horrific terror acts in decades if not ever. I will spare you the details, the stories ive heard and the videos i have seen, the mind can't really process this awful information, but its beyond terror, beyond evil. We as Jews and Israelis have gone through these horrors countless times in history and will probably witness more in the future. But for now, we must focus on the horrors of the hostages in Gazza who are still alive.

facebook,"Gu»ôƒÉ: Israelul a ajuns √Æn situa»õie limitƒÉ din cauza Americii, devenitƒÉ un azil politic. RƒÉzboiul israelo-palestinian poate dinamita Europa occidentalƒÉ! (transcrierea editorialului vorbit din emisiunea ‚ÄúCe-i √Æn Gu»ôƒÉ, »ôi-n cƒÉpu»ôƒÉ!‚Äù, de la GOLD FM) Autor: Cozmin Gu»ôƒÉ Donald Trump a ini»õiat, √Æn ultimul sƒÉu an de mandat, un proces de pace durabilƒÉ √Æn Orientul Mijlociu. Probabil cƒÉ asta ar fi putut fi cea mai importantƒÉ realizare a sa. √ént√¢lniri de neconceput √Ænainte √Æntre liderii arabi »ôi cei israelieni au √Ænceput sƒÉ se desfƒÉ»ôoare drept consecin»õƒÉ √Æn ultimii ani. RƒÉzboaiele, crimele »ôi atentatele au diminuat serios √Æn zonƒÉ, spre 0, p√¢nƒÉ c√¢nd s-a ajuns √Æn marele impact actual. VƒÉ reamintesc cƒÉ, chiar acum vreo douƒÉ sƒÉptƒÉm√¢ni, se punea problema finalizƒÉrii acordului dintre Arabia SauditƒÉ »ôi Israel. Cum s-a ajuns, √ÆnsƒÉ, √Æn situa»õia la limitƒÉ de astƒÉzi? Biden »ôi SUA ar fi trebuit sƒÉ-»ôi concentreze toate eforturile diplomatice pentru consolidarea procesului de pace durabilƒÉ √Æn Orientul Mijlociu, ini»õiat de cƒÉtre Trump, de cƒÉtre America; era oricum conflictul ce poate pune pe butuci lini»ôtea planetei. Acest lucru se vede limpede azi. √én loc de asta, obsedat de √Ængroparea dosarelor sale de mare corup»õie din Ucraina, plus escamotarea tuturor laboratoarelor ilegale de acolo, cu poten»õial de arme chimice, Biden »ôi ai lui au for»õat declan»ôarea rƒÉzboiului din Ucraina, unde, dupƒÉ cum a»õi vƒÉzut, Ucraina joacƒÉ doar rolul de proxy. Procesul de negocieri pentru pace durabilƒÉ √Æntre Israel »ôi statele arabe a fost abandonat √Æn mandatul lui Biden. Ba mai mult, dupƒÉ rec√¢»ôtigarea alegerilor de cƒÉtre Netanyahu, americanii, chiar ei, au amorsat proteste de stradƒÉ √Æn Israel ce n-au putut fi oprite dec√¢t zilele trecute, prin atacul terorist al Hamas de s√¢mbƒÉta trecutƒÉ. Aceasta e principala cauzƒÉ pentru care azi stƒÉm cu sufletul la gurƒÉ de teama unui s√¢ngeros rƒÉzboi israelian, ce se a»ôazƒÉ, prieteni, pe modelul lugubru al celui ucrainean. Nu vede»õi cƒÉ nimeni nu-»ôi pune problema milioanelor de mor»õi arabi, dar »ôi israelieni? Cum trƒÉiesc oare civilii din Israel »ôi statele arabe din regiune √Æn ultimele zile? Cu frica mor»õii iminente, vƒÉ spun eu. Ba mai mult, cum crede»õi cƒÉ se simt cetƒÉ»õenii occidentali din Marea Britanie, din Fran»õa, Belgia, Olanda, Germania etc., »ôtiind cƒÉ √Æn orice moment milioanele de refugia»õi musulmani de acolo, din »õƒÉrile lor, se pot rƒÉscula »ôi pot trece la violen»õe din spirit de solidaritate cu fra»õii lor palestinieni? Din pƒÉcate, Biden »ôi ai sƒÉi nu se g√¢ndesc la asta, a»ôa cum nu s-au g√¢ndit nici la bie»õii ucraineni √Æn ultimul an »ôi jumƒÉtate sau la faptul cƒÉ economiile »õƒÉrilor din Uniunea EuropeanƒÉ au fost puse pe butuci, la pachet cu via»õa noastrƒÉ, a europenilor. Am vorbit √Æn titlu despre America ce a devenit un azil politic cu avatarurile consecutive acestei stƒÉri de fapt. O sƒÉ argumentez, cit√¢nd textul lui Alin Fumurescu, din Dilema Veche. Fumurescu este un clujean, ce trƒÉie»ôte de peste 20 de ani √Æn SUA, astƒÉzi este profesor la Universitatea din Houston. Citez: ‚ÄûProblema e cƒÉ frustrarea »ôi deziluzia la care fƒÉcea referire Biden s√Ænt cauzate ‚Äì »ôi nu √Æn micƒÉ mƒÉsurƒÉ ‚Äì »ôi de √ÆncƒÉpƒÉ»õ√Ænarea sa de a candida pentru al doilea mandat, la venerabila v√ÆrstƒÉ de 81 de ani. Asta √ÆnseamnƒÉ cƒÉ, dacƒÉ va fi reales, √Æ»ôi va √Æncepe mandatul la 82 »ôi »ôi-l va sf√Ær»ôi la 86. Iar omul se mi»ôcƒÉ »ôi vorbe»ôte deja ca √Æntr-un film dat cu √Æncetinitorul. √én treacƒÉt fie vorba, chit cƒÉ, obiectiv vorbind, e mult mai energic, la cei 77 de ani»ôori ai sƒÉi, nici Donald Trump nu mai e chiar un adolescent acneic (de»ôi se comportƒÉ ca unul). Senza»õia e una de ‚Äôd√©j√†-vu‚Äô. Din nefericire, aceste cazuri nu mai reprezintƒÉ excep»õii, ci, mai degrabƒÉ, regula. Democrata Dianne Feinstein »ôi-a dat ob»ôtescul sf√Ær»ôit sƒÉptƒÉm√Æna trecutƒÉ la 90 de ani, direct de pe bƒÉncile Senatului, pozi»õie la care n-a vrut sƒÉ renun»õe p√ÆnƒÉ la ultima suflare ‚Äì fƒÉrƒÉ metafore. La nici 84 de ani»ôori, Nancy Pelosi a renun»õat la pozi»õia de lider al democra»õilor din Camera Reprezentan»õilor, dar s-a grƒÉbit sƒÉ-»ôi anun»õe inten»õia de-a candida pentru a douƒÉzecea oarƒÉ (!) la un fotoliu √Æn Congres. De partea cealaltƒÉ a spectrului politic, Mitch McConell, liderul senatorilor republicani, »ôi √Æn Senat de vreo patruzeci »ôi doi de ani (!), a avut repetate momente √Æn care, √Æntr-un limbaj stradal, ‚Äòi s-a rupt filmul‚Äô, dar n-are nici o inten»õie de-a se retrage. DupƒÉ cum se vede, politicienii americani, indiferent de culoarea politicƒÉ, sex sau religie, s√Ænt mai conservatori dec√Æt Papii, care au √Ænceput sƒÉ se retragƒÉ, de bunƒÉvoie »ôi nesili»õi de nimeni. Nu √Ænt√ÆmplƒÉtor, o altƒÉ aspirantƒÉ la fotoliul de la Casa AlbƒÉ, fosta guvernatoare a Carolinei de Sud »ôi fosta ambasadoare a SUA la ONU, Nikki Haley, a etichetat Senatul american ca fiind ‚Äöcel mai costisitor azil (nursing home) din America‚Äô‚Äù. E limpede, deci, prieteni, de unde vine sintagma de ‚ÄûAmerica ‚Äì un azil politic‚Äù, de unde vine declinul grav al Americii de astƒÉzi, o AmericƒÉ ce trebuie sƒÉ se trezeascƒÉ rapid, altfel ne bagƒÉ √Æntr-un conflict de amploare (truncated)",,396,"{'like_count': 300, 'comment_count': 31, 'num_users': 106602}",Cozmin Gusa,,2023-10-12 11:37:48,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/292566116_384763190310470_4569491754297603026_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=IZksMKZV3cYAX_rpT-N&_nc_oc=AQm2DAiAJsvye8-SdPHesFAbZOXSRCQo7mATETTaqyIdCRxbGGYW1TrCF19o371Efe8&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDMtf72eW8X_9jFJt6lNXI5-ZrOH44XQ4MoBvz0dIA1-g&oe=655B243A,https://www.facebook.com/100063303756078/posts/645609334225853,

facebook,"Message for 12th October ~*Amethyst Wings*~ ‚ú® The amethyst angel has appeared in your reading today to bless you and let you know that the turmoil you are currently experiencing is there to clear the way for a positive transformation. ‚ú® Amethyst is a crystal that helps transform and transmute the energies that no longer serve us. Your soul has yearned for this transformation and has ignited the flame. Your heart yearns for you to be happy and free you from inner turmoil and conflict. ‚ú® What is about to be released and transformed is anger and fear which have been secretly stored within the recesses of your heart, so well so, that you may hardly be aware that you have them. ‚ú® Transformation is in essence change which we instinctively resist. We often have no clear idea what change will bring. Part of us, especially the mind, feels secure in what is familiar and wants to hang on to things just the way they are. Meanwhile, our heart yearns for this transformation, for it desires greater freedom. Your spirit can see the bigger picture of your life and has sown the seeds of change. The message for you today is go with the flow. Struggle not ‚Äì allow the transformation.

facebook,"For the past few days I‚Äôve been quiet because I was so overwhelmed and worried about being misinterpreted. This morning I‚Äôm filled with a sadness for humanity- that I had to say something. For me this is not about picking a side in Israel/ Palestine. It‚Äôs that as I mourn for my extended family in Israel who I heard has been kidnapped and more civilians who were attacked. I also mourn for the millions of civilians in Gaza and Palestinian Territories, for my loved ones who have family there, for the mothers and fathers who are mourning their children, or who are without food, water, electricity. When we dehumanize a whole people on either side- then it gives permission to do anything and feel nothing. As a 2nd generation Immigrant- descendant of German Jews who escaped Nazi Germany and also descendant of Black South African family who escaped Apartheid South Africa. And as Black American born and raised in The Bay Area, I see this power struggle from so many different angles. And I know it‚Äôs not a fair fight. It‚Äôs painful from every direction right now and in my heart I just can‚Äôt be one sided about it. It‚Äôs never justifiable when children and mothers and civilian families are attacked period. It‚Äôs all of our responsibility to look into the long painful history of this conflict - including myself. It‚Äôs complex and I still don‚Äôt fully understand it. But I‚Äôm looking up the numbers feed to us by various media on both sides. I‚Äôm praying that civilians don‚Äôt continue to die on both sides. I absolutely do not have the answer. I just know it‚Äôs dangerous when you start looking at a whole people as not human. üíîüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ",,386,"{'like_count': 169, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 542104}",Goapele,,2023-10-12 19:05:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/378552283_836471477848004_44674177636458940_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=NVFf-a2VSaMAX_E70Hp&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCHr9UduwyFFhkPOMeU372eti1a-07z7GIqCwspzOyyow&oe=655B5B85,https://www.facebook.com/100044554771003/posts/851379293023889,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387074243_851378466357305_5156990359679495086_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=bpHG2d-PKnIAX9apmlX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAyIoJ1zzOnGEgeCXWO8MWnMlSYK46xcLO13CJ5LUY0QA&oe=655A1BDE

facebook,"Like everyone, over the last few days I've looked on in horror at the events in Gaza and Israel. Regardless of your political position, the murder of innocent civilians is gut wrenching and wrong, and the Greens condemn those horrific attacks on civilians, whether they are Israeli or Palestinian. The scale of the horror is exactly why I think it‚Äôs crucial we are honest and clear eyed about how to stop this violence. As long as the Israeli government and military continue their occupation of Palestine and brutal blockade of Gaza, this cycle of violence will continue. For 17 years now, the roughly 2.5 million Palestians in Gaza have lived under a brutal blockade enforced by the Israeli Government and military, denying Palestians crucial medicines, construction materials, food, and other essentials. Here‚Äôs what Conservative UK Prime Minister David Cameron said all the way back in 2010: ""Everybody knows that we are not going to sort out the problem of the Middle East peace process while there is, effectively, a giant open prison in Gaza."" 50% of Gaza‚Äôs population are children under the age of 15 and 97% of water in Gaza is undrinkable. The one power station in Gaza was bombed in 2014, and the Israeli government hasn‚Äôt allowed it to be repaired properly, so Palestians experience power cuts for about 11 hours everyday. It‚Äôs almost impossible to get in or out of Gaza - even if you need urgent medical care. Because the Israeli government has blocked many medical supplies into Gaza, if you are diagnosed with cancer or other serious illnesses, the only chance you have is if you get a special permit to leave Gaza. Israeli authorities regularly deny or seriously delay these applications, which has seen people die of cancer while waiting to be approved. Israel has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Gaza. In response to all this, in 2018/19 Palestinians organised a mass peaceful protest movement in Gaza that saw hundreds of thousands of people march on the border checkpoints that lock Palestinians in Gaza. 150 Palestinians were murdered by the Israeli military in response and 10,000 were injured - over 5000 of whom were shot. Many of those shot were deliberately shot in the knees and ankles, which often led to amputations. Unemployment in Gaza is at 46% and the entire population lives under constant drone surveillance and intermittent bombing by the Israeli military. Studies have found over half of Palestinian children have presented with serious trauma based mental illness as a result of the blockade and bombing. Some Palestinians interviewed in Gaza have been quite clear about not having much to lose, having lost all hope of living a good life. This week, the Israeli Defence Minister has announced that Israel is cutting off all food, electricity, medicine and water into Gaza, while describing Palestinians in Gaza as ‚Äúhuman animals‚Äù. As the Israeli bombing of Gaza escalates, thousands of injured Palestinian civilians, including children, are heading to hospitals without power or supplies. Not only is this an act of genocide, but this will only further accelerate the cycle of violence. It‚Äôs seriously alarming that this week western governments, including Australia, have refused to condemn the Israeli state‚Äôs acts of genocide, or made any moves to prevent Israel from only further escalating this conflict. If we want to achieve peace it would look like an end to the blockade and occupation. Ending the illegal settlements on Palestinian land. A huge, international backed aid and reconstruction program for Palestine, to give Palestinians a future and some hope. This sort of process would bring peace for Israelis and Palestinians, and create conditions for Palestinians and Israelis alike to go on and build a good life. More bombing, blockading and killing will only bring more violence and misery.",,373,"{'like_count': 153, 'comment_count': 72, 'num_users': 20017}","Max Chandler-Mather, Federal MP for Griffith",,2023-10-12 07:17:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/199214511_228863075763348_1750717440319684455_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=pt_2sXG50eEAX_0czLA&_nc_oc=AQmCeuNoxtI8LxREVGRfWZXzwKyZP4v1TMsCURyPEsH8ItKgzd0GW1-s-QeIRivUPyw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBwvUVe6fU7XFoAKtcICH2BsE3-M3eGpjs7pM7CuMt40w&oe=657D46F9,https://www.facebook.com/100059189722711/posts/846935773956072,

facebook,"ADULT SUNDAY SCHOOL LESSONS|JULY-DECEMBER, 2023. UNIT 4: Christian Discipleship LESSON 15: OCTOBER 15, 2023. TOPIC: THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP Memory Verse: Matthew 10:39 - He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it (KJV). Lesson Bible Text: Luke 9:57-62; Matthew 10:34-39; 16:21-27. INTRODUCING THE LESSON The ""cost of discipleship"" means what it will take one to become Jesus' disciple. Jesus taught that being His disciple comes at a cost. To be His disciple requires a clear and total commitment and will involve sacrifice, suffering and service. When Jesus started recruiting His disciples, many initially are willing to follow the Lord, but fail to count the cost. Upon realizing the great sacrifice necessary to follow Him, many are unwilling to pay the price. For anyone to embark on a project he or she must sit down to consider the cost of it. Likewise, we must consider the cost of following Jesus before we can follow Him. We must count the cost and be willing to pay the price in service to the Lord. When we commit our entire lives to Jesus as His disciples, we emulate the One who laid down His life on our behalf for our salvation. 1. BE WHOLLY DEVOTED TO CHRIST A. Noble Ambition - Luke 9:57-58 B. Divine Invitation - Luke 9:59-62. 2. LOVE GOD ABOVE ALL OTHERS A. Sword Of Peace - Matthew 10:34-36 B. Ultimate Love - Matthew 10:37-39. 3. DENY YOURSELF AND FOLLOW CHRIST A. Opposing Views - Matthew 16:21-23 B. Word Or Soul - Matthew 16:24-27. LESSON NUGGETS 1. BE WHOLLY DEVOTED TO CHRIST Luke 9:58-62 ‚úÖÔ∏è From here we can see three people approach Jesus to be His disciples. The first person says, ""I will follow you wherever you go."" But Jesus replied, ""Foxes have dens to live in, and birds have nests, but I, the Son of Man, have no home of my own, not even a place to lay my head."" Jesus made this man to know what is involved in following Him. As believers, following Jesus is not just simply saying that you want to follow. It requires commitment and sacrifice. We must stop deceiving people with the idea that there is no commitment or sacrifice required to follow Jesus. Jesus warned this man that following Him is not easy. Following Jesus to wherever He goes is the best path for our life but it is not comfortable or convenient. Our comfort does not come before following Jesus. ‚úÖÔ∏è Jesus said to the second person, ""Follow me."" The man answered Jesus, ""Lord, let me first go and bury my father."" The third person said to Jesus, ""Lord, I will follow You, but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at my house."" Jesus replied him, ""No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."" Jesus' response to His would-be followers shows that even the most basic ""needs"" must be sacrificed in order to follow Him. Being a Jesus-follower demands whole-heartedness and the willingness to sacrifice. This aspect of the lesson call each of us to examine our hearts and discern whether we have Jesus' values in view when we promise our devotion and service to Him. Jesus shows us that God wants all people to respond to His invitation ie to follow Him without looking back. 2. LOVE GOD ABOVE ALL OTHERS Matthew 10:34-39 ‚úÖÔ∏è The concept of conflict is evident throughout the Scripture, from prophecy in Genesis that the woman's seed would bruise the head of the Serpent (Genesis 3:15) until Revelation's description of the final defeat of evil (Revelation 20:7-15). Enduring peace will not be a reality until the new heavens and the new earth (Revelation 21:1 through 22:6). When Jesus says that He did not come to bring peace, but a sword, what He is saying is that a complete surrender of our lives to Him will oftentimes put us squarely in conflict with others--even those closest to us.

facebook,"Statement From Dr Kemi Olunloyo 10/12/23 on FAKE DNA TESTSüö®üë∂üèΩ I am offline on medical leave till December 2023. According to authorities and mainstream media houses, there has been no DNA test conducted in Nigeria on Mohbad's son Liam since his father died. Wunmi Aloba is using a ""protected"" burner account and paid influencers to prove some point to the gullible public. Many Nigerians have no idea you could actually pay a blogger or influencer to push a non existent story or a pathetic lie to make it go viral. As a professional blogger since 1999 and journalist 1994, I have never been part of this deceptive practice or I would be filthy rich by now instead of always crowdfunding my work. Wunmi Aloba is simply using the manipulative lies she pushed the day Mohbad died. Naira Marley the musician who knew her well posed some disturbing questions on what happened to his former label signee. One of them caught my attention and it was ""Who paid Instablog to say it was an ear infection?"" It was Wunmi Aloba the wife who acted as family spokesperson. It has not been confirmed or denied if she actually paid the blog to push that narrative. Gistlover on the other hand rakes in millions to push false narratives. I am done with the Mohbad case and gotten what I need out of it. I will be writing articles in global magazines on the fall of the Nigerian music industry including cultism, sex and drugs, failure to take an adult man to the hospital and the destruction of surveillance cameras at his residence. I'm not a purveyor of fake news nor am I a prophetess. I investigate and analyse events carefully. If I want to tease the news I will. I teased Davido having two babies this year way before his Anita drama started. I teased the Covid death of Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff. Don't EVER affiliate me with a lawless country who have no clue what authentic news is. All the influencers who tweeted that imaginary Wunmi's DNA result is out did not post the results. Don't allow yourself to be gullible and rubbished because of your poor mentality. Even Davido who posted an old hospital room picture of his wife's 2019 delivery then quickly deleted it is the one posting today that you should stop circulating old pics. The same Davido who should have said the same in August when photos of him carrying Ifeanyi circulated as Chioma welcoming another boy. Don't let these people play mind games with you. Wake up and smell the coffee. The Nigerian police must not leave any stone unturned in unraveling all events leading to Mohbad's death including investigating his wife Wunmi who he mentioned in a conversation accusing her of trying to kill him AND post his voice notes when he's gone. I have worked in journalism since 1994 close to 30 years. Ignorance of Nigerians does not excuse stupidity. While I'm taking time off please only follow police reports. I will be back by December. I work alone with no admins. My school @2222MediaSchool has 2 instructors. The world is full of enough conflict and I don't cover wars. Take care of yourself and each other.

facebook,"DON'T MARRY ANYONE WHO ASK FOR A BREAK IN A RELATIONSHIP Written by Counselor Adolofi Often at times you hear one partner telling the other to give them a break or space or distance because they are not happy with them. People set rules such as 'don't come to my house', 'don't call me', etc. What will happen when the tongue asks for a break from the teeth because of a bite? Only children act like that. Relationship is for the matured man and woman and not boys and girls. There is nothing like a break or space or distance in relationship, in fact it is one of the most difficult but intriguing jobs on earth. A work that has no vacation or mid-terms. Even when you are mad at your spouse, you are expected to value your union over the conflict. You are expected to get back home to your family after work, perform your duties, continue to love and respect your spouse. It is normal for you to stay quiet when the one you love hurts you. It simply means if your love wasn't enough, your words might not matter but that doesn't mean you should go on a break. You never leave them. Your stay means, we may fight but I am not ready to sacrifice the union we have. Many are those who are quick to ask for a break, so they can embark on a search for part-time lovers; and when they don't get what they want, they return to you. But when they succeed, they either ignore you, care less about you or lead you on. Such people are not those you can plan your future with. As far as there is sunshine, there is rain; plants need both to grow. For any relationship to grow stronger, conflict is necessary; it points out your differences, what you need to learn and what you need to work on to be able to become one. Those who run away from conflicts are the very people who are not ready to learn or work on themselves in order to be one with you. Planning your future with such a person is so dangerous, they will leave you in the middle of the road, they will fail you at the time you need them most, they will abandon you at the moment you need a friend to hold on. As human as we are, as wicked we are, as sinful as our nature is, our God does not leave us. The bible says in Hebrews 13:5 (NIV) ‚ÄúNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you"". All because of His love for us. It is therefore an error for one to neglect the spouse, or let them be alone because of issues they are confronted with. You are not soft or a fool if you decide to stay, it only means you have a beautiful heart. You know what your partner did to hurt you yet you forgive and stay with them. Your partner grows to love you and he or she is safe with you. To know someone truly loves you, it is in bad times and not in good times; a small fight or misunderstanding can show you how much your spouse feels about you. If you care to know, spouses check their phones for the calls of their partners more frequently when they have misunderstandings than the days when things are going well for them in the relationship. Singles ought to know, marriage is not cheap, it's not easy; it's expensive, it's hard work, it's facing challenges and overcoming them; it's not about looking for an easy route to escape. Marriage has no windows. If he or she is asking for a break, then you better quit the relationship before it leads to . In conclusion ""Stop being mean, bad-tempered, and angry. Quarreling, harsh words, and dislike of others should have no place in your lives. Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God has forgiven you because you belong to Christ"" - Ephesians 4:31-32 (TLB).

facebook,"Amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, a concerning message has surfaced from Hamas Commander Mahmoud al-Zahar, expressing his group's aspirations for global dominance. A video clip, lasting over a minute, featuring the senior Hamas official has gone viral on the internet. In the footage, he claims that Israel is just the initial target and that their goal is to expand their influence worldwide. This ominous warning comes as Israel has declared war on Hamas following a shocking attack that claimed the lives of hundreds of Israelis. Zahar stated in the video, ""Israel is only the first target. The entire planet will be under our rule."" He continued, ""The entire 510 million square kilometres of Planet Earth will be subject to a system devoid of injustice, oppression, and the kind of violence and crimes witnessed against Palestinians and Arabs in various Arab countries, including Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and others."" Shortly after the video emerged, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement reaffirming his commitment to the ongoing fight against Hamas, declaring that every member of the Palestinian group was a target. ""Hamas is equivalent to Daesh (the Islamic State group), and we will dismantle them just as the world did with Daesh,"" he stated during a brief televised address.

facebook,"One reason why God says PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM, is not because Jews like you or you like them, it is because they were the people that He covenanted with to birth the Messiah and He remains true to His promise. When they are wrong, [and they were many times in scripture and even in world politics today] He punishes them and allows them to be plundered, but He will never abandon them completely or allow them to be displaced again. You can take that to the bank! Another reason is because He knows that Jerusalem is the pulse of the earth. If there is trouble there, trouble brews everywhere. No conflicts are as emotive and as polarizing as the conflict between the sons of Isaac and the sons of Ishmael. It was so in scripture and it continues to play out today. It draws every nation in and everyone feels obligated to take a side. Even the Anti Christ will be keen to establish his authority in the temple at Jerusalem. Mark 13:14 - ""So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains"". Even when Jesus returns during the 2nd coming [not the rapture], He will land there. On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives that lies before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west. Zechariah 14:4 The headquarters of the millenial reign shall be in Jerusalem, not in Switzerland :-) Isaiah 2:2In the last days THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE OF LORD will be established as the chief of the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it. ...For the law will go forth from Zion, and the word of the LORD FROM JERUSALEM. I know you thought America, or Europe or maybe even Saudi Arabia [depending on your colonizer, your faith and your influence :-) ] is the pulse of the earth. It's not. It's Jerusalem and what happens there. Because of the trouble there now, there is expected to be and there are calls for reprisals against them and against Americans worldwide. The Hamas leader even called for this yesterday. This means attacks wherever there are Jews or Americans or nations that support them. You can only imagine what kind of chaos this can birth all over the world. Take your position and pray. Declare Psalms 91 over yourself and your household. Over our nation and other nations, over your loved ones in Israel and America and all over the world. Rebuke the spirit of war and of death that is ravaging both commoner Jews and Palestinians as their leaders fight. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem and all who are in it. Don't take sides, pray. Don't be caught up in the politics, pray. See the bigger picture and pray for the preservation of lives, salvation of souls and the immense mercy of God over everyone already affected and who will be affected. Pray. Don't grow calloused and indifferent about the suffering of innocent, men, women and children, no matter which side you think is telling the truth. You PRAY! _____________________________ We dwell in the secret place of the Most High, we abide under the shadow of the almighty. We say of You Lord, your are our refuge and our fortress, our God in you we trust. Therefore every blessing and every promise of Psalms 91 is established for us and all that concern us today and always, in Jesus's Name [Get out your Bible and declare those promises] Mumebarikiwa.",,299,"{'like_count': 198, 'comment_count': 44, 'num_users': 59078}",Judy Karanja,,2023-10-12 05:36:43,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/194592235_328978571927081_199630409641227844_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=EO80Gcra5BIAX9VcRAP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDc5T25PdR8sqeyzItCCQBFd5dCacH5ebcOiiG0JSrmvg&oe=657D164E,https://www.facebook.com/100044448218851/posts/863369008488032,

During the meeting, the President reaffirms the Administration's close monitoring of the conflict and coordination with the Israeli government for updates on the latest situation, in order to ensure the safety and welfare of all Filipinos living in the war-stricken country. He urges all concerned government agencies, particularly the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), to come up with strong repatriation plans and explore all evacuation strategies to assist affected Filipinos. The Chief Executive reassures those who will be repatriated of the government‚Äôs continuous assistance to address their immediate needs, which include financial, livelihood, scholarship and food assistance, among others. According to the DFA, there are around 30,500 Filipinos living in Israel. Of this number, 99% are working as caregivers. As of the latest information, there are currently four (4) Filipinos missing and two (2) confirmed deaths. The DFA has already raised Crisis Alerts Level 2 and 3 in Israel and the Gaza Strip.",,298,"{'like_count': 170, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 497545}",Radio Television Malaca√±ang - RTVM,,2023-10-12 10:51:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242752604_232099998957363_5867204315811603150_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=H-sJzshk9aEAX9oeqHg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD9N0UXvpstwApCCx2JuKCG5sbf7DennaJLSiFG3yzXpQ&oe=655A41C8,https://www.facebook.com/100064720927568/posts/741581954675829,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/389736275_694236199004492_8030392141057963727_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad6a45&_nc_ohc=PqjZrLAlB0gAX8st0iW&_nc_oc=AQmr7Efwz9Fo8VXPKWNbMwEZ2DlxHkjeNAhWtoEAVAXJZLTOJPAw30bMvYiF3ypdg9w&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfD-IemKJfoUEpMggADdpzMp_6TB0BX59xZmtWE8Jh3OEQ&oe=652BF47D

facebook,"On Saturday there will be a solar eclipse named ‚Äúring of fire.‚Äù It will be visible mostly in the Americas and I believe given that everything we are seeing in the world this is no coincidence. God speaks through signs and wonders and the bible says that in these we will see signs in the heavens and here on earth. (Acts 2:19) We need to keep praying for the war in Israel üáÆüá± because in my spirit I sense that this is going to be a different war and there in an ancient spirit behind this battle. The good news is that even if darkness keep covering the earth so is the light shining brighter and revival is sweeping entire regions. The gospel is being preached and thousands of people are coming to Jesus every day! Before the war hundreds of Jews were coming to the knowledge of Christ. The spirit of violence (Hamas) is going to attempt to terrorise people all over the world but as believers we need to trust in God and his promises. He made an eternal covenant with us and He is El shadday and our protector! No matter what happens in the days to come‚Ä¶the Lord will take care of His people and just remember that at the end of the day Jesus wins! I know many are deeply concerned about this conflict becoming bigger and many are talking about the likelihood of this turning into World War III. Fear and anxiety are not your friends in this critical time but the Holy Spirit. My advice to you is trust God and hear his voice. Go deeper and seek His face. Pray and make sure your house is in order. Live righteously and surrender every day to JESUS and walk in the power of the Holy Spirit. These are not days to be lukewarm or halfway there‚Ä¶.you need to walk in the power of His word! Wether we are at the beginning of a world war or the beginning of more shakings. Don‚Äôt allow fear to grip your heart but look up and trust Him for He is our redeemer and our shepherd. When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.

facebook,"So thankful to be here. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏è God has done an incredible work in our marriage. We are two years married in November and have endured extreme crisis, conflict and fighting for two solid years as well as bankruptcy, multiple health crises and surgeries, having to sell our home and move into an RV, the loss of my seven figure business (I was a New Age coach and not a believer when we met and God finally burned that business down and brought me back to Him. Praise Him!!!üôèüèª) and satanic attacks that included a 6-hour demonic posession that nearly killed me (before I was saved). 28 days after we married my husband broke his neck and was out of work for 18 months. 5 months later he was told he was dying. As his ninth traumatic brain injury, the psychological damage was enormous. He became paranoid, delusional, and suicidally depressed. At his lowest point he stayed in bed for an entire month. If we went 48 hours without a WWIII blowout it was a rarity. I can‚Äôt count the number of times we got ‚Äúthis close‚Äù to divorce, to the point where he went to the courthouse and got all the necessary papers. My husband suffered severe PTSD from an extremely traumatic childhood of every kind of horrific abuse. He is also an ex meth addict and six time ex felon (now believer, clean and sober and making an honest living). And I came into the relationship as a power hungry alpha female and single mom used to running the show. And a hard core New Ager deep in a darkness I had absolutely no idea about. And we both have been diagnosed as bipolar. In every possible way it was a recipe for disaster. üòÜ And disaster it was. For two solid years. And then I came to Christ earlier this year ‚Äî coming back home to my roots as a Christian and my family heritage of priests, pastors and missionaries ‚Äî and Satan ramped it up even more and battled against our marriage relentlessly. I poured myself into walking in God‚Äôs will and learning how to be a godly wife. No matter what I felt my husband was doing (and totally blind to what *I* was doing, of course üòâ). To respecting and honoring him at all times. To submitting to him even when I felt his leadership was so lacking. And to bringing him a gentle and quiet spirit no matter how much I felt justified in my anger, hurt, frustration, and disappointment. After months of surrender to God and submission to my husband and putting these things into practice even though on the outside nothing was changing, suddenly one day while I was driving, I felt an unmistakable shift in my marriage. And I knew it was God placing his hand of grace on us and in that moment I thought, ‚Äúthings are different. They‚Äôre going to be different now.‚Äù And they have been. For three months not a single upheaval. What would have been landmine after landmine was simply a slight ripple on otherwise calm, peaceful, harmonious waters. I kept thinking to myself ‚Äúit‚Äôs like we suddenly received a PhD in emotional intelligence and healthy communication, what happened??!‚Äù God‚Äôs grace happened, that‚Äôs what. In the past two months my husband has had major back surgery, then an emergency appendectomy, then was just recently diagnosed with shingles. On top of his 3x/week migraines. And we have weathered every one with peace and calm. He is wonderful, gentle, loving, strong, adoring, calm, forgiving. And I am learning softness, timing, grace, respect and patience. It is a MIRACLE, in every sense of the word. So. For those struggling, feeling hopeless, feeling like they just can‚Äôt take another minute of the suffering, I hope my story has brought you some hope. God‚Äôs almighty power and grace is SO amazing. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª‚úùÔ∏è",,283,"{'like_count': 98, 'comment_count': 54, 'num_users': 388866}",The Purposed Marriage,,2023-10-12 21:50:51,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/355695198_7409854265698108_5198767408259465988_n.jpg?stp=c13.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=mNgw15rmIDwAX_sIIyY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAPUfwfTcKrOghE6kVAuUYNFWSgMkwfDIddF2YYo5q62Q&oe=655AED87,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1777338735885027/permalink/3583861061899443,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387056782_10231797180217451_8395526884062502823_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=REE7bMlyXasAX_OJr5c&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDvEDs_JJCvRjJnESlzwDbngcdn6bBQTA1_k1aTK_OwyA&oe=6541C094

facebook,"Israel. ‚ù§Ô∏è üáÆüá± As a believer in Jesus, my life has been forever marked by decades of biblical study and visits to the land. The history, archeology, people, culture, food, politics and relationships have changed me. My heart aches for this land. I am not not blinded in dogmatic certainty that this modern state can do no wrong. But there is no moral equivalence between the Jewish state, her right to exist in the land promised by God 3500 years ago, and the current evil assaults to her people and sovereign national interests by an apocalyptic messianic death cult funded by Iran. We cannot understand the modern conflict without understanding the historic spiritual causes. This is NOT a fight over boundaries and Palestinian resistance to an ‚Äúoccupying force‚Äù. Israel‚Äôs History does not start in 1948. She has been given this land and called by God to be a blessing to the whole earth. And we will live to see this truth come to pass. At this moment God has prepared a table for her in the presence of her enemies (Psalm 23) and she will pass through this valley of the shadow of death fearing no evil. For His rod and staff - His strength and authority - comforts her. We agree that goodness and mercy will follower her all the days of her life. And she will dwell securely in the house of the Lord, forever. Remember, God protects His people and His Word does not return to Him void. And if you seek the destruction of the Jewish people you are fighting the Almighty. I fervently pray for Peace in the City of Peace. And there is no peace for one unless there is peace for all. The Arab people are precious to God as well. And millions of them are perpetually being used as fodder in the cannons AntiSemitic hatered spweded by international ‚Äúgovernments‚Äù and state sponsored terrorism. I for one reject the false divide foisted upon us. I am not for Israel and against Palestine. But we should be crystal clear that Hamas, Hezbollah and the Iranian Ayatollahs lurching the world towards total war in the hopes they can entice their Mahadi out of hiding are nothing short of demonic. They seek the total destruction of the Israeli state and the Jewish people. This cannot stand. If you are a believer in Jesus, it‚Äôs time to use your spiritual weapons of war that are mighty in God for the tearing down of strongholds that build themselves up against against the knowledge of God. Prayer is not well wishing. It is the active rejection of darkness that joins the mission of Jesus to destroy the works of the devil. #Israel #prayers #peace #justice",,278,"{'like_count': 105, 'comment_count': 49, 'num_users': 30830}",Adam W.

Let me be very clear: Palestinians have the right to defend themselves. Israel is an occupational military force. They have no right to claim victimhood when the oppressed people they are occupying fight back against their oppressors. The media has also been largely silent about the daily escalations in war crimes and other atrocities inflicted by Israel over the past several months. Let us be clear: this is not a surprising response given the hundreds killed and thousands displaced by Israeli settler violence this past summer.

facebook,"Addo-Carr, Gould set to meet over star‚Äôs Bulldogs future after controversial fortnight Fox League from Fox Sports Bulldogs superstar Josh Addo-Carr has reportedly been summoned to a meeting with general manager of football Phil Gould amid reports his playing future at the club is in doubt. That is according to The Sydney Morning Herald who reports the pair will meet on Friday to discuss their differences. The Herald reports the Bulldogs are frustrated with Addo-Carr after he was involved in two controversies in the last fortnight, while the representative winger feels the club hasn‚Äôt supported him enough through the incidents. Addo-Carr received a two-match suspension last ween for his involvement in a brawl at the Koori Knockout, costing him a Kangaroos jersey. However the 28-year-old is reportedly appealing the sanction. Then this week he shared a controversial post on social media, which he later apologised for. Addo-Carr compared the Middle East conflict to Indigenous land rights. Addo-Carr had posted a photo of Aboriginal and Palestinian flags next to each other with the caption ‚ÄúOne struggle, one fight‚Äù while the phrase ‚ÄúLand Back‚Äù was accompanied by two Arabic words. But via a statement, Addo-Carr later said the post was ‚Äúa mistake‚Äù. He apologised for ‚Äúany offence‚Äù he caused and said he ‚Äúfelt remorse‚Äù as soon as it was brought to his attention that he had got it wrong. Before the two controversies Addo-Carr‚Äôs future at the Bulldogs was reportedly already clouded. He is the club‚Äôs biggest name and arguably best player, who is contracted until the end of 2025. However reports claim that the club expects more from him as a senior player. Addo-Carr joined the Bulldogs in 2022 after five seasons ‚Äî and two premierships ‚Äî with the Storm. He had a disappointing first season in his new colours and as a result lost his spot in the New South Wales Origin side. But a statement month of performances for the Kangaroos in last year‚Äôs Rugby League World Cup ‚Äî and six tries in his first seven games this year ‚Äî helped him earn a recall. He was picked in the Kangaroos squad for the upcoming Pacific Championships but his suspension forced coach Mal Meninga to drop him from the side and bring in Penrith‚Äôs Dylan Edwards.

So, let‚Äôs pray and be a community of hope, unity, and support. üìñ And as we do this, let's remember Psalm 122:6-9 ""Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: 'May those who love you be secure. May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.' For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, 'Peace be within you.' For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your prosperity."" We hope you will share this post and encourage others to pray! #PrayForIsrael",,273,"{'like_count': 72, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 31262}",Sagebrush Church,,2023-10-12 21:00:25,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/327191824_1893994914293698_4021283720369725456_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=wC3KUeKP8UwAX-d_RmH&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCuQYgTZOTExcEUWIZAJgWSQ3SNZaAEO5kKgEpt-7ZEdw&oe=655A72CC,https://www.facebook.com/100064731997445/posts/708799157954478,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391757596_708798644621196_3206000126994865828_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=yUsvu1C6GBoAX-UDxTy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA_d7i9xaEYABicB10zo9JfOukoCAAvV-s-uLK2WMK5Ew&oe=6558F130

facebook,"Simply dismissing Hamas as a terrorist organization like the U.S and the West have done is a rather unbalanced and too-simplistic way of looking at the Middle East conflict. To be clear, the activities of Hamas meet all the definitions of terrorism. And their reckless and thought-less acts of violence against the Israelis even before legitimately gaining control of Gaza in the 2006 election, are almost always the immediate trigger for the perennial bombardment of that territory with its attendant human and material losses. But, Truth be told, keeping the Palestinians in a state of statelessness for over 7 decades is in itself, an act of war. THIS IS THE BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. No person with a working conscience should support this. And the unbridled arrogance of the Isrealis which has seen them build settlements in the disputed territory even while negotiation was still going on, is PARTLY responsible for the stunted progress the peace process has witnessed for decades. To be fair, the Palestinians themselves have not helped matters. Their leaders have rejected the two state solution before now. And Hamas violence is PARTLY responsible for what the region has become. You cannot have a group - Hamas - which has the Total Destruction of Israel as its raison d'etre (primary reason for its existence) and this same group enjoys overwhelming support from Palestinians (they won a landslide victory in 2006 Gaza Election, putting them in charge of the territory) and you wonder why the Jewish state is imposing extreme security measures around Gaza??? Is the Israelis supposed to fold their arms and watch Hamas achieve their aim of destroying them? How difficult can it be for Hamas to see that its extreme and I dare say, acts of terror against the Jewish Nation provides a near-perfect justification for any action taken by the Israelis against the over 2 million residents of Gaza. Apparently, destroying Israel is more important than improving the lives of their people within the territory they control. As I type, Israel has cut off food, water and electricity from Gaza. Their hospitals have become one hell of a grave-yard. Their major infrastructure has been destroyed by Israeli bombs. So what exactly has Hamas gained by provoking this current cycle of violence? To make matters worse, the moderate Palestinian group, FATAH which recognises Israel is seen by most Palestinians as SABOTEURS who have been compromised. The only sure way of resolving the situation would have been through A TWO STATE SOLUTION but the practical man in me does not see this happening in the foreseeable future going by the extreme and impossible positions held by both parties in the conflict coupled with the fact that almost all the so-called mediators have continued to allow their own prejudices and biases cloud their sense of fairness.",,262,"{'like_count': 125, 'comment_count': 113, 'num_users': 73825}",Charles Ogbu,,2023-10-12 12:07:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/382807251_10161342381389255_2001937742175695914_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tNdaLBfVGngAX8lKScz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCVfH22jIzG3qst1B4L6vDN8ZVLUvWDZjKKzi6j1Y5KKQ&oe=655A531B,https://www.facebook.com/charles.ogbu2/posts/10161380251104255,

facebook,"„ÄêENG DUB„ÄëKarmic Cause, Karmic Effect, and Hao Liao Ge | Why are Christians less and less free? #god Although humans have free will, they don't understand the truth and reality of the universe and life. Thus, their free will tends to act ignorantly, which is blind action. The inertia energy generated from the actions of free will is called ""karma"". When free will is constantly acting, karma is accumulated and karmic habits are formed. When karmic habits act back upon free will, it is also known as inertial force, or simply karmic force. We know that while free will is acting, it is influenced by karma. We refer to the function of karma as karmic cause, and the effect of joint actions of free will and karmic cause, as karmic effect. Karmic effects then become new karmic causes, continuing to participate in free will's actions and giving rising to new karmic effects. In this way, various and countless karmic causes and effects are generated in our minds. The law of causality will never go wrong. Human beings are like this, becoming less and less free under the influence of karma. Every individual has their own free will. For countless lifetimes, due to each of our thoughts, we have created countless karma, formed various karmic causes, and accumulated countless karmic habits. Towards other individuals or races, we have accumulated various karmic causes such as affection or aversion, jealousy or contempt, fear or anger. Towards various things, we have accumulated karmic habits such as attachment, desire, greed, and avarice. All the karmic habits accumulated in the past and present lives, whether positive, negative, or neutral, become the karmic causes for the next rebirth. After rebirth, the innate potential of the Four Quotients, as well as various talents and interests, personality and temperament, are all karmic effects resulting from the karmic causes accumulated from countless lifetimes. The karmic forces, karmic habits, karmic causes, and karmic effects of all living beings intertwine and influence each other, forming the course of human history. Free will, influenced by karmic forces, creates everything, like an artist. Karmic causes and effects grow cycle after cycle, arise and cease due to various conditions, inconceivably, giving rise to all phenomena in the world, like a dancer. The karmic habits of humans lead to pervasive suffering, giving rise to countless pains and suffering of change (happiness). Every individual goes through birth, aging, sickness, and death; every family faces joy and sorrow, separation and reunion; every career undergoes rise and fall, success and failure; every heart experiences happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy. The world is like a stage, where a complex and ever-changing drama is constantly unfolding at every moment. Mountains move, valleys change, sea transforms into fields. Youthful faces of the past are now adorned with gray hair. Emotions fluctuate between joy and sorrow, laughter and anger. Day and night rotate, winter and summer alternate. Cloudy or sunny, dark or bright, the weather is unpredictable, the sun and moon are chasing each other. Life is filled with cycles of wealth and poverty, gains and losses, rise and fall, without a fixed pattern. Relationships are changeable: yesterday's flattery may turn into today's conflict. Humans don't know whether there are immortals in the world. Some people may believe in the existence of immortals, but they don't know what kind of beings they are. In their imagination, immortals are beings that live eternally and freely. In reality, what people truly envy is not immortals, but inner freedom. #secondcoming #christ #christreturn #christianity #reincarnation #rebirth #resurrection #lightofwisdomchurch #lightofwisdom #bible #essenceofhappiness #truefreedom #sefferings Regardless of religion or denomination, as long as you believe in Christ, believe in God, believe in reincarnation, turn away from evil and do good, repent and reform, we are brothers and sisters, and our denominations share the same vision.

facebook,"Statement From Dr Kemi Olunloyo 10/12/23 on FAKE DNA TESTSüö®üë∂üèΩ I am offline on medical leave till December 2023. According to authorities and mainstream media houses, there has been no DNA test conducted in Nigeria on Mohbad's son Liam since his father died. Wunmi Aloba is using a ""protected"" burner account and paid influencers to prove some point to the gullible public. Many Nigerians have no idea you could actually pay a blogger or influencer to push a non existent story or a pathetic lie to make it go viral. As a professional blogger since 1999 and journalist 1994, I have never been part of this deceptive practice or I would be filthy rich by now instead of always crowdfunding my work. Wunmi Aloba is simply using the manipulative lies she pushed the day Mohbad died. Naira Marley the musician who knew her well posed some disturbing questions on what happened to his former label signee. One of them caught my attention and it was ""Who paid Instablog to say it was an ear infection?"" It was Wunmi Aloba the wife who acted as family spokesperson. It has not been confirmed or denied if she actually paid the blog to push that narrative. Gistlover on the other hand rakes in millions to push false narratives. I am done with the Mohbad case and gotten what I need out of it. I will be writing articles in global magazines on the fall of the Nigerian music industry including cultism, sex and drugs, failure to take an adult man to the hospital and the destruction of surveillance cameras at his residence. I'm not a purveyor of fake news nor am I a prophetess. I investigate and analyse events carefully. If I want to tease the news I will. I teased Davido having two babies this year way before his Anita drama started. I teased the Covid death of Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff. Don't EVER affiliate me with a lawless country who have no clue what authentic news is. All the influencers who tweeted that imaginary Wunmi's DNA result is out did not post the results. Don't allow yourself to be gullible and rubbished because of your poor mentality. Even Davido who posted an old hospital room picture of his wife's 2019 delivery then quickly deleted it is the one posting today that you should stop circulating old pics. The same Davido who should have said the same in August when photos of him carrying Ifeanyi circulated as Chioma welcoming another boy. Don't let these people play mind games with you. Wake up and smell the coffee. The Nigerian police must not leave any stone unturned in unraveling all events leading to Mohbad's death including investigating his wife Wunmi who he mentioned in a conversation accusing her of trying to kill him AND post his voice notes when he's gone. I have worked in journalism since 1994 close to 30 years. Ignorance of Nigerians does not excuse stupidity. While I'm taking time off please only follow police reports. I will be back by December. I work alone with no admins. My school @2222MediaSchool has 2 instructors. The world is full of enough conflict and I don't cover wars. Take care of yourself and each other.

facebook,"Nuova scuola! E‚Äô iniziato il lavoro sul campo per l'apertura di una Scuola di Emergenza e Riabilitazione per bambini vulnerabili e sfollati ad Aden in Yemen, con lo stesso modello delle scuole Still I Rise nella RDC e nel N-O Siria. Perch√© lo Yemen? Qui la crisi dell'educazione √® critica. Circa 2,7 milioni di bambini non hanno accesso all'istruzione e devono affrontare violenze, abusi, lavoro minorile e un quotidiano reclutamento nei gruppi armati. Dal 2014 infatti lo Yemen √® teatro di un conflitto tra i ribelli Houthi e il governo riconosciuto a livello internazionale. A pagare il prezzo della guerra sono infrastrutture vitali come scuole e ospedali che sono state in gran parte distrutte. Le rivalit√† geopolitiche e gli interessi dei Paesi vicini hanno ulteriormente infiammato la situazione. Si stima siano 377.000 le persone morte a causa del conflitto e che pi√π della met√† siano morte a causa di fattori connessi al conflitto come la carestia e l'accesso limitato alle cure mediche. Al 2022 16,2 milioni di persone, pi√π della met√† della popolazione, non aveva da mangiare e circa 4,3 milioni di yemeniti sono stati sfollati. L'economia del Paese √® in rovina, con case, fattorie e infrastrutture civili cruciali distrutte. La distribuzione dei generi alimentari, in larga misura importati, √® compromessa e danneggiata dalle fazioni in guerra. I prezzi sono saliti alle stelle e molti cittadini tra i pi√π poveri hanno perso ogni fonte di reddito. L'attuale crisi umanitaria in Yemen ha notevolmente esposto bambini e donne allo sfruttamento, alla violenza e all'abuso, al lavoro minorile, alle uccisioni e alle menomazioni, al reclutamento dei bambini come soldati da parte delle fazioni in conflitto. La guerra e la crisi economica hanno compromesso l'accesso della popolazione alle strutture sanitarie. Oltre l'80% della popolazione yemenita fatica a disporre di acqua potabile e di servizi sanitari adeguati. Dopo oltre 9 anni, lo Yemen rimane un Paese con una crisi umanitaria tra le peggiori al mondo. Ecco perch√© abbiamo scelto di aprire qui la nostra scuola! Continua a seguirci per ulteriori aggiornamenti! ***** New school! Operations on the ground have started to open an Academy School for vulnerable and displaced children in Aden, on the same model as Still I Rise Schools in DRC and North-West Syria. Why Yemen? In Yemen, the education crisis is dire. Approximately 2.7 million children lack access to education, facing violence, abuse, child labor, and recruitment into armed groups. Since 2014, Yemen has experienced a conflict between Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized government. Amidst this turmoil, vital infrastructure, like schools and hospitals, were destroyed. Geopolitical rivalries and proxy interests have further inflamed the situation. The number of people who died due to the conflict is estimated to be 377,000, with over half of these fatalities occurring indirectly due to factors like famine and restricted healthcare access. By the year 2022, a staggering count of 16.2 million individuals‚Äîsurpassing half of the entire population‚Äîwere grappling with acute food scarcity. Alongside this, approximately 4.3 million Yemenis have been forced to relocate within the country's borders due to the ongoing crisis. The country's economy is in ruins, with homes, farms, and crucial civilian infrastructure destroyed. The flow of food, heavily reliant on imports, is severely disrupted by the warring factions. Prices are soaring, and many of the poorest have lost their income. The current humanitarian crisis in Yemen has increased the vulnerability of children and women to exploitation, violence and abuse, child labour, killing and maiming, recruitment and use of children by parties to the conflict as combatants. In addition to this, conflict and economic deterioration have compromised people‚Äôs access to health facilities. More than 80% of Yemen‚Äôs population struggles to have safe drinking water and adequate health services. After more than 9 years, Yemen remains one of the the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crises. That is why we choose to open our school here!

facebook,"EIGHT (8) FORMER REBELS RETURN TO THE FOLDS OF LAW Camp Olivas, City of San Fernando, Pampanga - In a momentous step toward enduring peace and reconciliation, eight (8) former rebels, who had been embroiled in armed conflict with the government, have voluntarily surrendered. This surrender represents a turning point in the continuous efforts to put an end to the prolonged conflict that has afflicted the region for years. These former insurgents chose to lay down their arms and turn themselves over to authorities in Bataan, Olongapo, Tarlac, and Pampanga. Notably, among them were former members of the Communist Terrorist Group (CTG) associated with Anakpawis Bulacan Chapter, Gabriela, Bagong Hukbong Bayan and UGMO (Underground Mass Organization). This event serves as a testament to the effectiveness of the government's reconciliation programs, which have been in place for years. These programs have been dedicated to offering former combatants alternative opportunities for a brighter future and a successful reintegration into society. The government has firmly committed to supporting the rehabilitation and reintegration of these former rebels into society, ensuring they have access to education, job training, and various essential services. PRO3 Regional Director PBGEN JOSE S HIDALGO JR said that while the path to lasting peace is a work in progress, there is no doubt that the decision of these former rebels to withdraw their support from their previous groups is a significant milestone in the ongoing journey toward stability and prosperity for the people. #SerbisyongNagkakaisa #ToServeandProtect #PRO3PartnerNgPamayanan",,241,"{'like_count': 163, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 181525}",Police Regional Office 3,,2023-10-12 12:56:05,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352308701_634022935269787_4800501893130010156_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=lZgXLi89KGEAX-3dD4q&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBTi6wQSuSDpUuRcoPpjZiEcfsoZnnVR_CgoIy-XMifhg&oe=6559C17A,https://www.facebook.com/100064537734995/posts/723359063158678,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391655880_723358396492078_3488694095676172098_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=OmXja194VJAAX_Ml3wI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBuqpxullUcb93-erEBuz3bfp83M3fuFysk95uFwc9W_g&oe=655A43B5

facebook,"MAAN Workers Association stands with the Israeli protest movement: ‚Ä¢ for ousting Hamas in Gaza ‚Ä¢ for replacing the Netanyahu government with a democratic regime. On Saturday, October 7th, a crime against humanity was committed in southern Israel. Armed members of Hamas invaded homes and massacred families. At the International Nature and Peace Festival in Re‚Äôim Forest, they killed hundreds. In all, more than a thousand civilians were murdered in cold blood. Thousands more were injured. Over a hundred, including infants, children, women, disabled, and elderly were dragged into Gaza as hostages. Women were raped. Women were also displayed in the streets of Gaza and on media platforms. These horrific acts were not committed by people whose rationality had been warped by the prolonged Israeli siege on Gaza. It was a well-planned and well-organized deed perpetrated by more than a thousand armed men, loyal to a terrorist organization funded by Qatar and the Iranian Ayatollah regime. Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 in a violent coup against the Palestinian Authority (PA). Since then, it has established its rule over that devastated strip of land, holding Gazans hostage to its fundamentalist ambitions. Ironically, Israel under Netanyahu sought to strengthen Hamas, reasoning that it would weaken the PA and reduce pressure on Israel to negotiate peace. In January 2023, Netanyahu's sixth government was formed, with key positions granted to extreme and fascist elements. Since its establishment, it has worked towards one goal: to eliminate the independence of the judicial system, removing this obstacle to annexing the West Bank. In parallel, the government negotiated economic steps with Hamas, thus recognizing it as the legitimate ruler of Gaza. Against Netanyahu‚Äôs attempt to turn Israel into a dictatorial and halakhic state, an unprecedented protest movement has emerged, involving hundreds of thousands. This movement, which has raised the banner of democracy for all, opposes the settler-controlled apartheid regime in the West Bank. The conflict between the protest movement and the Netanyahu government reached its peak when thousands of reservists, pilots, and senior officers declared that they would refuse to serve in the army if Israel became a dictatorship. The massacre carried out on October 7 in the southern communities of Israel exposed Hamas for what it is: not a liberation movement, not freedom fighters, but an organization of fanatics, twin to ISIS, spreading death and chaos. Simultaneously, the failures of the Netanyahu government were exposed in all their breadth. His full-scale rightwing coalition talked big about security but abandoned its citizens in the hour of need, having shifted most of the army to the West Bank to protect settlers. MAAN Workers Association joins US President Joe Biden and the democratic camp worldwide in calling for the elimination of the Hamas regime in Gaza and the threat it poses to Israelis and Palestinians. After this task is accomplished, we will continue to work with hundreds of thousands of Israelis who have sworn to remove Netanyahu and his extremist partners from the Israeli political scene. We and the rest of the protest movement will strive to build a new democratic alternative in Israel, one that will provide hope for both Israelis and Palestinians, promoting sanity and peace. As an organization that includes in its ranks both Israelis and Palestinians, MAAN opposes the voices that lump all Palestinians with Hamas and call for the flattening of Gaza. It is essential to distinguish between Hamas and the Palestinian people who have been suffocating under Israeli occupation. The just war against Hamas must be conducted while upholding international law, which prohibits harm to civilians. The order of the day is to fight simultaneously against both Hamas and the Netanyahu-Smotrich-Ben Gvir alliance. It is a battle against religious extremism on both sides, in which the fanaticism of one fuels that of the other. Neither represents its people, who in each case yearn for peace and security.",,239,"{'like_count': 186, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 23481}",◊û◊¢◊ü ◊ê◊®◊í◊ï◊ü ◊¢◊ï◊ë◊ì◊ô◊ù  ŸÖÿπŸãÿß - ŸÜŸÇÿßÿ®ÿ© ÿπŸÖÿßŸÑŸäÿ© MAAN Workers Association,,2023-10-12 13:21:47,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/274632807_319645440188913_1253191831721657990_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=UYcgPcOKM-gAX8dNLnC&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBjuQWloX-JD0tymPF0wujMPdzjq-sLEhEc65Uyi8A4LQ&oe=6559BFB5,https://www.facebook.com/100064303794876/posts/707301594756627,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391589727_707301414756645_5521523504457172192_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=p6u0ICxW7q8AX-3H7EE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfB_ZK2se8hFTR-h53dxb3_b8p8W7lCL_2NuCAek5SyjhA&oe=652C9597
facebook,"Pagi tadi saya telah menjawab soalan daripada YB Tuan Tan Hong Pin dari Parlimen Bakri dalam Sesi Pertanyaan Menteri (MQT) berkenaan langkah-langkah yang diambil Kerajaan Malaysia dalam membantu mangsa di Gaza. Kerajaan Malaysia senantiasa menyalurkan bantuan kepada rakyat Palestin dalam apa jua bentuk dan keadaan. Mengambil kira situasi kritikal pada masa ini, Malaysia menggesa masyarakat antarabangsa termasuk Pertubuhan-Pertubuhan Antarabangsa perlu segera menyalurkan bantuan kemanusiaan seperti bekalan-bekalan asas dan perubatan. Kita juga dalam usaha untuk melakukan evakuasi 5 rakyat Malaysia keluar dari kawasan konflik. Kerjasama antara negara juga sedang giat dijalankan. Bagi pihak Kementerian Luar Negeri, kita telah mengambil inisiatif menubuhkan Tabung Akaun Amanah Kemanusiaan Rakyat Palestin (AAKRP) sejak beberapa tahun dahulu. Sebagai permulaan, saya juga telah menyampaikan bantuan awal RM 1 juta daripada AAKRP untuk diberi kepada rakyat Palestin. Atas sebab itu juga, saya dan beberapa Ahli Parlimen daripada semua pihak tidak kira latar belakang politik telah menyampaikan bantuan ini terus kepada TYT Walid Abu Ali, Duta Besar Palestin ke Malaysia di perkarangan Lobi Parlimen tengah hari tadi. Ini merupakan komitmen berterusan Malaysia dalam membantu rakyat Palestin dalam apa jua cara dan kaedah. AAKRP juga boleh digunakan oleh orang awam atau mana-mana pihak untuk menyalurkan bantuan bagi meringankan beban rakyat Palestin yang terjejas akibat konflik. Sokongan rakyat Malaysia tanpa mengira latar belakang dan pahaman politik menjadi tunjang kekuatan untuk memberi kekuatan kepada rakyat Palestin bagi terus kekal berjuang dan juga sebagai tanda solidariti Malaysia untuk Palestin. ---------------------- Earlier this morning I answered a question posed by YB Tuan Tan Hong Pin (Bakri) in the Minister's Question Session (MQT) regarding measures taken by the Malaysian Government to assist victims in Gaza. The Malaysian government always lend assistance to the Palestinian in any forms. Considering the critical situation at the moment, Malaysia urges the international community including International Organisations to immediately channel humanitarian aids, including basic supplies and medicine. We are also trying to evacuate 5 Malaysians out of the conflict area. Cooperation between countries is also actively being carried out. On behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have taken the initiative to establish the Palestine Humanitarian Trust Account Fund (AAKRP) several years ago. For a start, I have delivered an initial aid of RM 1 million from AAKRP to the Palestinian. For that reason too, together with a number of MPs across political divides, we have delivered the aid directly to HE Walid Abu Ali, the Palestinian Ambassador to Malaysia at the Parliament Lobby compound this afternoon. This serves as an indication of Malaysia's continued commitment in assisting the Palestinian. AAKRP can also be used by the public or any party to channel aid to ease the burden of the Palestinian affected by the conflict. The support of Malaysian regardless of background and political divides is a pillar of strength in advancing the Palestinian cause and a sign of Malaysia's solidarity to the Palestine. #wismaputra #doczam #MalaysiaMadani #prayforpalestine",,239,"{'like_count': 107, 'comment_count': 29, 'num_users': 112955}",Zambry Abd.

facebook,"Does Victorian Socialists support attacks on civilians? Of course not. We're horrified at the many civilian deaths in this conflict. We're socialists (it's in the name). Our politics centres on the collective organisation and resistance of workers, and of ordinary people fighting for a better, fairer and more sustainable world. Will we join in the global chorus of people who think the most important thing right now is to condemn atrocities committed by one specific faction in this decades-long conflict? Also no. It should be clear by now the extent to which such condemnations, however well intended, help Israel justify the massacre it is carrying out in Gaza today (and, retrospectively, all the brutal policies of occupation and apartheid it has imposed on the Palestinians for decades). Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has himself made this clear. In 2019 he told a meeting of his faction in the Israeli Knesset that ‚ÄúAnyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas"". This isn't, like much of what has passed for 'facts' about this conflict on social media, 'fake news'. You can read about it in Israeli newspaper Haaretz here: https://archive.md/H8LSL#selection-1147.0-1147.313. The truth is that the quashing of secular, democratic resistance movements among the Palestinians has been a conscious strategy of the Israeli state since its foundation in 1948. You can read about that here: https://redflag.org.au/article/how-israel-strangles-palestines-democratic-resistance. It is worth quoting from the article: ""What would a perfect Palestinian resistance look like? Western liberals might like to see forms of activism that respect individual conscience and property rights: petitions, for example, and consumer boycotts. Socialists would no doubt prefer something based on working-class solidarity, strikes and the cross-sectarian mobilisation of the masses. What would Israel do, faced with such morally impeccable and strategically sound opposition? We don‚Äôt have to wonder. Since before the foundation of Israel, Zionists have systematically worked to strangle the development of any such resistance. They have arrested and killed non-violent activist leaders, reshaped the economy of Palestine to disintegrate its workers‚Äô movement, disrupted democratic electoral processes and herded most Palestinians into police states in which normal political organisation is near impossible."" As socialists we think our first duty is to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people in their more than 70 year long struggle for justice. And we think expressing such solidarity should always come first, particularly at a time like now. We encourage our members and supporters to do everything they can to attend this Sunday's rally organised by Free Palestine Melbourne, 12pm at the State Library.

facebook,"THE HISTORY OF NDI MBA ·ªåZ·ªå KA ND·ªä ·ªåCHA JI JIDE ANY·ªä NA ALA NA AN·ª§ OBALA ANY·ªä . I am shocked this morning to my bone marrow while trying to do a research about Jelusalem & Israel. Every ref took me to Bible record. Does it mean that the Bible is part of the historical record book of Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria and present Palestine today? OMG, it's good to do research about about certain things you don't know. Now why did the Europeans invaded Akebulan (Africa) destroy the original documents of the Akebulan (Africa) killed our ancestors then replaced our original history with the history book of the Arabian and Middle East called the (Holy Bible) ?. Why? As I type this message now there re millions of goosebumps all over me. No wonder the Asians and Arabians did not accept that book because they knew the origin and whose history it was. No wonder they re not waiting for that God in the history book of the Arabians and Middle East called (Bible) to fight for them nor save them. They build arms to fight and defend themselves. A physical evidence is currently going on in the middle east now as Hamas have physically attacked the Israelite with weapons made by human being. And in response the Israelites re responding with theirs too. They did not wait for God or Jesus to come and fight for them. No wonder they don't pray in Jesus name yet they Prosper more than those that were deceived with that history book of the Arabians and middle east. Where is our own ancestral holy book? They did not only made us weak with that book they also changed our names to theirs. In other words crushing our future existence with reckless abandon. Why are they continously destroying our history, culture and heritage tagging them idols /evil then replacing them with theirs which is more alien to our projectors. As we re busy praying with holy water and fasting in the name and blood of Jesus in churches the Europeans re busy stealing our natural mineral resources using them to beautiful their own countries. Then in return offering us visa lottery to come and serve them just to get a greener pastures. As we re busy hoping on jesus to bless and save us they re busy building arms, chemical weapons that can wipe us away from this surface of earth with the knowledge that the Jesus they have to us cannot save us from the weapon of mass destruction they re manufacturing. As we re busy praying with the Bible they gave to us, Boko Haram, Issis and Fulani herdsmen re busy killing us and trying to take over our ancestral land. Chineke ekwela ihe ·ªçj·ªç·ªç. Now I understand why they don't want the Nation of Biafra restored. None of us can count nor mentioned upto 30 names of their Ancestors step by step. But we re reading and praying to the name of their ancestors of over 2,000 years ago. We even love and we adore them while hating and mostly forgetting our own ancestors, seeing them as evil but praying to nd·ªã Ichie nd·ªã mba ·ªçz·ªç as HOLY Joseph, Issac, and Braham. no be juju be that? üôÑ ü§î üôÑ From all indication, based on the fact I have today. I agree totally with #MNK that the only way which the people of Akebulan (Africa) can be saved is the restoration of the land of the rising sun (Biafra). A free Biafra nation will not only restore peace in Africa but will also restore sanity and drive the greatest development from this side of the world. We must restore our originality, We must restore our ancestral land (BIAFRA). We must go back to our original route to avoid this conflict between the Israel üáÆüá± and Palestine. Go do ur research before you go contrary to this undiluted epistle of mine which is written with verifiable evidence.

There is lots of noise online and plenty of disinformation and misinformation out there designed to make people panic. There are no credible threats of violence anywhere in the City of New York.

New York City public schools will remain open. While there are no known or credible threats at this time, we will remain vigilant. Working with our local precincts, I will make sure we continue to have an increased police presence and visibility on our streets, especially near our schools and all houses of worship tomorrow.

facebook,"October 03, 2023 To: Humanitarian organisations Subject: I am not a refugee or a returnee; I am a mother who has lost her children fleeing a conflict Dear world, I have been at the hospital for three weeks, watching over my eight-year-old son and my five-year-old daughter, both suffering from malnutrition. They are not the same as I remember them back in our home city of Khartoum. They are receiving special food and medicines, and a doctor checks their vital signs many times a day. Our lives changed in April. We were a family of eight living in Khartoum. I was at home caring for my six children, and my husband was earning enough as a construction worker. My youngest was a baby who I still breastfed. Needless to say, our home was full, and children were running and playing all over the place. Everything was okay until we heard the bombs and gunshots; neighbours and people we knew were dying. As a family, we decided to leave. My husband stayed behind, and my six children and I embarked on a journey to South Sudan, the country we had originally migrated from. We took a bus, and from one displacement camp to another, we started moving. As we arrived in Alagaya camp within Sudan, the children started to fall sick; they had measles. The baby was the first to get a fever; after one week, the three-year-old and later the nine-year-old one. They died. I had to bury my three children far from home. Far from anyone they knew. Far from where we were going. As I continued my journey to South Sudan, I arrived at Renk, where I discovered that my eight-year-old son and my five-year-old daughter were malnourished. The change in food, the long journey and the grief have been arduous for me and my family. I have lost three children, and the other two are fighting for their lives. Every day at the hospital, I find the strength to look after them. I cook what I can with the other mothers who also have their children at the hospital. We sit under a tree. The other children play; they climb trees, and I can't wait for my children to be among them. Many families here struggle for food and water. Hardly anyone has a proper shelter. As soon as my children feel better, my husband will join us and we will continue our journey, maybe to Malakal. I will try to contact my extended family in South Sudan, but I am uncertain of the future. We would need a lot of courage and help to survive during the coming difficult days to start a new life in South Sudan. My house will still be half full.

facebook,"Larry Schmidt, 89, of Baxter, Iowa, passed away on October 11, 2023. Funeral services for Larry will be held on Saturday, October 14th, 2023, at Baxter High School. Visitation begins at 10:00 A.M. Brunch will be served from 11:00 A.M. to 12:15 P.M. The service will begin at 1:00 P.M. with a graveside committal at Restland Cemetery in Baxter to follow at a later date. Larry was born and raised in Baxter, and he attended Baxter High School. He lived in Baxter the majority of his life and raised his family here in Baxter with his loving wife, Janice. No one could say that Larry wasn't involved in his community. In fact, he made it a point to be as involved as he possibly could. He belonged to Baxter Congregational Church, the Baxter American Legion, was a past member of the Baxter Booster Club, became an EMT for the Baxter Ambulance Crew. Larry held many jobs throughout his life. He was an assembler at Maytag for 31 years, retiring in 1983. You may think retirement would slow him down, but Larry went right on to become a Baxter school bus driver, a position he held for 32 years. He loved spending time with the kids of Baxter over the years. In addition to driving the school bus Monday through Friday, he'd also drive for school trips and would even take bus loads to the Iowa State Fair. He was also a Boy Scout Master and Eagle Scout. Additionally, he had a love of baseball and softball. He was a Fast Pitch Softball pitcher for 40 years, he participated in weekend tournaments, playing in 60-70 games a year and would help coach the kids in his free time. If that wasn't enough, Larry also took pride in working on the Baxter Softball Field. Larry loved his country. He served in the U.S. Army during the Korea Conflict and American Legion. Larry loved life. From fireworks and 4th of July parties, and even being honored as Baxter Grand Parade Marshall twice, he lived loud and proud every single day he could. Whether that was volunteering, driving the school bus, working in his glass repair shop, woodworking, spending time with his grandkids or even just kicking back to enjoy a classic Western or a baseball game, Larry's love for life showed in every part of him. In his later years he enjoyed making wooden trucks and tractors, only to give them away to kids in need. He would say ‚Äúevery kid deserves a toy‚Äù. Larry's memory will be cherished by his wife, Janice (Shore) Schmidt; his sons Gary Schmidt, Ed (Deanna) Schmidt, Brian (Julie) Schmidt, and Adam (Connie) Schmidt; his grandchildren Jason Kutzner, Jamie Schmidt, Marcus (Shelby) Schmidt, Sydney (Chase) Gratopp, Riley Schmidt, Yara, Joseph and River Schmidt; his great-grandchild Asher Schmidt; his sister Joan Smith; his daughter-in-law Sally Schmidt; his many nieces and nephews; and his many, many friends. It was well known that Larry never knew a stranger. Larry was preceded in death by his parents, John and Beulah (Patterson) Schmidt; his son Steven Schmidt; and his siblings Leona Fahrney, Nadine Dee, John Jr. Schmidt, Leland Schmidt, Charles Schmidt, Esther Shattuck, Richard Schmidt, Margaret Ann Swalwell, and Eugene Schmidt.

facebook,"Gullveig: The goddess and witch of Norse mythology Norse mythology, a rich and complex collection of tales about the gods, heroes, and creatures of ancient Scandinavia, is home to many fascinating characters, some of whom are described in the epic Eddas and other historical texts. One of these characters is Gullveig, a mysterious and powerful woman who is often described as a goddess and a witch. In this article we will look at the myth, meaning and influence of Gullveig in Norse mythology. Origin and narrative The best-known story about Gullveig can be found in the V√∂lusp√°, one of the poems in the Older Edda. The V√∂lusp√° is a prophetic poem sung by a seeress who predicts the creation and end of the world. The poem tells how Gullveig, often associated with gold or with power and wealth, came to the gods and was thrown into the fire three times and reborn each time. Her name itself can be translated as ""gold power"" or ""gold addiction"". This act of violence against Gullveig was one of the catalysts for the war between the Aesir and the Vanir, the two main groups of Norse gods. The interpretations of Gullveig Gullveig is an elusive character, and there are various interpretations as to who she really was and what role she played in mythology. Gullveig as a goddess of wealth and power: Some believe that Gullveig was a goddess of wealth and power. Her name, meaning ""Gold Power,"" may indicate her connection to gold and power. She could also be seen as the embodiment of human desires and temptations. Gullveig as a witch and sorceress: Some interpretations portray Gullveig as a powerful witch or sorceress who was able to regenerate through her powers and spells. The fact that she was burned and reborn three times could demonstrate her magical abilities and immortality. Gullveig as a connection between the Aesir and the Vanir: Since the conflict over Gullveig led to the war between the Aesir and the Vanir, she could also be seen as a symbolic figure that embodies the tensions and differences between the two groups of gods. Gullveig's influence and significance The myth of Gullveig has profound meanings in Norse mythology. First, it shows the tensions and conflicts between the different groups of gods and how human emotions such as envy, greed and power can further exacerbate these tensions. Secondly, the story of Gullveig also highlights the power and importance of women in Norse mythology. Despite the violence inflicted on her, Gullveig could not be destroyed. This could be seen as evidence of the strength, resilience and power of women in an often male-dominated world. Finally, Gullveig is also a symbol of eternal regeneration and rebirth. Despite all the adversities she faced, she was continually reborn, suggesting the cyclical nature of life and the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. Closing remarks The story of Gullveig is a captivating and enigmatic piece of Norse mythology. She embodies many of the central themes and motifs of these myths: conflict, power, regeneration and the role of women. Even though many questions about her remain unanswered, the figure of Gullveig offers a fascinating insight into the thoughts and ideas of the ancient Scandinavians. by Jatukham Ramathep",,221,"{'like_count': 118, 'comment_count': 30, 'num_users': 412086}","All Pagan, Norse & Heathens",,2023-10-12 12:24:46,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/19399657_1928955530675573_8556355811557297426_n.jpg?stp=c19.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f2fd11&_nc_ohc=exw_r9l_Sx4AX_f_0h6&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBShe58fB_LIePTzMlN1y2LQgelIYEWP_PGxOOwdP9fsA&oe=657D31DB,https://www.facebook.com/groups/138827139978186/permalink/1698206974040187,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/384287280_2419587824879341_6597196601581099068_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=vFf6CYS9XJMAX_5cYgj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCAaPmUCar5trIvGn81K6rtMd_u2jnDCH90ktdrxAVoTA&oe=653100D3

facebook,"The miserable fact of The Voice: We were always destined to get to this point By Niki Savva and The Sydney Morning Herald When Peter Dutton ran for the Liberal leadership in 2018, he twice asked Ken Wyatt to vote for him. Dutton told Wyatt he wanted him on his frontbench. Wyatt told Dutton both times that he would not vote for him. Furthermore, he told him that if he became leader, he would not serve under him, he would quit the ministry. Beyond expressing concern for the sexual abuse of children, Dutton showed little interest in Indigenous issues, according to Wyatt. When we spoke a few days ago, Wyatt was as unsurprised as he was unimpressed by Dutton‚Äôs conduct of the No campaign in the referendum. Wyatt dismissed the fevered commentary about Jacinta Nampijinpa Price becoming prime minister. He reckons for a leader to succeed, she ‚Äì or he ‚Äì must be capable of, and be seen to be working for, all Australians. He believes neither Dutton nor Price has shown they can do that. Going down in history as two of the people most responsible for destroying a referendum which Wyatt is convinced would help Indigenous people is no qualification for national leadership in Wyatt‚Äôs view. Born on a mission station to a mother who was forced to hand over her wages to bureaucrats then ask for money back to buy essentials, Wyatt was the first Indigenous person to become Indigenous affairs minister under Scott Morrison. He quit the Liberal Party in protest in April. Clinging to hope that Yes would triumph, Wyatt worried defeat would deter future governments from considering new approaches. He accepts Anthony Albanese would have no mandate to legislate a Voice but pledged he and fellow Yes warriors would not give up fighting for better ways to address Indigenous disadvantage. In the post-mortems which will inevitably continue for decades, we can and we will blame No campaigners for playing filthy dirty, for putting politics above everything else, for using loudhailers to whistle up the neo-Nazis, racists and bigots with lies and misrepresentations. The demons unleashed by tactics to foment conflict, for short term political gain at the expense of vulnerable Australians, will live on long after Saturday‚Äôs vote. We can and will blame the Albanese government for choosing the wrong time or the wrong words or for mismanaging the campaign, for doing it now, or even for doing it at all. The miserable fact is that no matter the wording, the content, or the timing, we were always destined to get to this point. A few Yes campaigners, including Wyatt, firmly believe this. There was never going to be bipartisanship. Releasing exposure draft legislation would only have given the Noes more ammunition. Legislating the Voice alone would have once again been whitefellas telling blackfellas what was best for them. Delaying the referendum until the next election would have guaranteed the loss of both the election and the referendum. Yes advocates say the Noes tapped into a deep well of racism, others that the referendum has created a hell of a mess. The Noes blame Yes for dividing Australia, which is a bit like claiming black is white. They claim it‚Äôs the biggest change to the Constitution ever proposed. Wrong. That was the republic. Their most potent argument against that was if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it. Those same people, notably Tony Abbott, know this system is broken, offer no solution and instead seek to destroy the Voice by claiming it will encourage ‚Äúseparatism.‚Äù As if such a modest change to set up an advisory body creates a new apartheid. Confronted by tough questioning, they scream bias. In fact, they have had a good run. Too good. As the most prominent, the most effective and most polarising participant in the black-on-black conflict, Price has called the shots for the Coalition. She says up front what many of them think but few dare to say. The photo of Price acting as barista in a Perth cafe with Dutton smiling awkwardly behind her like a mobile coffee caddy, says it all. (Image 2) Not only has she has given white folk an excuse to vote no, she has absolved them of any guilt or shame for past wrongs by insisting colonisation had benefited Aboriginal people. Read David Marr‚Äôs excellent book Killing for Country and judge for yourself. Another of the many low points of this campaign was when the media and others perversely condemned Indigenous leader Marcia Langton for calling out racism, rather than condemn the racism itself. We live in dangerous times when Ray Martin cops more abuse from the Noes for using words like dinosaurs and dickheads than does a neo-Nazi who threatens to kill a senator. Dutton questioning the integrity of an institution as highly regarded as the Australian Electoral Commission was inexcusable. It opened the door wide for conspiracy theorists to harass and abuse the commission and its staff. This is a defining moment for Australia. Almost every other country on earth has reached an accommodation (truncated)",,216,"{'like_count': 68, 'comment_count': 53, 'num_users': 33589}",National Times,,2023-10-12 00:05:37,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/301811532_470242761783518_8946486792091417766_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=TJWwP4F4DvsAX-8W46M&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAdUlzgUutu5iQ7JYaSmbT9n3y6YdR1UqqSgzcUnd6_zQ&oe=655B5141,https://www.facebook.com/100063933949974/posts/754859536655171,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/387147960_754859496655175_1272501479141601992_n.jpg?stp=cp1_dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5614bc&_nc_ohc=mroPeii9mRUAX_7_qlf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfC-vFnqJDErZcgdfxNBWF44Kad6CzAr02GlUbLweg4jHA&oe=652B6706

MERCY Malaysia has been operating in Palestine since 2003, providing humanitarian assistance and development aid by providing medical support, food aid, clean water access, shelter, community development programmes, sustainable livelihood, education, and mental health and psychosocial support programs. Over the years, MERCY Malaysia‚Äôs initiatives have manage to slightly reduce the affected people‚Äôs humanitarian burden, and help support them continue to live their life normally. However, the number of affected population and the needs for humanitarian, as well as development remains high in this conflict, which is one of the world‚Äôs longest continuing conflicts. The relief aid distribution aimed to provide much-needed support to the people residing in the Gaza Strip, reaffirming MERCY Malaysia commitment to alleviating their suffering and promoting resilience within the community. Other live saving initiatives are being conducted, which include supply of medicines and providing fuels to operate ambulance as the conflict‚Äôs casualties have not been restricted to combatants, with a large number of civilian fatalities on both sides.

facebook,"To make sense of the world today it is vital to understand how propaganda works, how insidious it is and just how prevalent it has become. ""Probably every conflict is fought on at least two grounds: the battlefield and the minds of the people via propaganda. The good guys and the bad guys can often both be guilty of misleading their people with distortions, exaggerations, subjectivity, inaccuracy and even fabrications, in order to receive support and a sense of legitimacy. ""Propaganda can serve to rally people behind a cause, but often at the cost of exaggerating, misrepresenting, or even lying about the issues in order to gain that support ... As the various examples below will show, common tactics in propaganda often used by either side include: ‚Ä¢ Using selective stories that come over as wide-covering and objective. ‚Ä¢ Partial facts, or historical context ‚Ä¢ Reinforcing reasons and motivations to act due to threats on the security of the individual. ‚Ä¢ Narrow sources of experts to provide insights in to the situation. (For example, the mainstream media typically interview retired military personnel for many conflict-related issues, or treat official government sources as fact, rather than just one perspective that needs to be verified and researched). ‚Ä¢ Demonizing the enemy who does not fit the picture of what is right. ‚Ä¢ Using a narrow range of discourse, whereby judgments are often made while the boundary of discourse itself, or the framework within which the opinions are formed, are often not discussed. The narrow focus then helps to serve the interests of the propagandists."" [...] ""The list of tactics used in propaganda listed further above is also expressed in a similar way by Johann Galtung, a professor of Peace Studies and summarized here by Danny Schechter: ""[Professor] Galtung laid out 12 points of concern where journalism often goes wrong when dealing with violence. Each implicitly suggests more explicit remedies. ‚Ä¢ Decontextualizing violence: focusing on the irrational without looking at the reasons for unresolved conflicts and polarization. ‚Ä¢ Dualism: reducing the number of parties in a conflict to two, when often more are involved. Stories that just focus on internal developments often ignore such outside or external forces as foreign governments and transnational companies. ‚Ä¢ Manicheanism: portraying one side as good and demonizing the other as evil. ‚Ä¢ Armageddon: presenting violence as inevitable, omitting alternatives. ‚Ä¢ Focusing on individual acts of violence while avoiding structural causes, like poverty, government neglect and military or police repression. ‚Ä¢ Confusion: focusing only on the conflict arena (i.e., the battlefield or location of violent incidents) but not on the forces and factors that influence the violence. ‚Ä¢ Excluding and omitting the bereaved, thus never explaining why there are acts of revenge and spirals of violence. ‚Ä¢ Failure to explore the causes of escalation and the impact of media coverage itself. ‚Ä¢ Failure to explore the goals of outside interventionists, especially big powers. ‚Ä¢ Failure to explore peace proposals and offer images of peaceful outcomes. ‚Ä¢ Confusing cease-fires and negotiations with actual peace. ‚Ä¢ Omitting reconciliation: conflicts tend to reemerge if attention is not paid to efforts to heal fractured societies. When news about attempts to resolve conflicts are absent, fatalism is reinforced. That can help engender even more violence, when people have no images or information about possible peaceful outcomes and the promise of healing. - Danny Schechter, Covering Violence: How Should Media Handle Conflict?, July 18, 2001"" To read more: https://www.globalissues.org/article/157/war-propaganda-and-the-media In the words of the father of modern propaganda, Edward Bernay‚Äôs; ‚ÄúTHE conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.

 The horror of innocent humans brutally torn from their loved ones, beaten, imprisoned, tortured and diabolically terrorized is something that tears at the heart of anyone with a heart capable of beating for their fellow man.

 As parents, how can we not put ourselves in the shoes of those parents whose children's fate is unknown to them!

 As human beings, how can we not feel the dramatic echo of so much suffering!

 As human beings, where can we find hope, optimism, joy of life, when so much of our unfortunate humanity can go?

Yet each of us knows in his conscience that every conflict, from the most trivial to the most bitter, is always and only an intellectual accident. We all know the weapons with which we could avoid their tragic consequences. What prevents us from using them?

 As people of faith, we pray with all our hearts that this will end as soon as possible; that everyone will be able to reunite with their loved ones and return to their homes. Let us pray.

We are safe but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the situation here is normal, Hebron city is already in a sensitive point, the coming weeks might be worse.

üáÆüá± Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant briefed his NATO counterparts by videoconference on the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas against Israeli civilians. Condemning Hamas‚Äô terrorist attacks, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg said:

‚ùùIsrael has the right to defend itself and as the conflict unfolds, the protection of civilians is essential‚Äù. He added that ‚Äúno nation or organisation hostile to Israel should seek to take advantage of the situation, or to escalate the conflict.‚ùû
‚Ä®On the Western Balkans, Mr Stoltenberg said that NATO has deployed hundreds of extra troops to Kosovo to ensure KFOR has the forces it needs to fulfil its UN mandate impartially. He called on Belgrade and Pristina to ‚Äúbehave responsibly, refrain from destabilising actions, and re-engage in the EU-facilitated dialogue‚Äù. He added that in Bosnia, NATO continues to support the EU-led operation Althea, which plays a key role for regional stability. On Iraq, NATO‚Äôs mission is evolving to provide more support to the Iraqi security forces.

On deterrence and defence, Allies discussed the next steps in operationalising NATO‚Äôs new defence plans, including by assigning forces, developing new capabilities, and adjusting command and control. Mr Stoltenberg also noted that NATO will start its long-planned nuclear exercise ‚ÄúSteadfast Noon‚Äù next week. The exercise will send ‚Äúa clear message that NATO will protect and defend all Allies,‚Äù the Secretary General said.‚Ä®¬†‚Ä®Ministers also addressed damage to critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.

In an email sent to its members subscribed to the newsletter, Playboy announced that it has terminated its relationship with Khalifa and also deleted her channel on their creator platform. 

The magazine also said in its mail that while the organisation encourages free expression and constructive political debate, it has a zero tolerance policy towards hate speech. 

Not only Playboy, she has also been canned from a podcast deal with Canada-based podcaster and radio show host Todd Shapiro over her support for Palestine in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says the number of displaced people increased by 30% over 24 hours, with the majority of those civilians sheltering inside U.N. schools.

This comes amid a looming Israeli ground invasion of Gaza that could destroy even more of the territory and raise casualty figures. So far in this conflict, some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel and 1,100 inside Gaza, with thousands more injured on both sides.

instagram,"I think there's just too much pressure that people put on the word Love.

Like it's just supposed to solve everything. Like it's a cure all to every problem and that just by saying ""I love you"" everything magically becomes okay.

But then why do so many of us look for someone else to talk to when something goes wrong? Why do we seek out someone who maybe be more willing to listen to what we are going through and give us advice? Why do we want someone who understands what we are going through rather than just someone who tells us they love us?

It's so hard to be one person, now imagine what it's like having to deal with all the emotions of two.

And maybe that's why people are always so unsure about love. Why things go down hill so often when there is a fight. Why they run away from any kind of conflict. And why we seek out the company of old friends who have known us for a while to sit with and talk to.

It's hard to open up to someone and harder still when it's about something that scares you. And I know love scares you. Losing someone you care about scares you.

Which is why sometimes just being understanding of someone's emotions, of their fears, of what they are going through in life is enough.

Friends who share memes are sometimes even more appreciated that one's who share love notes.

Because sometimes, understanding is just better than love.

Prince Mohammed received a call from Raisi, during which they discussed the ‚Äúcurrent military situation in Gaza and its environs‚Äù, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.

The call lasted for 45 minutes. They discussed the urgent need to end the ongoing war crimes against Palestinians.

The Crown Prince stressed that the Kingdom is making all possible efforts to engage with international and regional parties to stop the current escalation.

He reiterated Saudi Arabia‚Äôs stance against any form of targeting civilians.

instagram,"‚ÄòOperation Ajay‚Äô set to evacuate Indian nationals from Israel. Special flight likely to take off for India on October 12.

India is putting in place a major operation to evacuate its citizens who wish to return from conflict-hit Israel. Announcing the initiative late on Wednesday, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said special chartered flights are being arranged. 

This will be the second evacuation this year, after Operation Kaveri that brought back several thousand Indian citizens from conflict-torn Sudan in April-May. 

‚ÄúLaunching Operation Ajay to facilitate the return from Israel of our citizens who wish to return. Special charter flights and other arrangements being put in place. Fully committed to the safety and well-being of our nationals abroad,‚Äù posted Mr. Jaishankar on X, formerly Twitter. 

The Indian Embassy in Tel Aviv stated that it has emailed the first lot of registered Indian citizens for the special flight that is expected to take off for India on Thursday. ‚ÄúMessages to other registered people will follow for subsequent flights,‚Äù said the embassy in a post on X.

The announcement has come days after Air India suspended its service in the Delhi-Tel Aviv route as Hamas carried out a crippling attack on Israel last Saturday. Following that ground, sky and sea attack, Israel has launched a massive military strike against Gaza Strip. The rapid escalation has also drawn the Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, which has lobbed rockets at Israel‚Äôs northern territory drawing Israeli strikes. The situation has turned the sky above Israel risky prompting cancellation of many international flights. 

A source indicated that the scale of Operation Ajay will depend on demand and that the government will augment capacities depending on further need.

Control room set up
India has been preparing for the escalating situation soon after the conflict erupted on Saturday. On Wednesday, the Ministry of External Affairs set up a 24-hour control room, which will operate simultaneously from New Delhi, Tel Aviv and Ramallah in the Palestinian territory.

And humanitarian groups are warning of a coming crisis if Israel follows through on its vow to cut off food, water and electricity to Gaza, where nearly half of residents are under 18 years of age.‚Å†
‚Å†
The news is alarming for anyone ‚Äî and especially for children, who may be left grappling with questions about why other children are among those affected, and whether they are safe. Here's some advice on how to get started with talking to kids about the conflict.‚Å†

Yet, to resolve the issues facing us today, we must understand the path that led to this moment.

Addressing ""where do we go from here?"" first requires answering ""how did we get here?"" In supporting liberation for all oppressed peoples, including our Palestinian and Jewish relatives, we look to history to teach us the right steps forward.

In treaty negotiations with the U.S. government, it is said that Sitting Bull remarked, ""Let us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our children."" We heed Sitting Bull's wisdom as we pray for healing and an end to violence in Palestine/Israel.

Justin Bieber faced criticism for a social media post related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. He originally posted ""Praying for Israel"" on Instagram with a photo of Gaza, which caused controversy. 

Realizing the mistake, he deleted the post and replaced it with a plain background and the same message along with a heartbreak emoji. The incident garnered attention and drew criticism from some of his followers who felt he lacked understanding of the situation.

instagram,"‚ö°Ô∏èBIZARRE: A youth from Uttar Pradesh extends support to Israel amidst the conflict with Gaza by getting a tattoo of the India-Israel flag. [ANI]

Amidst the terror attack in Israel, India has also extended its support for Israel.

The ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict has triggered a series of warnings from either side, with the latest being Hamas Commander Mahmoud al-Zahar's radical ambition to dominate the globe.

In a recent viral video, Mahmoud al-Zahar claimed that Israel is merely the initial target and that they aim to extend their influence over the entire world.

""The entire 510 million square kilometres of Planet Earth will come under a system where there is no injustice, no oppression, and no killings and crimes like those being committed against the Palestinians and the Arabs in all the Arab countries, in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and other countries,"" the Hamas Commander added.

Responding to this, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement asserting his commitment to continue the fight against Hamas, stating that every member of the Palestinian group was ""a dead man"".

""Hamas is Daesh (the Islamic State group), and we will crush them and destroy them as the world has destroyed Daesh,"" he said.

This has been regarded as the placebo effect amid the declaration of war by Israel against Hamas over the horrifying weekend attack in which hundreds of Israelis were killed. 

Further, according to the latest updates, more than 1,200 people have been killed in Israel and over 2,800 people have been injured. Over 1055 people have been killed and 5183 have been injured till now in Gaza.

instagram,"Amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, Israeli media reported that the Palestinian militant group ‚ÄúHamas beheaded 40 babies‚Äù in Israel. However, no proof has been found over the same, neither has the IDF confirmed or denied it.

US President Joe Biden was also among those who rushed to verify the claims, claiming to have seen photos. However, the White House was later forced to issue a clarification.

‚ÄòHamas beheaded 40 babies‚Äô

This horrifying headline has gone viral after i24NEWS reporter Nicole Zedek‚Äôs ground-breaking report revealed the extreme brutality in Kfar Aza Kibbutz.

During her coverage on Tuesday morning, October 10, Zedek claimed that Israeli soldiers had told her ‚Äúthey believe 40 babies/children were killed.‚Äù

Several websites, including CBS, The Times, Metro, Daily Express, The Scotsman, Financial Times and the Times of India, also featured stories, citing the i24 claims.

But hours later, Turkey‚Äôs Anadolu Agency reported that the Israeli army had neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.

‚ÄúWe have seen the news, but we do not have any details or confirmation about that,‚Äù the unnamed spokesperson told the agency.

instagram,"World News:
Amid the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict, the European Union has called on the CEOs of Meta and X to take proactive measures against ""misinformation"" on its platforms. 

In a recent letter, Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for Internal Market, expressed concerns to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg regarding the ""surge of illegal content and disinformation being disseminated in the EU via certain platforms."" Breton emphasized the need for Meta to uphold the Digital Services Act's mandates, noting that platforms should exhibit ""timely, diligent and objective action"" against flagged illegal content and enforce ""proportionate and effective mitigation measures.""

X, previously known as Twitter, received a similar warning from Breton. He said that despite warnings, questionable content persisted on X's platform, underscoring the responsibility of owner Elon Musk to intervene when necessary. Breton advised Musk to be ""very transparent and clear"" regarding permissible content and to consistently apply and bolster platform policies, especially considering potential threats to public security and accurate discourse.

Responding to these critiques, X's trust and safety team asserted their commitment to ensuring platform integrity. They announced the removal of specific Hamas-linked accounts and the deletion of ""tens of thousands of posts"" containing ""violent or hate-driven content.""",,5948,"{'like_count': 5519, 'comment_count': 429, 'num_users': 966663}","Real News, Not Bullshit",,2023-10-12 15:04:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/210871732_2297447983890016_8350712253230690398_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=nBbjySDBVlQAX87JSho&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBk14T-MaDPBNwPwWX3loRBZR46eror1wY2VFxIvbBxVg&oe=6559C8F0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTZjd8r5xO/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390613071_161832986998921_5140776860285879090_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=jJMtkY9kcrsAX_qnp5A&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAw_mFtlm6O3aAd9tczXXzFm9ALlhzNj2xM5OGpQQBHVQ&oe=65350F95

Unfortunately, the region has been facing a humanitarian crisis for several years now.The healthcare system in Gaza is struggling to cope with the increasing demand for medical care due to the ongoing conflict and blockade.The education system is also underfunded and overcrowded. Gaza is one of the poorest regions in the world, and many people live below the poverty line.

instagram,"TAKE A MOMENT TO READ MY üíú ~ its only a 3 min read. 

Though I know some may criticize what I care to say here, I‚Äôm going to leave my comments ON for this post ~ out of respect and openness to learn something here. 

I have written and re written my feelings around the war raging now in the middle east.  I even wrote about MY ties to the region. 

For Clarity, I traveled to this region several times betweem 2008 and 2012. I was naive, But as I began to see, I was ALWAYS left with  more questions than opinions about this conflict. 

I‚Äôve made personal sacrifices (leaving behind BIG dreams) to adjust my proximity to this hot button issue ~ because I felt it was not my place to even BE in the conversation at all ~ MUCH longer story ~ there were personal elements too .. i digress. 

WHAT I MUST SAY, as a truth speaker and seeker: I live a life committed to peace ~ and Im everyday, praying and hurting  for EVERY innocent person in the line of fire.

And for what it‚Äôs worth, I have an ACTUAL prayer life.  And my prayer for humanity is that the chaos will give way to clarity, which will give way to peace. 

I KNOW, for those suffering and those feeling the heat of anger , its too soon to be talking about  praying for peace, 

And always have. There are MULTIPLE humanitarian crises on the planet RIGHT NOW.  So I ask you,  when is it NOT a time to pray for peace.  YES WE NEED MORE THAN PRAYERS ~ but .. real prayer warriors stand up! we know who we are. 

I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll say it again on this day when it MATTERS MORE! I condemn violence hate GENOCIDE, rape, colonialism ‚Ä¶. and especially the killing of children ANYWHERE EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME. 

I AM NOT NEUTRAL.  I am NOT neutral.  Whether I speak the words that way you would or not.

instagram,"STARTING PREP üñçÔ∏è
Walking into school orientation for Lola had me reflecting on all the nerves I had as a first time school mama and so, while I have these fresh in my mind I thought I‚Äôd share ‚úèÔ∏è‚Äô5 Things I Wish I Knew about having a School Kid‚Äô ‚úèÔ∏è 

The last one is what impacted us the most!

‚úèÔ∏è Checking they can open everything independently in their lunch box. Do a practice run and see if there is anything you pack that they struggle to open on their own. 
‚úèÔ∏è Schedule time in the weeks before and the week starting, to implement school life admin into your life. I was SO unaware of just how much school life entails. Man, oh man, the apps?!? If you set aside half an hour a week to keep an eye on these things you shouldn‚Äôt miss too many notices (lol.) 
‚úèÔ∏è If your kid gets homework, consider making time in the morning to do it. We found they have more brain energy and clarity then. Something to consider if afternoons aren‚Äôt working for you.
‚úèÔ∏è Dinner time chats- These have been so important. We don‚Äôt do this EVERY evening but sharing the tough parts about your day can help normalise vulnerability and conflict resolution as a family. Sharing a highlight and a lowlight of your week with them and asking them to do the same starts these conversations early.
‚úèÔ∏è You may find your Preppie overwhelmed and tired - ESPECIALLY towards the end of the their terms. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre running a marathon and along the way adapting, absorbing so much information socially, emotionally and mentally. As they get to the week 10 mark, you may find they‚Äôre like we are when we‚Äôre tired- emotional, hungry, cranky, short-fused, you get the gist. LOTS of TLC in those weeks, they are doing their absolute best and it‚Äôs taking everything of them.

The International Criminal Court's founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals, when domestic authorities are ""unwilling or unable"" to do so. On Tuesday, the ICC confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and said it continues to gather information.

instagram,"Feelings do not translate into compatibility. The one has nothing to do with the other. 
Feelings are important. But they do not indicate how well you match.

And you might say that ‚Äúopposites attract‚Äù. Yes, they do. But they do not stay together. Compatible partners stay together. Compatibility gets to be foundation for a healthy and thriving relationship. 
Here is a list that you can look at to find out if you are compatible:

‚ù§Ô∏è Values: Do you have compatible values or are they in conflict?
üíº Commitment: Are your effort more or less equal?
‚≠êÔ∏è Vision: Do you have the same vision for your life and relationship (marriage, kids, location)?
üîí Emotions & safety: Do you feel safe and good with them?
üòè Sexual intimacy: Are you aligned on what you want sexually? Do you have chemistry?
‚ö°Ô∏è Energy level: Is your energy declining or inclining with them?
üó£Ô∏è Communication: Do you communicate effectively? Do you resolve conflicts? Are boundaries in place and respected?

PS: I have just held a free workshop about relationships and I am giving people free access to it. Here is what I talked about in the workshop-

‚≠êÔ∏è A new and empowering perspective on relationships
‚≠êÔ∏è Practical & powerful tools to break free from unhealthy relationship patterns
‚≠êÔ∏è The 7 steps to attracting a healthy relationship
‚≠êÔ∏è Q&A time and more‚Ä¶

instagram,"Playboy magazine has formally severed its professional association with former adult film star Mia Khalifa, citing her recent social media commentary in support of Palestine and Hamas during the Israel-Hamas conflict. Playboy characterized Khalifa's statements as ""disgusting and reprehensible,"" particularly her endorsement of Hamas's actions against Israel.

In an official statement, Playboy reiterated its commitment to open discourse and constructive political dialogue but affirmed a strict stance against hate speech. This move underscores the magazine's dedication to maintaining a space for respectful and diverse perspectives.

The controversy ignited with Khalifa's social media declaration of solidarity with Hamas militants and a call for support for Palestinians. Her use of the apartheid analogy drew significant criticism, and subsequent posts urging Palestinian freedom fighters to document events for historical record further amplified tensions.

Khalifa also engaged with celebrity Kylie Jenner on the issue, questioning Jenner's geopolitical awareness and emphasizing the role of influencers in thoughtful engagement with global affairs. The fallout from Khalifa's posts extended to her business dealings, as Canadian radio personality Todd Shapiro swiftly terminated an impending agreement, condemning Khalifa's tweet as ""horrendous"" and urging her to grow as an individual. These events unfolded against the backdrop of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, with casualties on both sides surpassing 1,600.

instagram,"Death toll in Gaza hits 1,200 with over 338,000 people displaced

The death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to 1,200 people, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Thursday, following an increase in Israeli bombardments on the sixth day since Hamas‚Äôs surprise attack.

‚ÄúThe number of martyrs has risen to around 1,200, and the number of wounded to around 5,600,‚Äù a spokesperson for the health ministry in Gaza said.

More than 338,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip, the United Nations said, as heavy Israeli bombardments continue to hit the Palestinian enclave.

‚ÄúMass displacement across the Gaza Strip continues,‚Äù the UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in a statement sent on Thursday.

By late Wednesday, the number of displaced people in Gaza had risen by an additional 75,000 people from the figure given 24 hours earlier, reaching 338,934, it said.

The announcement came as Israel pounded Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip ‚Äì a densely populated enclave of 2.3 million people ‚Äì in response to the militants‚Äô surprise Saturday attack.

Biden warns Iran not to get involved in conflict

US President Joe Biden warned Iran against getting involved in Israel‚Äôs conflict with Hamas amid fears of a wider regional conflict, while Israeli air strikes around the Gaza Strip drove hundreds of thousands from their homes.

Israeli jets have pounded Gazan targets for days in retribution for a weekend attack by Hamas militants who breached the border fence enclosing the enclave and rampaged through towns and villages, killing 1,200 people, injuring over 2,700, and taking scores of hostages, the Israeli military said.

instagram,"How many times do you feel triggered in your relationship, have an urge to respond habitually in a way that doesn‚Äôt work, recognize the urge and choose to do something new‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but not know what do instead? 
This is a very stuck feeling and definitely adds another layer of anxiety to the situation. 
My intention with this post is to provide you with some new options to work on. As you read through, try to visualize how you might implement these strategies into a familiar conflict between you and your partner. Visualizing can help your brain pathways wire around a new event, even if the new event isn‚Äôt taking place physically. This gives you the opportunity to practice new behaviors and feelings (conjuring up the feeling of empathy, for example) so you‚Äôre better prepared  when tough situations arise.

instagram,"‚ÄºÔ∏èThe ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict has triggered a series of warnings from either side, with the latest being Hamas Commander Mahmoud al-Zahar's radical ambition of dominating the globe.

In a recent viral video, Mahmoud al-Zahar claimed that Israel is merely the initial target and that they aim to extend their influence over the entire world.

""The entire 510 million square kilometers of Planet Earth will come under a system where there is no injustice, no oppression, and no killings and crimes like those being committed against the Palestinians and against the Arabs in all the Arab countries, in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and other countries,"" the Hamas Commander added.

Responding to this, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement asserting his commitment to continue the fight against Hamas, stating that every member of the Palestinian group was ""a dead man"".

""Hamas is Daesh (the Islamic State group), and we will crush them and destroy them as the world has destroyed Daesh,"" he said.

This has been regarded as the placebo effect amid the declaration of war by Israel against Hamas over the horrifying weekend attack in which hundreds of Israelis were killed. 

Further, according to latest updates, more than 1200 people have been killed in Israel and over 2,800 people has been injured. Over 1055 people are killed and 5183 are injured in Gaza.

¬†
We are increasingly concerned by the growing prevalence of online threats, doxxing, and harassment connected to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. We decry any calls for violence in any form or support for terrorism as we continue to mourn the loss of innocent life. We understand this rhetoric is creating deep fear and concern among many members of our campus community. With that in mind, we want to share an extraordinary message, written by two of our faculty, one who is Palestinian and one who is Israeli: ¬†

From: Dr. Hatem Bazian (Lecturer of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures and Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies) and Dr. Ron Hassner (Professor of Israel Studies)

To our students,
¬†
We are two professors on this campus who disagree, vehemently. But we have always treated one another with respect and dignity. We love this campus with its diverse communities and all of our students and are heartbroken to hear of incidents of near violence between students in recent days. We will not tolerate our students harming one another. Disagreement and differing points of view are an essential part of campus life, and we expect that you treat one another with the same respect and dignity that we are modeling here.

instagram,"On that fateful Saturday morning, October 7, our hearts shattered as Hamas terrorists from Gaza ruthlessly invaded nearly two dozen Israeli cities and towns. They left a trail of devastation, massacring and kidnapping unarmed civilians. To this day, the toll is staggering ‚Äì more than 1,100 lives lost, including 14 American citizens, and thousands grievously wounded. It pains me to say that the horrors knew no bounds, with women enduring rape and torture, and innocent babies meeting unfathomable cruelty by being beheaded!!

Among the victims are approximately 150 women, men, children, and even elderly Holocaust survivors who were torn from their homes and held as hostages. The gravity of this situation cannot be overstated.

The kids in these photos have grown up in conflict zones and have only known fear and suffering during their short lives.

It shouldn't be hard to have empathy for everyone who has been victimized in these senseless attacks. 

It shouldn't be hard to acknowledge that both sides are wrong for knowingly and intentionally killing innocent and vulnerable civilians this week.

It shouldn't be hard to show basic human decency. 

Your arguments about why killing kids is a justifiable means to an end and comments that dismiss the death and suffering of those on the sides you do not support have done nothing to garner support for your position. 

They have only served to show your complete and utter disregard for human life.

I hope everyone who has been centering themselves as victims in this situation and demanding attention and support looks at these photos of actual victims and realizes how embarrassing it is to have meltdowns because people are focused on the thousands of people who are dead and injured and in the line of fire instead of giving you sympathy and attention while you watch suffering from the comfort of your home. 

Please spend some time thinking about why you see a tragedy and your first instinct is to exploit other people's suffering as a means to demand attention and sympathy for yourself.

instagram,"After the escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, social media was inundated with misinformation, fake news and false claims, according to reports. Amid the ruckus online, there was also an outpouring of support for Israel, in keeping with India‚Äôs official stance on the conflict. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier posted on X expressing solidarity with Israel. A few celebrities followed suit. As #IndiaWithIsrael trends online, news of the conflict has also sparked vitriolic attacks against Indian Muslims for supporting Palestine. ‚Å†
‚Å†
On X, the conflict seems to have been turned into an opportunity to target Indian Muslims, painting those in support of Palestine as a threat to society, as against humanity, and even stirring up an India-Pakistan rhetoric. One user, who goes by the name The Right Wing Guy, posted, ‚ÄúIndia stands with Israel but Indian Muslims are supporting Palestine‚Ä¶ just because they have their Muslims (sic) brothers there. Is religion above everything?... If Pakistan starts war with India, it means they will support Pakistan because of their brothers.‚Äù Indian actor and producer Kamaal R.

Are you Indian Muslims bigger Muslims than Arabs?‚Äù Some, however, are calling out the attempts to vilify Indian Muslims over the conflict in Israel and Palestine. Dr. Vijendra Singh, an Associate Professor of Law, posted, ‚ÄúThe brutality committed by Israel and its deadly army will be ignored and the brutality committed by Hamas will be used by right wing and godi media to demonise Indian Muslims.

The Biden administration has blasted Donald Trump for heaping praise on the terrorist group Hezbollah, calling the former president‚Äôs statement ‚Äúdangerous and unhinged.‚Äù ‚Å†
‚Å†
During an off-the-rails speech on Wednesday, which also featured Trump blaming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the Hamas conflict, the GOP presidential frontrunner credited Hezbollah over its recent attack on Israel.‚Å†
‚Å†
""They‚Äôre all very smart,"" Trump said.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúStatements like this are dangerous and unhinged,‚Äù White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely lost on us why any American would ever praise an Iran-backed terrorist organization as ‚Äòsmart.‚Äô""‚Å†

instagram,"In 1969, violence broke out in Northern Ireland leading to 30 years of conflict known as the Troubles. Despite the use of the terms Protestant and Catholic to refer to the two sides, the conflict was primarily political rather than religious. Nationalists, who were mostly Irish Catholics, wanted a united Ireland, and loyalists, who were mostly Ulster Protestants, were in favor of Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom. Sectarian lines still divide parts of Northern Ireland today, 24 years after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement largely ended the Troubles.

We will always be there by your side."" 

Blinken acknowledged the Palestinians' ""legitimate aspirations"" while condemning Hamas, emphasizing the need for peace and justice. He shared his personal connection as a Jew and a father, expressing empathy for the lives affected by the conflict.

Blinken's visit aimed to address the complex situation. He affirmed the Biden administration's collaboration with Congress to meet Israel's military needs. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appreciated the US support and called for treating Hamas akin to the Islamic State group, emphasizing the collective effort to counter terrorism.

instagram,"Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has criticized European nations for being too accepting of mass immigration of people of different cultures. Specifically, cultures that now openly cheer on the Hamas attack against Israel. He also warned that soon, European people may find themselves under attack. In an interview with Mathias Dopfner, the CEO of German media group Axel Springer, Kissinger said it was ‚Äòpainful‚Äô seeing Arabs celebrating the death of Jews in the streets of Berlin. ‚ÄòIt was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different cultural and religious concepts because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that,‚Äô he said.

Kissinger, who himself fled persecution for being Jewish, also called for ‚Äòunconditional‚Äô support for Israel, and that there should be a ‚Äòpenalty‚Äô placed on Hamas. However, he warned of the dangers of escalating the situation stating, ‚Äòthe Middle East conflict has the danger of escalating and bringing in other Arab countries under the pressure of their public opinion.‚Äô He also noted that, thanks to mass migration, Europe may find itself part of this conflict whether it likes it or not. ‚ÄòEvery European nation has the same interest because the same attitude might erupt in the direction of Europe,‚Äô he concluded.

instagram,"üö® Egypt Holds Border Closed

Egypt remains firm on not letting Gazans cross the border, wary of getting more involved in the intensifying crisis.

President El-Sisi's Stance

In response to U.S. calls to open borders for civilians escaping Gaza, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi urges Gazans to ""stay steadfast and remain on their land"" as of Thursday.

Pressure Builds

El-Sisi insists Egypt won't take on Israel's conflict, but the country faces growing calls to provide a way out for Gaza's trapped 2.3 million residents.

Hostage Situation
Hundreds of hostages, including some Americans, remain held in Gaza, complicating efforts to neutralize terrorists without harming civilians.

Human Shield Tactics

Gazans continue to use civilians as human shields, making it challenging for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to act without causing collateral damage.

Missing Solution

I do not want my page to be a place of hate. Folks on here in pain devaluing Palestinian life: NO. Folks on here in pain devaluing Jewish life: NO. 

2.
Propaganda is everywhere & it‚Äôs important we all check the sh*t out of what we share. This video exists & is real. The verbiage he uses is real. Headlines may differ but his speech says what it says. Anyone who says this is a call for peaceful protest when he‚Äôs urging everyone around the world to engage in jihad is really deluded. It‚Äôs quite astonishing that there are things like, say for example, many legit reporters speaking on camera as they discover bodies of children & what state they‚Äôre in, & then people take to the internet to say these are fabricated, the r*pes are false, the beheadings aren‚Äôt real. I wish they were not real. Maybe folks don‚Äôt want to believe it, maybe they‚Äôre so used to saying Jewish suffering is over exaggerated, maybe they‚Äôre just so attached to their ‚Äúposition‚Äù that they can‚Äôt even engage in the truth. Autopsy‚Äôs don‚Äôt lie. In the end, what is done to the people who‚Äôs lives will be lost to this conflict will be logged and archived forever on all sides.

instagram,"New Delhi: The Israeli human rights group B‚ÄôTselem has accused Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza and condemned its military response to Hamas ‚Äì calling it ‚Äúa criminal policy of revenge.‚Äù

The nonprofit organisation, based in Jerusalem, strives to document Israeli human rights violations and end Israeli occupation. In its statement Tuesday, B‚ÄôTselem said, ‚ÄúHundreds of homes already lie in ruins, including residential towers reduced to rubble and houses that collapsed on top of inhabitants.‚Äù

Since the deadly Hamas attacks in Israel on Saturday, Israeli officials have expressed a position of forceful retaliation. Tuesday morning, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari said ‚Äúhundreds of tons of bombs‚Äù have been dropped on the Gaza Strip already and that ‚Äúthe emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy.‚Äù

Haaretz reported the death toll in Israel rose to 1,200 killed and 2,400 wounded on Wednesday, day five of the Israel-Hamas conflict. In Palestine, Haaretz said 950 have been killed and 5,000 wounded.

instagram,"GATHERING her thoughts over the last number of days and feeling the pressure to have an opinion on everything by social media users, local woman Cliona Fentlan has made a historic breakthrough which could help millions of irate internet users everywhere.

‚ÄúI dunno, I just sort of used my critical faculties and next thing I know I‚Äôm calling the pure evil actions of Hamas abhorrent and indefensible, and then I was able to conclude that starving innocent people of access to food, water and fuel while bombing civilians is a war crime,‚Äù explained Fentlan, believed to be one of a handful of people with no trouble condemning both Hamas and the Israeli state.

‚ÄúI was sort of on a roll then and I was thinking it is wrong and unhelpful to tarnish all Palestinians with the Hamas brush while failing to see how anyone can react joyously to Hamas‚Äô vile actions,‚Äù added Fentlan, admittedly surprised by the clarity of her thoughts and how quickly they formed in her head.

Crucially it was Fentlan‚Äôs ability to do all this in private and within the confines of her mind and not subject social media to her bloviating that has won her praise from experts everywhere.

‚ÄúIt is beyond my comprehension to fathom what Hamas has done but it‚Äôs not beyond my comprehension to avoid thinking this does not give the Israeli government permission to yet again disregard international law and perpetrate their own inexcusable crimes on defenceless civilians,‚Äù concluded Fentlan, who had the humility to admit she knows as much as the next clueless eejit.

Originally believed to be a sloth ü¶•, sloth bears are one of the eight bear species in the world. Unfortunately, the sloth bear population has dropped by 40 to 50% over the last three decades, mainly due to habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, poaching and increasing human-bear conflict. To draw attention to the conservation and protection of this unique bear species, @wildlifesos, in collaboration with the IUCN-SSC Sloth bear expert team, declared 12th October as World Sloth Bear Day. You can help sloth bears by posting and raising awareness about sloth bears.

instagram,"Israel has cut off electricity and water for Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons, in an apparent step to prevent them from aiding the conflict between occupation forces and Palestinian resistance fighters on the outside.

According to Israel‚Äôs Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, which cited senior officials in the country‚Äôs Prison Service, ‚Äúelectricity has been cut off for all Palestinian prisoners‚Äù in order to block all access to media and means of communication by the prisoners who would otherwise apparently potentially deliver guidance or instructions to the Palestinian resistance fighters currently battling Israeli forces.

The decision to suspend the prisoners‚Äô power supply was reportedly issued by Prison Service Commissioner, Katy Perry, who also ordered on Saturday that a lockdown be imposed on all Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails and to confine them to their cells.

According to the Palestinian Prisoner‚Äôs Club, however, it was not just electricity that has been suspended and withdrawn from the detainees, but also their water supply. ‚ÄúMore than 5,250 Palestinian prisoners are facing the risk of a real disaster in Israeli prisons after the Israeli occupation‚Äôs decision to cut off electricity and water in the prisons,‚Äù the Club was quoted as saying.

The Israeli prison authorities‚Äô move comes amid the government‚Äôs wider tactic of imposing a total siege on the Gaza Strip and cutting off all electricity, water, food, fuel and aid supplies to the Territory as the Occupation‚Äôs military carries out a brutal bombing and airstrike campaign on Hamas and Gaza‚Äôs civilian population.

Out of the 5250 prisoners, there are reportedly 39 female prisoners  and over 170 children amongst them, making the risk they face far more severe.

instagram,"White House spokesperson turns down President Biden's claim of seeing images of mutil.ated children during a meeting with Jewish leaders, stating that he had never expected to see such confirmed pictures of terro.rists be.head.ing children. 

‚ÄúI never really thought that I would see, have confirmed, pictures of terro.rists be.head.ing children,‚Äù said Biden earlier on Saturday.

White House representative clarified that the comments by the President were based on news reports and claims by Israeli officials. 

‚ÄúA White House spokesperson later clarified that US officials and the president have not seen pictures or confirmed such reports independently,‚Äù reported The Washington Post.

‚ÄúThe president based his comments about the alleged atro.cities on the claims from Netanyahu‚Äôs spokesman and media reports from Israel, according to the White House.‚Äù

The unverified claims about be.head.ed Israeli children and s*xual assaults had gone viral on social media but had not been confirmed. The Israeli army also expressed an inability to confirm these claims, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesperson reiterated the allegations. Meanwhile, Hamas vehemently denied these accusations.

This situation highlights the challenges of misinformation and false information circulating on social media platforms during the Israel-Hamas conflict and highlights the pressing need for accurate and verified information in such sensitive matters.

I stand with all the innocent men, women and children who are harmed by what governments and ruling militias do to further their agendas. I condemn the atrocities inflected to innocent Israeli souls. I condemn the ongoing inhumane conditions Palestinians have been forced to live in for decades. Hamas is a terrorist organization committing the most heinous crimes we could possibly imagine. No harming of any human being is ever justifiable. Let‚Äôs look beyond the propaganda, the corrupt governments and the war industry that disgustingly profits from continually dividing humanity, for more power and greed. If you think we have to ‚Äúchoose a side‚Äù you let them win.
Our best response is to unite, to truly love one another no matter what. I stand for peace, for human rights and for denouncing terror for the world to finally end this violence. It‚Äôs hard to voice an opinion because this crisis is so complex, nuanced and hard to understand, we are afraid to say the wrong thing. (And I probably will, Forgive me!) I‚Äôm not a politician, I‚Äôm not an historian or an expert on this conflict. But I believe we can and must always use our voices to denounce terrorism and the senseless murder of civilians. I can not and will not stay silent while my friends are getting murdered. 
Meanwhile, everyone processes things in their own time so growling at people about why they are not saying anything might not be the most efficient. Give people the time to inform themselves to understand the full scope of what‚Äôs happening and why. Compassion for every human being as they are simply another facet of our own consciousness. This world is a mirror, whatever harm you cause to someone you will experience in return. Whatever love you give you will receive. Love is the answer! Let this be our time to unite ‚ô•Ô∏è

instagram,"Holding grief for many things at once, even things that feel at odds, is incredibly human.
I would argue that these things are not at odds, though. Grief about mass killings‚Äì of Palestinians, Israelis, anyone from anywhere‚Äì does not conflict with grief for a people imprisoned in their homeland, surveilled, rationed, attacked and murdered by their oppressors.

We must make it starkly clear: this is not only a non-contradictory stance, but a deeply, painfully, righteously human one.
Be unwavering in your commitment to pacifism and anti-militarism and equally dedicated to fighting oppression, apartheid, and all forms of injustice.

If you shed tears only when Israelis die, ask why innocent Palestinians should suffer for that. If you revel in the deaths of civilians living in an imperialist settler state, ask what choice it was of yours where you were born (especially if you‚Äôre an American like me). Some of those people chose to move there and expressly evict Palestinians from their homes‚Äì inexcusable settler violence! Mass slaughter of civilians, also inexcusable! The actions of Hamas have been horrific and brutal. So too have been the actions of the Israeli state for nearly a century. Contextualizing Hamas‚Äôs violence in decades of oppression and ethnic cleansing is not apologizing for said violence, but necessary to understanding the conflict‚Äôs root: the occupation.

It‚Äôs 10000000:1. Israel, backed by nearly the entire world (incl. $3B+ ANNUALLY from the US), has expressed an explicit intention to massacre Gaza, calling Palestinians ‚Äúhuman animals‚Äù. They have already cut off all basic necessary resources to 2.4M Gazans.
This is genocide and the US is complicit.

At least 11 United Nations staff and personnel, as well as 30 students at UN schools have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.

UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, ‚Äú11 United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) staff and personnel have been killed since Saturday‚Äù, referring to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees which also runs schools in Gaza.

‚Äú30 UNRWA students have also been killed and another eight have been injured,‚Äù she said.

The victims include five teachers, a gynaecologist, an engineer, a counsellor and three support staff, UNRWA‚Äôs deputy director Jennifer Austin said in a statement.

She further said, ‚ÄúUNRWA mourns this loss and is grieving with our colleagues and the families. UN staff and civilians must be protected at all times during conflict. We call for the fighting to come to an end to spare more civilian lives lost.‚Äù

Reportedly, over 250,000 people in Gaza have fled from their homes, the UN said.

instagram,"Despite international journalists and news agencies debunking allegations that Palestinian resistance group Hamas ‚Äúbeheaded babies‚Äù in Israel, the claim continues to make headlines in Israeli, Western and Indian media, receiving millions of social media views.

Even as thousands of people have been killed in the conflict between the Israeli army and Gaza-based Hamas‚Äô armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, the disinformation front of the conflict persists on social media.

Israeli news channel i24 alleged on Tuesday that the Qassam Brigades, ‚Äúbeheaded many Israeli babies‚Äù during Saturday‚Äôs attack.

But when Anadolu Agency contacted the Israeli military over the phone to ask about the claims, their spokesperson unit said: ‚ÄúWe have seen the news, but we do not have any details or confirmation about that.‚Äù

Right-wing news channel Republic, with a correspondent in Israel, published a report titled ‚ÄúDisturbing information comes to light, suggesting Hamas beheaded babies.‚Äù It reported that Israeli soldiers and media had discovered ‚Äúbodies of babies with their heads cut off.‚Äù

NDTV republished a report from ANI, citing i24 News as its source, which stated: ‚ÄúIn one of the blood-curdling details from the Hamas attack on Israel, at least 40 babies were killed by the terror group‚Ä¶‚Äù Soldiers ‚Äúarrived already expecting the worst, but the scenes were beyond imagination.‚Äù

The Times of India reported that Israeli officials and journalists ‚Äúwere left in shock as Hamas terrorists brutally killed 40 babies.‚Äù

Times Now‚Äôs website featured a report with the headline ‚ÄúIsrael-Hamas war horror: 40 babies killed by militants, some beheaded.‚Äù

Hindutva websites Swarajya and OpIndia picked up the story from i24 News.

Several Hindu nationalist journalists, including TV9 Network executive editor Aditya Raj Kaul and Sudarshan News‚Äô Suresh Chahvanke, shared this false information on X.

Fact-checkers and Muslim activists have pointed out that even some ‚Äòliberal journalists‚Äô critical of India‚Äôs right-wing also propagated this false information. Prominent journalists such as Barkha Dutt and award-winning journalist Rohini Singh were among those who shared this news on X.",,2037,"{'like_count': 1933, 'comment_count': 104, 'num_users': 83329}",Maktoob,,2023-10-12 07:44:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/41945314_1868111699892216_2488523816741896192_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KIF79oWdMPMAX9JG0N4&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDYWpOqFT2TdO6djwyTuftssq0hXUWQQLK0ORPxyputCA&oe=6559C446,https://www.instagram.com/p/CySnQgAPp23/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387684603_6932455703441711_2059004720428505823_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=hD-Mp2W41iYAX_aJL0F&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCl_yk5W4OS6yAFyrkrOcgx2iyPxaHdYeoBP1v6dcL9yQ&oe=6531D098
instagram,"The attack by Hamas in recent days arrived just as it seemed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was about to complete his masterpiece: peace with the Arab world while completely ignoring the Palestinians. 

This attack has reminded Israelis and the world, for better or for worse, that the Palestinians are still here, and that the century-old conflict here involves them, not the Emiratis or the Saudis.

Since he was first elected prime minister in 1996, Netanyahu has tried to avoid any negotiations with the Palestinian leadership, instead choosing to bypass it and push it aside. Israel does not need peace with the Palestinians to prosper, Netanyahu repeatedly claimed; its military, economic, and political strength is sufficient without it. 

The Abraham Accords signed with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, and later also Sudan and Morocco, reinforced this belief conclusively.

On Saturday morning, the Gaza fence was torn down, and with it the broader Netanyahu doctrine - adopted by the Americans and many Arab states - that it is possible to make peace in the Middle East without the Palestinians.

As hundreds of militants crossed the border unhindered on their way to occupy army posts and infiltrate dozens of Israeli communities as far as 18 miles away, Hamas declared in the most clear, painful, and murderous way possible that the conflict that threatens Israelis' lives is the conflict with the Palestinians, and the idea that they can be bypassed via Riyadh or Abu Dhabi, or that the 2 million Palestinians imprisoned in Gaza will disappear if Israel builds a sufficiently elaborate fence, is an illusion that is now being shattered at a terrible human cost.

instagram,"The African Tribe reinterpreting Victorian Era garments from the 1900sü™°

Meet the Herero, a people who live mostly in Namibia, Africa

But why would an African tribe wear traditionally Western clothes? If you have some sense of African history, the answer may not come as a great surprise: in short, it has to do with a painful colonial experience:

During the 20th century, Namibia used to be a German colony. Around the year 1900, a severe conflict broke out between the Germans and the Herero.
Women took up foreign dresses, modifying them to appear somewhat like the cattle (an important part of Herero society).
The men claimed the military uniform of the dead bodies of German soldiers.

Today, the military dress is a tribute to these struggles.

During these battles, Herero population was reduced by nearly 80%. 

‚ÄúThe dresses and uniforms are extremely important and powerful symbols of Herero culture, and here is the paradox, as the clothing comes from (or is directly influenced by) the people who nearly wiped them out altogether.‚Äù - Jim Naughten

instagram,"I was a Nay on the Ohio House Resolution on Israel. 
It was not an easy decision to make. No one wants to vote against a resolution condemning violence. But this resolution fell short of what it should have been. To condemn terror but to not erase the damage and destruction endured by the Palestinian people. I could not vote ‚ÄòYes‚Äô and ignore my Palestinian friends and neighbors who for too long had very few stand for them. 
I still strongly pray for the Jewish lives lost and mourn with my Jewish friends and neighbors as they live through this devastating moment. 

But as my friend @daniisaacsohn said: ‚ÄúIt is not moral equivalence to mourn the loss of all innocent lives including those in Gaza‚Äù

I cannot in good conscience sit and vote yes on a resolution that does not ask for a de-escalation of violent retribution launched by Israel against largely civilian territory. 

The Palestinian children also deserve someone to stand up for them and condemn their murder. Those babies who right now are denied water, electricity and medicine, deserve to have someone stand up for them and condemn their abuse. An abuse they have suffered for over 75 years. With over 6,000 Palestinian lives lost since 2008 and thousands more injured and displaced

I stand with the Palestinians who for too long have been ignored, demonized, dehumanized, and refused the dignity and humanity all humans deserve.

I stand with Israelis who have called out the inhumanity of the apartheid state and have called for full rights and safety for all citizens of Israel and Palestine. 

It is time to call for true justice and apply the values of universal human rights to all victims of oppression, regardless of nationality, religion or skin color. 
I send my prayers for peace and the protection of innocent lives lost during this conflict. Be it Israeli, Palestinian, American or any other loss of life. 

Israeli writer Gideon Levy stated:
‚ÄúWe now have to cry bitterly for the Israeli victims, but we should also cry for Gaza""

instagram,"‚úçÔ∏è @jeremycorbyn ‚ÄúI Condemn Violence Against All Civilians, Why Can‚Äôt Keir Starmer?‚Äù

In an interview with LBC, Keir Starmer was asked whether ‚Äúcutting off power and water‚Äù to 2 million people, half of whom are children, was appropriate. He agreed that Israel ‚Äúhas that right‚Äù. Where is the empathy for Palestinians who have lost their loved ones, their homes and their futures? What happened to the universal application of international law?

We may be witnessing the beginning of the total annihilation of Gaza and its people. This is not a battle between one state and another. It is couched as an Israeli response to a non-state actor, but in fact it is a response to Palestinian people wherever they are. What is unfolding is not a conflict of equals, but the systematic starvation, subjugation and destruction of an unarmed civilian population.

I wonder, if Gaza is wiped off the face of the earth, whether our politicians will look back and reflect on the reality of their unwavering support. If they had any integrity, they would mourn the innocent Palestinian lives that have been erased in the name of self-defence. They should be ashamed of their cowardice, knowing that others will pay the price for the war crimes they refuse to oppose.

We should condemn the targeting of all civilian life, no matter who does it. That this is apparently controversial is testament to the depravity of a media and political class that shuts down, distorts and denounces calls for peace. The heinous attacks on civilians in Israel by Hamas were utterly deplorable.

This cannot justify the indiscriminate killing of Palestinians, who are paying a price for a crime they did not commit. All human life is equal. Why is it so difficult for our politicians to be consistent in this basic moral principle?

Did you know? The sloth bear population has dropped by 40-50% over the last three decades, mainly due to habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, poaching, and increasing human-bear conflict.

To draw attention to the conservation and protection of this unique bear species, Wildlife SOS, in collaboration with the International Union For Conservation of Nature's sloth bear expert team, declared October 12 as World Sloth Bear Day.

You can become a part of this day by posting and raising awareness about sloth bears. Be sure to visit the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium today to learn more about our sloth bears! #WorldSlothBearDay

instagram,"A university student abducted by the terror outfit Hamas from a music festival held in the southern part of Israel on October 7, has her birthday today. The state of Israel, through its official social media handles, greeted 26-year-old Noa Argamani with birthday wishes. 

The video of Noa's abduction by Hamas fighters took the internet by storm. Footage showed Noa yelling for aid, her arm outstretched, as she was taken away on a motorcycle. Noa, an Israeli citizen, was attending the Supernova Music Festival, an all-night rave near Kibbutz Re'im on the Gaza border.

Coupled with a barrage of rockets, Hamas fighters opened fire at the spot. A total of 260 bodies were recovered from the desert area, a report by a news agency suggested, quoting Israeli rescue service Zaka. Many on the internet drew parallels between the incident and the Auschwitz Holocaust, in which thousands of Jews died in over 40 concentration camps during World War II. 

Many even went on to describe it as the ‚ÄúSupernova Music Festival massacre."" The 26-year-old Israeli was last seen in the disturbing video. Following the full-blown war between Israel and Hamas, the former‚Äôs social media had been filled with stories of Israelis facing the brunt of conflict. Noa is untraceable, and her parents told CBS News that they want the Israeli establishment to bring her back using ""peaceful measures.""

While sharing a picture of Noa on X, the State of Israel greeted her with birthday wishes. ‚ÄúThis beautiful woman is named Noa. She was taken hostage by Hamas during a music festival. Today is her 26th birthday,‚Äù the post read.

The Israeli state‚Äôs post further informed that her parents want people to wish Noa a happy birthday. Her parents were hopeful that if people wished their daughter on her birthday, the news might reach out to her.

Notably, Noa is among hundreds of Israeli citizens abducted by the Palestinian militant group since the outbreak of war over the weekend.

Due to its proximity to the conflict, Egypt will inevitably become involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This raises concerns about whether or not Egypt would open its borders to allow Palestinians in Gaza to flee.‚Å†

Without belief in the cause, some may fade, becoming mere shadows amidst the chaos. But you? With unwavering faith and purpose, you have the potential to become a legend.

The military operation, which involves extensive bombing of residences, follows a surprise attack on 7 October, 2023, by Hamas militants who infiltrated Israel from Gaza and killed more than 900 Israelis. In reprisal airstrikes, the Israel military has killed over 800 Gazans. And that figure could escalate in the coming days. Meanwhile, an order to cut off all food, electricity and water to Gaza will only worsen the plight of residents in what has been called the ""world's largest open-air prison"".

Despite concerning events in the past days, the situation in UNIFIL‚Äôs area of operations remains stable, but volatile. Exchanges of fire between Lebanese territory and Israel have fortunately not escalated into conflict.

Our peacekeepers remain in their positions and on task. We have increased patrols and other activities to maintain stability, coordinating this work with the Lebanese Armed Forces. We have actively engaged with authorities on both sides of the Blue Line to de-escalate the situation and avoid misunderstandings.

Peacekeepers continue their essential work.

Our main goal is to help avoid confrontation between Lebanon and Israel, and any event that brings conflict closer is a concern. We are working 24/7 to ensure this does not happen.

instagram,"I made the caption from my previous post into a slide series to share. These are practices I‚Äôve outlined in detail in my book Raising Critical Thinkers. Thanks for your thoughtful interest in these ideas. I especially thank you for sharing with others. I wrote my book because I believe critical thinking is the key skill we desperately need today in all our educating and discourse. üôèüèº
‚Äî
[images: Here‚Äôs how I process wildly traumatic and shocking news.

I begin by reading. I do my best to start with ‚Äúnot knowing.‚Äù I know my feelings, but I don‚Äôt know the full story. I give myself permission to not know how to interpret the news even while I read it and watch it. I notice my knee-jerk reaction to the barrage of opinions we hurl at one another‚Äîthe pressure to say the right thing, to avoid the wrong thing. I discover how I lean and I get curious about why. I wonder about how someone I respect sees the same information so differently from another person I respect.

Then I read all the perspectives I can that make me the most uncomfortable. I try to imagine more perspectives than the one I automatically adopt. I add the grief of as many parties as I can hold. I list in my mind the questions I can‚Äôt answer easily. I feel my feelings: revulsed, hopeless, angry, shocked, defeated, frightened.

I don‚Äôt assume I am getting the full story from any one source. I know that reading and media cannot tell me what I haven‚Äôt lived. My perspective will always be one of learner, not expert. I lean on my values. I reject brutality in all its forms as a means of getting what one wants or justifies.

I even have beliefs I‚Äôve worked on for decades, patiently, with some care. I don‚Äôt have solutions. I have an incomplete picture with a lot of questions. I always want to know more. And I grieve with the suffering‚Äîvictims in a conflict they would not choose for themselves.]",,1360,"{'like_count': 1318, 'comment_count': 42, 'num_users': 119116}",Julie Sweeney,,2023-10-12 14:40:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/379102363_289034713882033_2448540794658384029_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=meDCIE4etbYAX_PKvIm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfByduwx88oP7wdFRrxCDdueF8iGe2wGkBtnd3fneRg_LQ&oe=655B18FE,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTW1t8rpFc/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387726041_799332541968372_7543487541624037789_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=V1WAowwnTLcAX8xW2Le&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDOHOt9hf42UG63dwTpYYuxJgjSrsuHhmbQWBJqYVUQFw&oe=6558E73A

Details: Activist and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, in a statement posted on X, she began by advocating for an urgent ceasefire in the region, expressing her concern for the children caught amid the conflict on both sides.

More: Reflecting on her childhood experiences in a conflict zone, Malala shared memories of violence and terrorism that she witnessed when she was just 11 years old. She described the grim reality of waking up to the sounds of mortar shells and seeing schools and mosques destroyed by bombs, highlighting how the pursuit of peace became a distant dream.

Also: Malala emphasized that war does not spare children, whether kidnapped from their homes in Israel or hiding from airstrikes without access to food and water in Gaza. She expressed her grief for all the children and individuals yearning for peace and justice in the Holy Land.

instagram,"Pray for Israel üáÆüá±
As we witness the ongoing conflict and turmoil in Israel, we want to take a moment to remind you to PRAY for the people of Israel during these uncertain and dire times. Here are some things we can all pray together for:

‚Ä¢ Peace: That the conflict comes to an end.
‚Ä¢ Protection: For God's protective hand to watch over Israel.
‚Ä¢ Strength: To carry them through these impossible times.
‚Ä¢ Wisdom: For the leaders making difficult decisions.
‚Ä¢ Hope: May hope shine brighter, even in the darkest moments.

As believers we know the power of prayer. So, let‚Äôs pray and be a community of hope, unity, and support.

üìñ¬†¬†And as we do this, let's remember Psalm 122:6-9

""Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: 'May those who love you be secure. May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.' For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, 'Peace be within you.' For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your prosperity.""

We hope you will share this post and encourage others to pray!

instagram,"Frustrated with celebrities, psychologists, self help or wellness gurus, and lifestyle influencers who use ‚Äúterrorists/terrorism‚Äù in their posts. 

Stop using these ‚Äúpolitically violent‚Äù terms, they are used to bomb civilians. 

Israel says it has dropped 6000 retaliatory bombs on Gaza in the last 6 days. 

Tens of thousands of homes are now rubble, 1 in 5 Gazans have lost their homes, according to the UN. 

Over 1400, hundreds of children, and 12 UN workers have been killed. 

All of this has happened largely because world leaders and too many people accept Israel‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúterrorism.‚Äù

Especially frustrated with folks who talk deeply about healing and generational trauma for themselves but thoughtlessly use ‚Äúterrorism or terrorist‚Äù, which has historically been used as a violent political tool to dehumanize and kill brown and black people and folks fighting imperial or colonial powers. 

Don‚Äôt use terms you don‚Äôt understand when commenting on a complicated war, conflict or occupation. 

Your uninformed opinions help justify dropping bombs on women and children. 

‚ÄúTerrorism/terrorist‚Äù are political terms used by powerful governments to justify bombing separatist movements, resistance or militant groups living in civilian populations. If you‚Äôre an influencer or celebrity and don‚Äôt know this, please start researching and paying attention to the wars or resistance movements of the last century, because they legit paved your way to freedom and voting rights and the fact that your current ‚Äúwoke‚Äù takes can be popularly accepted by your audiences and brands.

instagram,"De media lijkt voortdurend informatie te selecteren en te negeren. Ze presenteren een eenzijdig beeld van het Isra√´lisch-Palestijnse conflict, waarbij de nadruk ligt op Isra√´l. Dit cre√´ert de perceptie dat Isra√´l het slachtoffer is, terwijl de Palestijnen dat al 75 jaar zijn. 

Isra√´l is bezig met voortdurende  onderdrukking op Palestina, terwijl ze de Palestijnen zelf als terroristen bestempelen. Dit lijkt te wijten aan de voorkeur van de westerse media voor de Isra√´lische kant, die vaak wordt be√Ønvloed door de Amerikaanse positie, en dit narratief wordt gevolgd door het westen

instagram,"When Rome lit up a landmark this week in blue and white following Hamas‚Äô deadly invasion of Israel, it joined many other cities and countries across the globe that have bathed their most prominent buildings in the colors of the Israeli flag, including the White House, the Eiffel Tower and the Sydney Opera House.‚Å†
‚Å†
The landmark Rome chose, however, isn‚Äôt its most iconic building, nor its biggest. But it does hold a special resonance for Jews.‚Å†
‚Å†
The Arch of Titus, in the city‚Äôs historic center, was built nearly 2,000 years ago to celebrate the eponymous Roman general‚Äôs conquering of Jerusalem and destruction of its Holy Temple. Erected about eight years after the conflict, it shows the soon-to-be emperor leading a procession of Roman soldiers and captured Jews bearing the spoils of the temple, including its menorah.‚Å†
‚Å†

instagram,"Airstrikes continue in Gaza

Smoke plumes billow during Israeli air strikes in Gaza City on October 12, 2023 as raging battles between Israel and the Hamas movement continue for the sixth consecutive day. Washington urged Israel to show restraint in its response to Hamas' surprise attack -- the worst in the country's 75-year history -- which Israeli forces said killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians. In Gaza, officials have reported more than 1,200 people killed in Israel's uninterrupted campaign of air and artillery strikes, while the UN said more than 338,000 people have been displaced.

instagram,"South Korea is finding itself in a difficult position as the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas escalates further. President Yoon Suk Yeol has condemned Hamas' ""indiscriminate"" attacks, yet he has not openly expressed support for Israel, in what is viewed as a balancing act amid fears that the ongoing war may expand to a wider Middle East conflict.

During a meeting between Yoon and a six-member U.S. bipartisan Senate delegation led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer during the latter's visit to Seoul, Wednesday, Schumer urged the South Korean government to stand with Washington in supporting Israel. ""I urged President Yoon to continue to stand with the Israeli people and do all he can to join the U.S. by supporting Israel‚Äôs effort to defend itself. I described the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists,"" Schumer wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Thursday. ""I saw he was moved and affirmed South Korea‚Äôs commitment to Israel‚Äôs security,"" he added.

But an official statement released by Yoon's office on the meeting with the U.S. Senate delegation did not mention South Korea's commitment to Israel's security. ""The president and the Senate delegation condemned Hamas' indiscriminate attacks on Israel and expressed their empathy for the need for South Korea and the U.S. to play a constructive role in bringing a swift end to the current situation, easing tensions in the region and achieving stability,"" read the statement released by the presidential office on Wednesday evening.

The somewhat differing tone between the top U.S. senator and the South Korean presidential office suggests that Seoul is trying to maintain a diplomatic balance in the decades-long Israel-Palestine strife, one of the world's most intractable conflicts.

instagram,"The assault and dastardly attack on dog feeders is deplorable and deeply disturbing. Dog feeders do a wonderful service to society because they help create friendlier dogs who are calm, instead of starving, and who will not bite and are easier to catch for sterilisation and vaccination. 

It is the statutory responsibility of every housing society to designate feeding spots for community animals in consultation with the caregivers/dog feeders, as per the mandate under Rule 20 of the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023. This will also help reduce man animal conflict, cases of dog bites, etc.

Rule 20(2) of the ABC Rules, 2023 clearly states that in case of any conflict between the housing society and the animal caregivers or other residents, an animal welfare committee shall be formed. 

The Bombay High Court, recently, on 24 April 2023 in Vineeta Tandon vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors reiterated that the ABC Rules, 2023 have the force of law & it is not open to any housing society to say it will not abide by the law.

üèÜ It‚Äôs a game-changer. 
üíì A heart-expander. 
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π And a cathartic, evolutionarily healing practice. 

Learning this skill helps us heal ourselves, our romantic partnerships, our relationships with our children, parents, coworkers‚Ä¶

Committing to this path allows us to be healthy, whole, loving, and lovable human beings. 

üí¢ Conflict in relationships isn't just common -- it's inevitable. It's up to us if we take the opportunity we have to do conflict differently.

Here‚Äôs what one participant recently said about the impact The Art of Rupture & Repair has had on her relationship:

‚ÄúWe had a rupture the other day. Normally, I‚Äôd shut down, get pissed, make plans in my head for leaving the relationship... This time, I allowed myself to do something different. I got vulnerable, followed the prompts, regulated my nervous system, and went from fearing the worst, to actually feeling‚Ä¶ better. I can‚Äôt believe how effective it is, and how much better‚Äì‚Äìjuicier, healthier, and more regenerative‚Äì‚Äìour partnership feels with this practice at hand.‚Äù

instagram,"Opinion | Anand Vardhan writes:

The early days of the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas has expectedly seen fierce fighting and aerial strikes. And as the conflict rages on in the Middle East, India‚Äôs initial response has been a clear expression of New Delhi‚Äôs solidarity with the people of Israel as victims of the attack by Hamas last Saturday. 

This could be seen in  Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs first reaction to the attacks, and later the assurance the PM gave to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu about India‚Äôs stand when they discussed it on the phone earlier this week. At the same time, the ministry of external affairs hasn‚Äôt yet issued an official statement on how India is viewing the attacks and the ongoing war.

There is also talk of differences between how the BJP-led central government and the principal opposition party Congress have drafted their responses.

instagram,"On 4 August, the Germans launched an offensive by using the 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. The attack was supported by intense Luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The battle degenerated into¬†house-to-house fighting¬†as both sides poured reinforcements into the city.

Follow @faces_of_ww1

German tactics followed a successful pattern:¬†Luftwaffe airstrikes, then artillery, then advancing infantry with tanks in support. Unfortunately there were never enough artillery, infantry, and tanks to do the job swiftly and although the pattern was effective it still came with a high cost in casualties.

Soviet and Russian tactics specified that¬†tanks would lead the assault in city fighting followed by infantry fighting vehicles and dismounted infantry. Tank columns would move in herringbone formation along city streets.

Stalingrad was the first great extended urban conflict in the history of modern warfare, and¬†functionaries on both sides came to resemble close-quarter hit-and-run guerrillas.

instagram,"What is Israel‚Äôs role in the end times? It's a common question this week! Here's the answer: ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Every time there is a conflict in or around Israel, many see it as a sign of the quickly approaching end times. The problem with this is that we may eventually tire of the conflict in Israel, so much so that we will not recognize when true, prophetically significant events occur. Conflict in Israel is not necessarily a sign of the end times.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Conflict in Israel has been a reality whenever Israel has existed as a nation. Whether it was the Egyptians, Amalekites, Midianites, Moabites, Ammonites, Amorites, Philistines, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, or Romans, the nation of Israel has always been persecuted by its neighbors. Why is this? According to the Bible, it is because God has a special plan for the nation of Israel, and Satan wants to defeat that plan. Satanically influenced hatred of Israel‚Äîand especially Israel‚Äôs God‚Äîis the reason Israel‚Äôs neighbors have always wanted to see Israel destroyed. Whether it is Sennacherib, king of Assyria; Haman, official of Persia; Hitler, leader of Nazi Germany; or Rouhani, President of Iran, attempts to completely destroy Israel will always fail. The persecutors of Israel will come and go, but the persecution will remain until the second coming of Christ. As a result, conflict in Israel is not a reliable indicator of the soon arrival of the end times.‚†Ä

instagram,"In continuation of last post,

By the end of the Korean War, the F-86 was credited for shooting down 792 MiGs, at the loss of only 78 Sabres. It's important to note that this is not an accurate representation of the MiGs capability compared to the Sabre, as many Sabre pilots were experienced WWII veterans, competing against largely inexperienced Chinese and Korean pilots. During the conflict, 41 pilots achieved Ace status, 40 of which flew the Sabre, the exception being a navy F4U night fighter pilot. It is argued that Sabre‚Äôs only downed around 200 MiGs, after an internal investigation for more accurate numbers. On the opposite side of the conflict, Soviet and Chinese records claim over 800 sabres shot down, which cannot be reconciled by US records. So it‚Äôs impossible to find an accurate number of Sabre VS MiG ratios.¬†

During the conflict, the Soviets managed to capture one single example of an F-86, that had avoided destruction by USAF crew, after it crash landed on a beach, before being submerged. The Soviet‚Äôs were able to recover a US G-suit, and the radar gun sight as well. The gun sight would be reproduced as the ASP-4N gunsight, and would be installed on the MiG-17, that would later be used during the Vietnam War.¬†

The Sabre would be used in numerous conflicts, and in multiple militaries during its service, playing a critical role in aviation history.¬†

instagram,"From my book: Ever heard of the Qana massacre ? The UN is saying today  that airstrikes in Gaza are directly hitting its shelters and have damaged five other schools-turned-shelters. Israel claims to be hitting Hamas military targets and locations. This makes me think of our own history in Lebanon. One moment in our collective memoire that has traumatized me as a child and which I briefly mention in the introduction of my book ALL SHE LOST: In 1996, Israel launched its ‚ÄúGrapes of Wrath‚Äù operation on the south of Lebanon , which it was occupying at the time. On April 18, 1996 the IDF shelled a UN shelter near the village of Qana - where at least 800 people were taking refuge. 106 people are killed, half of them are children. Israel claimed that there were close Hezbollah targets to the UN compound - but a UN investigation found that the Israeli attack on the base ‚Äúwas likely not an accident,‚Äù and an Amnesty International investigation concluded that it was intentional. War crimes have been committed by Israel many times in the history of this conflict and with NO accountability. The vicious cycle of violence will only make everyone worse off especially the innocent civilians of Gaza. No one will be safe on the long run if the root cause of the problem- that is occupation and what humanitarian and human rights organizations have called Apartheid - is not resolved.",,982,"{'like_count': 959, 'comment_count': 23, 'num_users': 39212}",Dalal Mawad ÿØŸÑÿßŸÑ ŸÖÿπŸàÿ∂,,2023-10-12 11:37:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/333652891_201347962577978_8619411010278477488_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=7CFvw3qgkOoAX96cvUX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBArXTaHJyb27lY4j_ianv0jWGVADXyoSQ8i4GqA_x3tw&oe=655A0764,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTB3amsPDw/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387761213_627546859287409_5862987970998536175_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=M-NF71h_wJ4AX-jXtro&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDphiDroKCOcH0NtLYCqjoZJartdOfAGDCC8ERi1mZ6Tw&oe=65596AF0
instagram,"Israel was founded in 1948. About half of the Jews worldwide migrated to Palestine to create their own state after 2000 years of being in diaspora. They had plans for this going back to the 1880s but the aftermath of WW2 sped up their urgency to relocate. The only problem was that there was already people in Palestine, Jews only bought 6% of the total land, and Jews wanted a Nation to themselves. So they violently kicked out 700,000 natives in an event called the Nakba (Catastrophe) then claimed 78% of the land theirs. There has been 3 major wars since over that event and Israel has held their ground on their newly claimed territory. 

Israel started the conflict between the Palestinians by stealing their homeland and they kill 10x as many people as the Palestinians do. The Hamas invasion was to be expected. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs justifiable but certain actions taken by Israel made the war inevitable. Palestine has been under violent occupation and blockaded for decades. The reason most Americans don‚Äôt hear about it or see the graphic videos is because Jews own/control the Media, Congress, Blackrock, Universities, Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube, ADL and many other important institutions in our society which shape the publics consensus.

The non-Jewish supporters of Israel in America I see are mostly empathetic Christians. It‚Äôs understandable why they would post things like ‚ÄúI stand with Israel‚Äù during these times, they don‚Äôt want to see innocent civilians dying. But they don‚Äôt truly understand the full political context of the situation or know that Israel started the conflict and they kill 10x as many Civilians than Palestinians do. Also Jews aren‚Äôt very fond of Christians.

Israel is 30x richer and they have the upper hand on a massive military power imbalance so they aren‚Äôt under any real existential threat. They allowed the limited invasion to happen as a pretext for War. Israels real motive is to annex Palestine and drag us into a war with Iran.

Ask yourself do you want to fight a war in Iran for the benefit of Israel? I don‚Äôt. The American interest is to make sure that never happens.

instagram,"Re posting my friend @jehane11 ‚Äòs great post: Our most powerful response to the horror in Israel and Palestine is to refuse to surrender our humanity. You will be told by some: The deaths of Israeli children are unfortunate but inevitable, because Israel‚Äôs occupation of Palestine is brutal and wrong. You will be told by others: The deaths of Palestinian children are unfortunate but inevitable, because it is the only way to keep Israel safe from terror, and Hamas brought this on its own people. Both will say: Our aggression is the only response to their aggression, our fear more justified than their fear, our grief more devastating than theirs ever will be. But ‚Ä¶the hierarchy of pain is the old way.The moment we allow our hearts to go numb is the moment we shut down our humanity. I don‚Äôt know the solution to the conflict in Israel and Palestine, but I do know the starting point:To grieve ‚Äútheir‚Äù children as our children. 
It‚Äôs the only way to break the cycle. 
To my loved ones who are Israeli, Jewish,and Palestinian: I see your searing pain. I love you and grieve with you and am reciting my ancestors‚Äô prayers for protection as you search for your families and bear the unbearable.May love find you through the impossible.To all of us witnessing this story: What does love want you to do? 
If you cannot look at the news and the images: It‚Äôs okay. Step away, be with the earth, go to the trees, let them breathe through you; remember that you don‚Äôt need to do all the things, just the one that‚Äôs yours to do. If you want to help but don‚Äôt know how: Begin in relationship. Who in your life is hurting from this? Offer to walk with them, listen to them. There is no fixing grief, only bearing it together. Only then do we know what to do next. 
If you‚Äôre falling apart: Your breathlessness is not a sign of your weakness, but of your strength. Of how deeply you feel the horror, how deeply you care.You still feel. And that matters in a world that wants us to feel nothing. Who can feel it with you? breathe with you? Opening our hearts to grief‚Äîothers and our own‚Äîis how we hold our humanity in a world that would destroy it.

instagram,"Numerous reports that Hamas beheaded children during its attacks on Israel have circulated this week. Here's what journalists across the spectrum and officials have said.

Initial Reports: An Israeli journalist reported Tuesday that Israeli soldiers found ""babies with their heads cut off"" after clearing kibbutz Kfar Aza, which Hamas attacked over the weekend. The video has been viewed nearly 12 million times on X as of Thursday morning. Israeli Defense Forces officials initially said they ""cannot confirm it officially, but you can assume it happened.""

Quotes from Officials: President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he ""never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children."" A spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that babies had been found ""decapitated"" in Kfar Aza, and an IDF spokesman said later that day that ""we can now say with relative confidence that unfortunately this is what happened.""

How the Media Covered It: Left-rated media outlets like CNN and NBC News (both Lean Left bias) highlighted anonymous U.S. government sources who said Biden was citing media reports and hadn't actually seen pictures of Hamas beheading kids. Many left- and center-rated sources framed the reports of beheaded children as unconfirmed. Some right-rated outlets tended to frame the reports as fact-based and focused on IDF comments suggesting the reports were true.

The answer is simple: racism, Islamophobia, double standards, and lack of knowledge. After all, weren't many of you opposed to the ""All Lives Matter"" slogan? And you were right! The lives of oppressed people should be prioritized. Palestinian Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter etc. Etc.
Where were you the last 16 years when childs and baby were bombed in Gaza ? Where were you when all the settlers harrased or kills palestininan civilian, protected by isr.a.e.l.i army and police ? Did you took some time to make a post ? A stories ? White people privilege again i guess. It's not a complicates conflict. It's an apartheid and colonizer state against an oppresed population.

instagram,"Repairing after an argument is the process of resolving and rebuilding the relationship.  It's a necessary conflict-management tool. And it‚Äôs especially important for our little ones.

Kids *seem* to get over things pretty quickly. Their minds are always looking for the next thing to hold their attention. But, in reality, the way we interact with our kids can stick with them for longer than we‚Äôd like to admit.

So, in the short term, repair helps us to mitigate any immediate emotional and behavioral issues related to us losing our cool. It pushes pause on our anger and makes room for normalcy.

In the long-term, repair has even more important repercussions. 

Repair continues to build trust, confidence, and connection in our relationship with our kids. They learn they can express their feelings and be heard and acknowledged. That leads to healthy attachment, which is a necessary part of healthy development. And modeling these repair skills will also imprint important communication and problem-solving skills onto our kids.

Do you want me to walk you through the repair process in real-time?

Congress has been making some interesting stock moves! üìäüíº

üõ°Ô∏è Many are investing in defense giant $GD - General Dynamics, as heightened global tensions often lead to increased defense spending.

üõ¢Ô∏è Republicans are diving into oil & energy stocks, including $XOM, $DVN, and $CVX, because conflicts in the Middle East can disrupt oil supplies, leading to higher oil prices and increased profits for these companies.

üíª Democrats are all about cybersecurity with investments like $FTNT, as cyber threats tend to rise during times of conflict, making cybersecurity companies more essential.

üåç Meanwhile, the world's on edge as Israel declares a state of war after Hamas' invasion.

instagram,"What happened:  Filmmaker and philanthropist Jemima Goldsmith recently took to social media to express her stance on the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Her comments ignited a debate among followers, both in Pakistan and internationally, as she called for condemning both sides of the conflict while emphasizing the importance of international law and human rights.

Details: Jemima Goldsmith posted on social media, stating, ""I stand with the innocent human beings on both sides of this conflict. Condemn both."" In another post, she shared a text-based message that read, ""I stand with International Law and Human Rights. There is no humanity in political tribalism.""

More: Jemima Goldsmith's comments drew many reactions, particularly among Pakistanis. While some expressed support and pride in her stance, others were disappointed. Critics argued that her statements were vague and suggested that she take a clearer position. Some compared her view to ""all lives matter,"" meaning it did not effectively address the specific issues. The debate also touched on colonization and its implications for human rights and international law.

We call on the Canadian government to do all in our power to de-escalate the conflict and to ensure the safety of the hostages and secure their immediate release. The safety of the hostages is a clear priority.

In response to last weekend‚Äôs attacks by Hamas, Israel‚Äôs right wing government has imposed an unlawful siege on Gaza and its civilian population ‚Äì no food, no water, no electricity, no supplies, while knowingly bombing a densely populated civilian area,  causing arbitrary, indiscriminate death and suffering.

To achieve a lasting and just peace in the region, the structure of trauma and violence must end and the parties must return to good faith negotiations based on international law and UN resolutions. All Palestinians and Israelis, and particularly the children of both nations, are entitled to safety and security.

instagram,"A heartbreaking call between a father and his daughter has emerged amid the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict that has killed nearly 3,000 people since October 7 - the day Palestine-based Hamas group launched their murderous invasion of Israel. 

The daughter was at the Supernova music festival when the Hamas terrorists sprayed the thousands of revellers, most of them young adults, with gunfire as they escaped by car and fled through an open field.

""Please send the police, urgently!!!"" the girl is heard saying in Hebrew.

""I am sending them. Mami, Calm down. Stay with me on the line. Don't get offline, okay?"" her father replies to her desperate appeal.

""Be quiet,"" he adds.

""They are crushing me,"" she replies, the fear palpable in her voice.

""Be quiet Mami. Stay crushed,"" the father says.

""Yuvali, my daughter. Take a deep breath, hide. Act dead,"" he adds.

""Injured outside? Explain the situation to me,"" he tells her.

The girl replies, ""Dead bodies over me.""

""Wait, are the terrorists still there,"" he asks her.

""Circling around. Dad, send the police,"" she says in a trembling voice.

""Yuvali, act dead. Hang up the call. Act dead,"" he tells her.

In another audio, the girl is heard telling her mother that she is alive.

""Please tell our family that I am alive and I love them to the infinity. Mom, I want to stay alive. Please let them (police) come,"" she says.

The audio call gives a sense of the nightmare that innocent people faced on October 7 as Hamas men went on a rampage in Israeli towns. 

Supernova music festival, an all-night rave near Kibbutz Re‚Äôim on the Gaza border, was one of the first targets after Hamas's murderous invasion of Israel on October 7. By the end of the massacre, 260 people were murdered.

 Others were captured by the attackers or wounded by the gunfire. Missiles rained down on the area throughout the attack.

instagram,"""Now is a time to think critically. To question everything, even amongst the graphic images, emotive headlines, and unverified tales being parroted as fact by the media bobbleheads, and not allow the gravity of the situation to make us lose our heads,"" says our host, in the opening to this week's Gareth Icke Tonight.
""Remember how 9/11 turned everyone into salivating monsters, calling for repercussions against anyone and everyone, from foreign nations to the local deli owner? And look how that turned out.""

In this week's show opener - NOW STREAMING - Gareth discusses this current, tragic chapter of the long-standing Middle Eastern conflict...

instagram,"Culloden is a powerfully emotive and atmospheric battlefield, the site of one of the most harrowing battles in Britain.

The Battle of Culloden marked a tragic end for the 1745 Jacobite Rising. In less than an hour, 1,600 men were slain ‚Äì 1,500 of them Jacobites.

Jacobites took their last stand at Culloden, fighting to reclaim the throne for the Stuarts. They fought to restore the exiled James VIII, and were led by Prince Charles Edward Stuart, James' son. George II‚Äôs government army, led by his son, the Duke of Cumberland, was equally determined to stop this happening.

The richly researched, stimulating and sensitive Culloden Visitor Centre, which stands beside the battlefield, features artefacts from both sides of the battle and interactive displays that reveal the background to the conflict. It's both a monument and a guide to a pivotal day in history.

#Outlander fans will also recognise the battlefield from early seasons of the hit series starring @samheughan and @caitrionabalfe. 

As a conservation charity, we rely on the generous support of visitors, members and donors to help us continue our vital work in protecting the rich heritage of Scotland. From coastlines to castles, art to architecture, wildlife to wilderness, we encourage people to connect with the things that make our country unique while protecting them for future generations.

instagram,"This prayer of St. Francis asks for guidance in becoming an instrument of peace. The prayer emphasizes the importance of spreading love, forgiveness, faith, hope, light, and joy in places where there is hatred, injury, doubt, despair, darkness, and sadness. It also encourages selflessness and reminds us that by giving and pardoning, we receive and are pardoned.

The unfortunate reality of war is that no one truly wins in such conflicts because innocent civilians bear the brunt of the suffering while their leaders often remain safe and protected. 

This perspective sheds light on the unequal distribution of consequences during times of war, where those in power are shielded from the direct impact.  We need to address this disparity to have a deeper understanding of the true costs of war and the need for greater accountability and protection for innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.

Terrorism is a crime against humanity, whatever the cause, it is not the answer to conflict. 

I join in prayer with the energy of all the mothers from Israel, Palestine, and all over the world to stop all attacks against innocent people who woke up to this nightmare.  May peace reign in the hearts of all inhabitants of this planet.  We must be better than our ancestors. Blessings to all of the heroes and heroines who understand this message and are protecting all innocents on both sides of this conflict.  #nomorebloodshed #nomorehatredüö´ #love #peace #everychildrenareourchildren #peacetoisraelüáÆüá± #peacetopalestineüáµüá∏ #weareone",,851,"{'like_count': 723, 'comment_count': 128, 'num_users': 99905}",Shino Bay Aguilera,,2023-10-12 12:46:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/354532836_122341924215459_736806871805807347_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=AeIG3oxtwOQAX-ZMieh&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAkPmQUBNR9CcuhjI9Qsnr2CCm56SAbqtqLQZQo5nmvyQ&oe=655B6450,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTJw8gLKkh/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387737988_1683970995414054_436226194405672617_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=aA1n4bZS2AQAX9M9GS1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBLhvB4WvYgLeAS-Syif4dD6LeTqojswwWSDZsuiFwzlw&oe=65465C8F

Post from Tara Mandala: The recent outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas is part of an ongoing war where thousands of people are being killed or held hostage. Today, and historically, the amount of death, displacement, and suffering, is inconceivable and devastating. 

We call on you to send prayers, blessings, and practice to this area of the world.

Green Tara practice and mantra is an important practice to be doing right now. You may also do the mantra and practice of the 13th Tara, Dr√∂lma Y√ºll√© Gyaljema, who protects all beings from war and violence, preventing destruction caused by anger and aggression (more info below).

The practice of Green Tara: Imagine yourself as Green Tara, who is seated with one leg in meditation, and one leg stretched out to swiftly respond to those in need. Imagine green light radiating out from her heart, and from the mantra which circles around her heart. Imagine this green light going out to all of those impacted by the war in Israel and Gaza, and helping those who have passed and those who are alive and suffering - bringing healing, shelter, food, clothing, and all forms of relief.

The mantra of Green Tara is:
OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SWAHA

Please also help in other ways. Our meditation needs to be supported by real-world activity.

We thank you for your practice.

~ With Blessings,
Tara Mandala

instagram,"South Korea should take heed of Israel‚Äôs ongoing war against Hamas, an Islamic militant group controlling the Gaza Strip, as the recent incursion illustrates the potential risks posed by North Korea, experts said.

They pointed out that simple and cheaper weapons, if used in a huge barrage like the recent raining down of rockets fired by Hamas, can be destructive enough to make an enemy armed with state-of-the-art defense systems vulnerable.

‚ÄúIf the Iron Dome can‚Äôt stop all of the rockets from Hamas, how is South Korea supposed to stop all the rockets from North Korea in an attack?‚Äù Bruce Bechtol Jr., a former officer of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, said during a phone interview with The Korea Times on Wednesday. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs the question South Koreans need to start asking themselves because North Korea has much more effective rockets than Hamas.‚Äù

The Israel-Hamas conflict has killed over 2,000 people since a barrage of rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip by Hamas on Saturday.

According to the NBC News, President Biden, in a meeting with Jewish leaders on Wednesday, had painted a ‚Äúvivid picture of the horrors‚Äù of the ongoing conflict.

Everyone has a right to feel safe in our community. Hate is not acceptable, and criminal behaviour will not be tolerated. The EPS also tracks non-criminal hate incidents, such as the use of offensive comments or symbols. With the violence escalating in the Middle East, the EPS will be vigilant regarding hate-related events, and will work closely with impacted communities to address safety and security.

Someone on Justin‚Äôs team proposed the banner believing that this was indeed, in Israel, then Justin approved it without a shred of doubt. What does this tell us? 

It shows us that many in west are unaware of the asymmetry and disproportion in the offensive and defensive abilities, infrastructure, and other advantages, between Israel and Palestine. Palestine simply does not possess a tenth of the capabilities needed to inflict a level of destruction we see coming out of Gaza.

During a live coverage on #cnn , a reporter in Gaza was asked by the anchor if she could take shelter underground. The reporter laughingly answered, ‚Äúthere are no shelters here.‚Äù The anchor seemed shocked for a second. 

Western audiences are forming opinions on the ‚ÄúIsrael Palestine conflict‚Äù without factoring in the relevant facts. Politics and history aside, western narratives simply don‚Äôt include an understanding of the major disparities between Palestine‚Äôs and Israel‚Äôs capabilities.

Signed and Numbered Limited Edition Print on Archival Paper (16""x19"") Inquire at info@kushfineart.com for price and availability. 

‚Ä¢ A checkered game board with 64 squares corresponds to the mandala, an image that appears in many cultures and often represents intricate, repeating patterns. ‚Ä¢ The chessboard is the extension of a diagram formed by four squares. Considered as a mandala of Shiva, a popular Hindu deity, it represents the field of action of all the vital forces in the universe that Shiva controls and maintains.

‚Ä¢ In an early Hindu form of the game there were four players ‚Äì one for each of the four sides of the board.

‚Ä¢ Fate, as well as logic, had its say in the outcome of the game: at some point participants would roll the dice to determine the order of the moves. In Lewis Carroll‚Äôs Through the Looking-Glass, Alice finds herself in an alternative world ‚Äú‚Äòmarked out just like a large chessboard!‚Äô Alice said‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a great huge game of chess that‚Äôs being played ‚Äì all over the world‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù Chess represents a combination of, or the eternal conflict between, good and evil, light and darkness, sense and passion. The very alternation of black and white in the chessboard squares is a symbol of fate bestowing, in turn, gifts and sorrows. This idea finds its way into the painting with horses at loggerheads in the background and knights fighting fiercely in the name of the king in the foreground. Fancy towers with unending tops represent the unlimited power of imagination.

instagram,"CORRECTION/EDIT: I‚Äôm aware now that my words about denouncing violence are unclear. It was my mistake to not consider that many, if not most, people would describe acts of resistance as violence. I don‚Äôt put resistance and violence in the same bucket. To be clear: I pledge allegiance to no government and support no war. I am for peace and the right of every human being to live in peace. And when people are being oppressed, they have the right to liberate themselves through acts of resistance. I am pro the Palestinian people having a safe land of their own to live in peacefully and free from any threat of terrorism. I want the same for the Israeli people. I am sickened by the violence perpetrated against innocent human beings throughout this conflict‚Äîthis week and going backwards through history. I hope anyone reading this feels the same. And yes, I believe the modern phase of this conflict is the direct result of white supremacy, greed, dehumanization, and colonialism by MANY rich, powerful governments throughout the world, including that of the United States. There are many entities responsible for the suffering of innocent Palestinian and Israeli people right now. But since I‚Äôm no expert‚Äîas most of us aren‚Äôt‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to end my thoughts and declarations there. I have no fix. I only know that human suffering is something that shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated‚Äîno matter the identity of the human. And that everyone needs to practice seeing each other‚Äôs humanity, and having grace for the same, as a better path to peace.

instagram,"SEEKING THE ULTIMATE TRUTH ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíö

Self-knowledge is true knowledge‚Äîall other knowledge changes. What we learn in school differs based on the period of time. Our school knowledge is not based on what's good for us but rather the best way to govern and control others.

That's why some communities send their children to two schools‚Äîone to learn about others, the other to learn about themselves. So, with all that we think we know, such as the name of the first president, sadly, we don't know who we are. We've spent years believing in the intellect and not the spirit. As a result, we stay child-like, superficially smart, and uninvolved instead of wise and evolved.

With self-knowledge, we become empowered with thoughts that transcend this world. We seek that ultimate truth. But to seek that truth, we must realize the conflict within ourselves.

That conflict is to either remain asleep or wake up. As the story goes, we can be like ""Iai,"" an ass that won't let go of the lies or falsehood. Undoubtedly, we've become stubborn in thinking that the path is one of assimilation with a dominant force, whereas it's one of assimilating with a life force. No one will empower you with self-knowledge, which leads us to the ""ultimate"" truth. Give yourself the gift of waking up to truly being free. -Dr. Robbin Alston

instagram,"New school! Operations on the ground have started to open an Academy School for vulnerable and displaced children in Aden, on the same model as Still I Rise Schools in DRC and North-West Syria. 

Why Yemen? In Yemen, the education crisis is dire. Approximately 2.7 million children lack access to education, facing violence, abuse, child labor, and recruitment into armed groups.

Since 2014, Yemen has experienced a conflict between Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized government. Amidst this turmoil, vital infrastructure, like schools and hospitals, were destroyed. Geopolitical rivalries and proxy interests have further inflamed the situation. 

The number of people who died due to the conflict is estimated to be 377,000, with over half of these fatalities occurring indirectly due to factors like famine and restricted healthcare access.

By the year 2022, a staggering count of 16.2 million individuals‚Äîsurpassing half of the entire population‚Äîwere grappling with acute food scarcity. Alongside this, approximately 4.3 million Yemenis have been forced to relocate within the country's borders due to the ongoing crisis.

The country's economy is in ruins, with homes, farms, and crucial civilian infrastructure destroyed.  The flow of food, heavily reliant on imports, is severely disrupted by the warring factions. Prices are soaring, and many of the poorest have lost their income.

The current humanitarian crisis in Yemen has increased the vulnerability of children and women to exploitation, violence and abuse, child labour, killing and maiming, recruitment and use of children by parties to the conflict as combatants. 

In addition to this, conflict and economic deterioration have compromised people‚Äôs access to health facilities. More than 80% of Yemen‚Äôs population struggles to have safe drinking water and adequate health services. 

After more than 9 years, Yemen remains one of the the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crises. That is why we choose to open our school here!

instagram,"Different Levels of Integration in Integral Yoga 

According to Sri Aurobindo a person has many sides to his personality, each of which is to be expressed, but in view of their discordant movements, each comes in the way of others when they are expressed through mind. This is a big problem in the way of constructive development of the whole personality. In a letter to a disciple, Sri Aurobindo identified a variety of different personalities that expressed themselves in this person's life. These included a vital personality, a psycho-vital personality, a personality of a poet, musician and seeker of beauty, a mental-vital personality, a physical-mental personality, and a mental emotional personality. His vital personality aimed at success and became engaged with it after getting it, ignoring other aspects of his personality. The vital personality sought engagement of a deeper kind and suggested that it would be well to give up the other personalities. The psycho-vital personality was that of a vaishnava that wanted the Divine (Krisna), Bhakti and Ananda. The personality of the poet and musician tried to satisfy its emotional urges through works of art. The mental-vital personality was approving of Vairagya and Nirvana and insisted on a grim struggle of Tapasya when it saw that the vital personality stood in the way. The physical-mental personality was an extrovert and skeptical. The mental-emotional personality had strong belief in the Divine, Yoga, Bhakti and Guruvada. We see from this example how each of us is composed of many different personalities with differing tendencies, often in conflict with one another. 

Integral Yoga is an attempt to harmonize these personalities and to bring about a complete development of the whole personality of a person. It does not encourage the growth of one type of personality at the cost of other types. But this harmonization cannot be done from outside, and it cannot be done by the ordinary mind and vital mind because they are sure to bungle the affair.

instagram,"Our most powerful response to the horror in Israel and Palestine is to refuse to surrender our humanity. 
You will be told by some: The deaths of Israeli children are unfortunate but inevitable, because Israel‚Äôs occupation of Palestine is brutal and wrong.
You will be told by others: The deaths of Palestinian children are unfortunate but inevitable, because it is the only way to keep Israel safe from terror, and Hamas brought this on its own people. 
Both will say: Our aggression is the only response to their aggression, our fear more justified than their fear, our grief more devastating than theirs ever will be. 
But oh my love, the hierarchy of pain is the old way. The moment we allow our hearts to go numb is the moment we shut down our humanity. 
I don‚Äôt know the solution to the conflict in Israel and Palestine, but I do know the starting point: To grieve ‚Äútheir‚Äù children as our children. 
It‚Äôs the only way to break the cycle. 
To my loved ones who are Israeli, Jewish, and Palestinian: I see your searing pain. I love you and grieve with you and am reciting my ancestors‚Äô prayers for protection as you search for your families and bear the unbearable. May love find you through the impossible. 
To all of us witnessing this story: What does love want you to do? 
If you cannot look at the news and the images: It‚Äôs okay. Step away, be with the earth, go to the trees, let them breathe through you; remember that you don‚Äôt need to do all the things, just the one that‚Äôs yours to do. 
If you want to help but don‚Äôt know how: Begin in relationship. Who in your life is hurting from this? Offer to walk with them, listen to them. There is no fixing grief, only bearing it together. Only then do we know what to do next. 
If you are falling apart: Your breathlessness is not a sign of your weakness, but of your strength. Of how deeply you feel the horror, how deeply you care. You still feel. And that matters in a world that wants us to feel nothing. Who can feel it with you? breathe with you?
Opening our hearts to grief‚Äî others and our own‚Äî is how we hold our humanity in a world that would destroy it. It‚Äôs how we will begin to survive this.

instagram,"Early morning on Saturday, October 7, young Israelis attending an all-night rave near Kibbutz Re‚Äôim, adjacent to the Gaza border in Southern Israel, woke up to explosions caused by rocket fire, sounds drowned out only by air raid sirens blaring in warning. But it was too late. 

Hamas militants had already crossed into Israel, breaching the country's heavily fortified border with Gaza. Firing indiscriminately into the crowd, they claimed the lives of at least 260, making the attack the deadliest massacre in Israeli history. And as of writing, they are believed to have taken at least 150 people, mostly civilians, hostage.

The attack prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare, ‚ÄúCitizens of Israel, we are at war. Not an operation, not a round (of fighting), but at war"". Israel has since fired thousands of rockets into Gaza, many of them striking the civilian population.

But what is the conflict about? Who are the Hamas? What about Gaza? Why don't the Palestinians have a state of their own? And how did we reach here?

Our explainer takes you through the key moments that have shaped the decades-long conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, starting with the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 to the present day, focusing on contesting nationalisms and territorial claims, the multiple Middle East wars, the key regional actors involved, attempts at peace, Israeli occupation of territories and Palestinian resistance, and above all, the human suffering that has remained a constant through it all.

It‚Äôs important to look at everything through the Word of God. Start with what Adonai tells Abraham in Genesis and that‚Äôs a good start in understanding the conflict Israel has with the surrounding nations that want to destroy them.

Biden releasing 6 billion dollars to Iran just days before this massacre broke out will surely be used to fund these horrific attacks.

Their statements come, as the armed Hamas group on Thursday fired yet another barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv in response to Israeli air strikes allegedly targeting ""civilians"" in two refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, as claimed by the group.

Buckingham Palace sources have said that King Charles has expressed his deep dismay and strongly condemned the ""barbaric acts of terrorism in Israel"". He is said to be appalled by the ongoing situation and has requested  for regular updates on the evolving crisis.

The King extends sentiments to all those affected, with his ""thoughts and prayers"" directed towards those enduring the consequences of the conflict, particularly those who have lost loved ones, the spokesman added.

instagram,"As the Israeli military intensifies attacks on Gaza in retaliation for the unprecedented weekend assault on southern Israel by militants of the Palestinian group Hamas, there are growing fears of a wider, multi-sided conflict erupting in the Middle East.

Experts say Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has spent decades arming and funding Shiite militants as well as Sunni Palestinian groups in the Middle East. As a result, Israel now faces the possibility of a three- or four-front war, involving Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza and the West Bank, supplemented by Hezbollah and PIJ in Lebanon and Syria.

Lebanon‚Äôs Hezbollah has already fired the first shot across the bows of Israel by launching rockets on Sunday, prompting deadly retaliation by Israel. Artillery exchanges across the border on Monday killed three Hezbollah fighters, two Palestinian militants, and a senior Israeli army officer.

The Pentagon has warned Hezbollah to ‚Äúthink twice‚Äù before opening a second front and said the US was prepared to come to Israel‚Äôs defense. The Central Command has despatched the USS Gerald R.

instagram,"‚ÄúThe Myth of Redemptive Violence is the story of the victory of order over chaos by means of violence. It is the ideology of conquest, the original religion of the status quo. The gods favour those who conquer. Conversely, whoever conquers must have the favour of the gods.

Religion exists to legitimate power and privilege. Life is combat. Any form of order is preferable to chaos, according to this myth. Ours is neither a perfect nor perfectible world; it is theatre of perpetual conflict in which the prize goes to the strong. Peace through war, security through strength: these are the core convictions that arise from this ancient historical religion, and they form the solid bedrock on which the Domination System is founded in every society.

When the good guy finally wins, viewers are then able to reassert control over their own inner tendencies, repress them, and re-establish a sense of goodness without coming to any insight about their own inner evil. The villain‚Äôs punishment provides catharsis; one forswears the villain‚Äôs ways and heaps condemnation on him in a guilt-free orgy of aggression. Salvation is found through identification with the hero.

No other religious system has even remotely rivaled the myth of redemptive violence in its ability to catechise its young so totally. From the earliest age, children are awash in depictions of violence as the ultimate solution to human conflicts. Nor does saturation in the myth end with the close of adolescence. There is no rite of passage from adolescent to adult status in the national cult of violence‚Ä¶

Not all shows for children or adults are based on violence, of course. Reality is far more complex than the simplicities of this myth, and maturer minds will demand more subtle, nuanced, complex presentations

Redemptive violence gives way to violence as an end in itself. It is no longer a religion that uses violence in the pursuit of order and salvation, but one in which violence has become an aphrodisiac, sheer titillation, an addictive high, a substitute for relationships. Violence is no longer the means to a higher good, namely order; violence becomes the end.‚Äù Walter Wink",,591,"{'like_count': 570, 'comment_count': 21, 'num_users': 11916}",Dr. David Bennett,,2023-10-12 05:34:18,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/393976237_697263079007027_4280801398896923985_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=RrS_RaW3ikIAX99swYg&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfD9Ij8GkUZcxzoL-MGU0i89P1J5gfOirKjJFW7dZPHDxg&oe=655B9B53,https://www.instagram.com/p/CySYWhdOBry/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387657088_1467768550671468_7010046339792530250_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=eIeQedObhc0AX9vKdkz&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCrn0p3E3aYycUlboYAj6HzM9ctuxltpT1Uu87sCbLr2Q&oe=6536DFD3
instagram,"US National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby confirmed that the United States will be sending the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean, after it was already announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford would be deployed as part of ‚Äúsupport‚Äù operations related to the Israel-Gaza conflict.

However, Kirby said that the Eisenhower will not be directly joining or escorting. Instead, the carrier will be in the region for availability if called upon. While in a press briefing Kirby tried to downplay the dual carrier deployment as somewhat routine or expected, they will certainly be on standby to potentially intervene if all hell continues breaking loose in the Middle East.

Kirby also confirmed that the US administration is in talks with Qatar as part of mediation efforts to free the hostages being held by Hamas. It‚Äôs believed there are Americans among the captives in Gaza, which at this moment is being pounded by Israeli airstrikes. Kirby said the following:

‚ÄúObviously, we‚Äôre in discussions not only with the Israelis, about what hostage recovery could look like, but with other allies and partners in the region. And there are some countries like Qatar that have open lines of communication with Hamas, so of course, we‚Äôre casting the net wide as you would expect, we want to get these all the hostages back with their families, particularly the American hostages, no question about that.‚Äù",,581,"{'like_count': 491, 'comment_count': 90, 'num_users': 259745}",Mindsetofthetruth,,2023-10-12 09:57:28,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/363872250_631307132305954_8043861386779767334_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=QpiI3gSGCOsAX9Une5T&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDjcFeq1kT3bGZAjf8Z77yAoh1ET3emubPOK6ztpmieDw&oe=655AE61B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyS2eGBoUAX/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387780327_707640937465989_245083143788515579_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0abbV0T4_pkAX8ZjMy0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCOU-Lynqc4KGfWNqxROcooVuUFyDFYM79fe2cBb5FxbA&oe=65375816

Witnessing parents fighting in front of children can leave deep scars on their hearts and minds. Let's create a peaceful and loving environment for our little ones. 

constant exposure to parental conflict can cause significant emotional distress for children. They may feel anxious, scared, or overwhelmed by the tension and hostility in their environment. 

Children who grow up in an environment filled with constant fighting may also struggle with communication and conflict resolution skills, leading to challenges in their own relationships later in life. 

Children may blame themselves for their parents' arguments, believing that they are the cause of the conflict. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and a distorted sense of self-worth. 

In conclusion, parents fighting in front of children can have devastating effects on their emotional well-being and overall development. It is crucial for parents to create a safe and nurturing environment for their children, where conflicts are resolved peacefully and respectfully.

instagram,"Love. Grieve. Rest. Dream.
.
Lots of us are grieving right now. Some are grieving the loss of life. Some are grieving the people we couldn‚Äôt take with us as we walk our own path to collective liberation. Some are grieving dreams and ideals that we won‚Äôt get to live or see in this lifetime. And fuck it hurts.
.
This sentiment from @gabestorres has lived in my heart for a while. I‚Äôm grieving and angry and frustrated but I remain committed to loving ferociously. I have watched a number of relationships crumble in recent days. People venting their anger onto me because they feel impotent to stop a violent conflict overseas whereas I‚Äôm only a text, DM or call away. And tho I am setting boundaries so that I am not the receptacle for misplaced anger, I am loving and grieving from afar. I‚Äôm praying that the people I can‚Äôt keep right now eventually find peace for themselves and will work toward a collective peace in the future.
.
So while I may be sad and frustrated and disappointed, I am also firmly and fiercely committed to NOT hardening my heart. As one of my favorite comrades reminds me ‚Äúhow we organize IS our politic.‚Äù And so I will continue to aspire to love in ways that devastatingly disrupt state violence. I will dream revolutionary dreams and work audaciously to build a future I can only partially imagine right now.
.
And in the meantime though it hurts. I think a lot of us are grieving and I want to make space for that: 
üíõWhat are you grieving right now? 
üíõWhat is giving you comfort or peace in the midst of your grief?

Credit where credit is due: These images come from @gabestorres whose wisdom I deeply deeply appreciate. Gabes build on the words of Angela Davis here. And if you know you know but the sentiment in this caption is heavily influenced by bell hooks, @adriennemareebrown @thenapministry and @valariekaur.

Greenstein, in fact, was supposed to leave last Sunday to lead a trip to Israel and would have been there right now. But after the Hamas rocket launches started, Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv was closed.‚Å†

‚ÄúThere is not a home or apartment in Israel that hasn‚Äôt been touched by this,‚Äù Greenstein said. ‚ÄúEverybody has had someone killed or wounded or taken hostage.""‚Å†

instagram,"We need to remember that actual people are suffering right now. This isn‚Äôt a movie or a sport this is a real war with the lives of real civilians hanging in the balance. The Israeli government and Hamas have done countless horrific things and are doing horrific things right now. The cycle of escalating violence goes back to the very origins of Israeli and Palestinian national identity. We can argue about who is more to blame for the current hostilities (I would argue Hamas is the most to blame and that Israel has a right to defend itself from terrorism but many would argue with me about that). However what we should all agree on a few things. 
1. Violent dehumanizing rhetoric against civilian populations by both random people and public officials needs to be met with condemnation. 
2. The international community should be pushing both sides to limit civilian casualties and suffering as much as humanly possible. (Ie Hamas should release all hostages and Israel should not pursue wartime strategies that will lead to unnecessary civilian casualties.)
3. In the long term we need to find a way for Israelis and Palestinians to both be able to live in this region in peace, liberty, and prosperity. (In my opinion a two state solution is the best way to achieve this but again others will disagree)

As a Jewish person I am very emotionally invested in this conflict and if I have failed to cover it fairly I apologize. I am sincerely trying my best to use this little platform I have in a way that is constructive and I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs always a work in progress.

instagram,"A Maltese metal band who were touring Israel have made it back to Malta after the country plunged into a mode of war against Palestine this week.

‚ÄúWe are back on home soil!,‚Äù the group Damaged & Co. wrote online.

The five piece group were traveling around Israel since the beginning of October, with gigs in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The tour kicked off well, the band recalled, however everything changed once in Tel Aviv.

‚ÄúOur journey started on an excellent note with the event at the Wunderbar Club, Haifa. We immensely enjoyed our time there with Proxy , ZedDestructive and a very warm crowd. The management and staff of the club were the perfect hosts. Another memorable evening was at The Wave Club in Tel Aviv,‚Äù the group wrote.
‚ÄúFrom there, everything changed with a dramatic fashion.‚Äù

On 7th October, Hamas, a militant Palestnian group, launched a suprise attack on Israel, launching thousands of missiles and killing at least 1,200. Israel forces have responded in brutal force, with the death toll from airstrikes on Gaza tolling at least 830 people on Tuesday and, while more than 180,000 had been made homeless, according to the UN.

As the situation became increasingly hostile, the gigs in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with four other bands were cancelled. the band then waited for authorities to help work on ways to get out of Israel.

Damaged & Co thanked all those who offered support, including those in Israel, their families and Malta‚Äôs Embassy.

‚ÄúThank you to all who showed concern and offered support for our difficult situation. Above all, our families and loved ones who had to go through this ordeal with us. No words of gratitude will ever be enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur thoughts remain with our friends who are still caught in the conflict. Our plight might be over but theirs is ongoing. May this conflict be resolved in the shortest time possible so that no more blood is spilled.‚Äù

instagram,"You've been hearing about the Israel-Palestine conflict for years (including, hopefully, our 2014 magazine cover story). But what's happening this week is different. It's war. ‚Å†
‚Å†
On Saturday, terrorist militant group Hamas launched a surprise and significant attack on Israel. Militants killed more than 750 Israelis and took countless more hostage for torture and eventual slaughter. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Israel swiftly responded with a forceful air and sea strike and cut off Gaza‚Äôs access to energy, food and water. The total death toll has risen to more than 2,300, with over 8,000 injured, making this the deadliest Palestinian militant attack in Israel's 75-year-old history. ‚Å†
‚Å†
We spoke to Todd Deatherage, the co-founder of the Telos Group who has spent decades working with government leaders on the conflict, about what led to this weekend‚Äôs attack, what an end goal might look like, and what American Christians can do to promote peace over conflict. ‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúMaking space for the humanity of Palestinians doesn‚Äôt mean you condone the ideology of Hamas or the brutality of these recent attacks,‚Äù Deatherage said. ‚ÄúMaking space for Israelis doesn't mean you condone the policies of the current government or the decades of occupation and control of Palestinians.‚Äù ‚Å†

instagram,"What happened: Pro-Palestinian demonstrations occurred in several Canadian cities on Thanksgiving Day, following a weekend of deadly fighting in the Middle East. In contrast, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre spoke at a vigil at a Jewish community center in Ottawa. Justin Trudeau says on the conflict in Israel & Palestine.
""Hamas terrorists aren't a resistance. They are not freedom fighters.""

Details: Protesters gathered in front of Toronto City Hall at Nathan Phillips Square, where many waved Palestinian flags and chanted slogans to support Palestine's freedom. The city's mayor criticized the demonstration. One sign at the protest read, ""Occupation is a crime, resistance is a response.""

More: Global Affairs Canada reported one Canadian death and two Canadians missing amid the ongoing conflict.
Prime Minister Trudeau condemned the attack at a vigil in Ottawa's Soloway Jewish Community Centre, where he characterized Hamas as terrorists despite his low ratings.

Aso: Counter-protesters, who waved or wore Israeli flags, shouted at pro-Palestine demonstrators in Toronto. Police erected barricades to separate the groups. The pro-Palestine protesters greatly outnumbered the counter-protesters and emphasized their advocacy for Palestinian liberation without promoting hatred against Jewish people.

What you need to know: Despite opposition from several city councilors and the mayor, Olivia Chow, the Palestinian demonstration in Toronto proceeded. Chow criticized the protest glorifying the recent violence, including murder and kidnapping, by Hamas against Israeli civilians. In contrast, other politicians, including Doug Ford and Chrystia Freeland, expressed unequivocal support for Israel's right to defend itself at a gathering in Toronto's North York neighborhood. Approximately 250 police officers and private security officials were present to maintain order at the event. The situation underscores the deep divisions and passionate opinions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Canada and the broader international community.

instagram,"US supermodel Gigi Hadid has spoken out about the ongoing deadly conflict between Israel and Palestine, describing it as an ""unjustifiable tragedy"". She has thrown her support behind Palestine's struggle while also condemning the violence that has arisen as a result of the attacks.

The 28-year-old, who is a person of Palestinian origin herself and has been a longtime advocate for the ""Free Palestine"" movement alongside her sister Bella Hadid, has said that she feels a responsibility to her Jewish friends to make it clear that she does not support the harm of any Jewish person. She has also said that she believes being pro-Palestine does not equal being antisemitic.

""I have deep empathy and heartbreak for the Palestinian struggle and life under occupation; it's a responsibility I hold daily. I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person,"" she wrote on Instagram.

instagram,"I have taken the last few days to sift through all the images, words, information, misinformation, feelings, pain abound about Palestine & Israel. 

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôve arrived:

I‚Äôm fighting the urge - born from fatigue, overwhelm, and the stress of injustice - to live in avoidance, to duck my head, to cloak my heart, to do or say nothing in the face of suffering and injustice. 

Before speaking, I paused. I read. I listened. I prayed. I‚Äôm praying. I felt. I‚Äôm feeling.

I mourn the loss of life. I grieve for those who have lost. I try to empathize with those hurting. I wince at the pain of children. 

I resist the temptation to compare suffering. I pray for peace in the Holy Land and peace in peoples‚Äô bodies. 

I also bear witness to the truth: an occupier and an occupied. 

I do not ignore the continuing, decades long occupation of Palestinian people by Israel that paints the backdrop of this moment. 

I do not selectively or naively condemn conduct without acknowledging this context.

I understand that violence begets violence. That hurt people hurt people. 

That dehumanization will be met with resistance. That resistance doesn‚Äôt always look perfect or feel palatable. That resistance causes trauma because it‚Äôs born from trauma. 

That the lines between aggression & self-defense unfortunately get blurry. That innocent or civilian can sadly become relative terms in the context of an ongoing occupation and conflict. It‚Äôs a tragic, unrelenting kill or be killed ecosystem that produces pain abound for all peoples.

That this occupation - unless acknowledged & interrupted - will perpetually produce a cycle of violence, inhumanity, and insecurity. 

So I stand on the side of peace. of safety. of justice. of dignity. of life. of love. of liberation.

And I know that to achieve those realities for all people we must start with manifesting that reality for the Palestinian people.

Blinken will also hold talks with the #Palestinian and #Jordanian leaders in Amman on Friday, a US official said. 

A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in #Gaza as residents run out of fuel and electricity amid Israeli air strikes.

The death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to 1,200 people, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Thursday, following an increase in Israeli bombardments on the sixth day since Hamas's surprise attack. The Israeli armed forces reported that 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attack.

11th PDT 21:04 / 12th AEDT 15:04
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Mars enters Scorpio today, where it will transit for the next six weeks, adding urgency to decisions and emotional exchanges. Mars last transited this sign between October 30 and December 13, 2021. Look back over these dates to draw personal parallels. What projects and pursuits were consuming your attention?
 
Mars is in domicile in the sign of the scorpion, a sign which typically conjures buzzwords like ‚Äúprovocation‚Äù and ‚Äúpower‚Äù. And to say that Mars in Scorpio provides us with the intuitive means to leverage our will would be an understatement. However, Mars‚Äô primary motive here is not necessarily to assert dominance, but to initiate transformation.
 
Overall, this impetus is productive and healing in nature. Yet Scorpio is the domain of the unconscious mind, and when we allow maligned or repressed aspects of our psyche to call the shots, conflict inevitably intensifies. Here, we plot. We scheme. We wait patiently to make our move with concentrated force and strategic finesse. While our opponent has been watching the plays, WE have been watching our opponent. And we may win the battle‚Ä¶but at what cost? Fear-based decisions yield fear-based results. Manipulation tactics ensure mutual destruction.
 
This influence‚Äôs POSITIVE potency lies in getting us up close and personal with unrelenting, inevitable change‚Ä¶and discovering our own authority in the process of deconstruction and reconstruction. Mars in Scorpio permits us to ditch unhealthy patterns and recommit to our passions. It encourages us to extricate ourselves from toxic situations. We can walk away from that which we once felt powerless to resist. Additionally, as the Aries North Node presently answers to Mars, the warrior planet will be playing a broader energetic role in the upcoming eclipses in Libra (14/15) and Taurus (28/29). Cord-cutting promises to be one of the month‚Äôs most potent spells, functioning, perhaps, as the dynamic conclusion to this year‚Äôs Venus retrograde drama.

instagram,"Discover new works by Stikki Peaches now on view at Art Angels 

Canadian artist Stikki Peaches is best known for his satirical graffiti and multilayered wheat-paste prints bursting with nostalgic pop culture references, punk symbols, and tattoo designs. Much like Banksy, Stikki operates in complete anonymity and has been photographed only while masked. Stikki‚Äôs works can be identified by their pastiche style of composition and the tagline ‚ÄúWhat if Art Ruled the World?‚Äù which imagines a conflict-free society governed by artistic expression and appreciation. While he intentionally distanced himself from the contemporary art scene, Stikki Peaches today finds himself one of its enigmatic stars, occupying the liminal space between the street and the gallery. Stikki‚Äôs eye-popping commercial art has been exhibited in shows in New York and at Art Basel Miami, and his works have been purchased by celebrities including Lady Gaga. His murals can be found on the streets of Paris, New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Berlin, Stockholm, London, and his hometown of Montreal.

""Tel Aviv has no issue with the presence of nations that support the Palestinian people while simultaneously condemning terrorism, much like the Kingdom of Morocco,"" the diplomat noted.

Ben Dor further emphasized that Tel Aviv will not assist what he referred to as ""terrorists"" from Hamas in their aspirations, asserting that ""this attack against our land has only strengthened our determination to repel them, and we will not cease until we achieve that.""

The diplomat called on Arab countries to support Israel against ""terrorism"" and urged different nations genuinely aspiring for peace in the region to condemn what he referred to as ""terrorist acts.""

For several days now, we have been living in pain, in confusion, in a painful sense of helplessness that makes us fragile, vulnerable, disoriented, and above all, deeply saddened. For there is nothing more contagious than the pain of innocent men, women, old people and children. The horror of innocent humans brutally torn from their loved ones, beaten, imprisoned, tortured and diabolically terrorized is something that tears at the heart of anyone with a heart capable of beating for their fellow man. As parents, how can we not put ourselves in the shoes of those parents whose children's fate is unknown to them! As human beings, how can we not feel the dramatic echo of so much suffering! As human beings, where can we find hope, optimism, joy of life, when so much of our unfortunate humanity can go? Yet each of us knows in his conscience that every conflict, from the most trivial to the most bitter, is always and only an intellectual accident. We all know the weapons with which we could avoid their tragic consequences. What prevents us from using them? As people of faith, we pray with all our hearts that this will end as soon as possible; that everyone will be able to reunite with their loved ones and return to their homes. Let us pray. Let us pray with contrite hearts, with consistency and intensity, hoping in our hearts that this will end soon.",,444,"{'like_count': 412, 'comment_count': 32, 'num_users': 86969}",Mary McWhorter,,2023-10-12 13:02:03,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/241231225_279883310264503_4681180347431544070_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=QHwGAhshbVYAX8XHrXn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBcoxFT3fuPFMlt0XHkyDCejCg5LOKLTCDW44wyk9anBw&oe=6559B1C6,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTLmBnL43k/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387689557_2331215753738524_6975420841572284106_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=674m0VGaxz8AX-qK3Oo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDKXjW6IxK_0WXNvUKAWLGoYSnfr0JN-sYMbYjZbNsw5Q&oe=6534E835
instagram,"üí†The Battle of Lemnos- The Forgotten Rus'-Byzantine War, 1024
*
‚öîÔ∏èOne of the latest things I've discovered in Byzantine history was the conflict between a band of Kievan Rus' troops and the Byzantines in 1024 when the Byzantine Empire was at a time of peace and prosperity. In 1024, just a year before the great emperor Basil II's death (1025)- where my game is set in- a small conflict broke out in Byzantium when 800 Rus' warriors led by a certain Chrysocheir sailed to Byzantium to enlist in the legendary Varangian Guard. Unfortunately, the only source that discusses this conflict is the history of John Skylitzes who mentions that in 1024, a Rus' leader namer Chrysocheir sailed with 800 men to Constantinople to enlist in the Varangian Guard of Emperor Basil II. It is also noted that Chrysocheir was a relative of the late Kievan Rus' prince Vladimir, the brother-in-law of Basil II; although Chrysocheir was probably a Greek translation of his name whereas his real name remains unknown though it could be derived from the Old Norse Audmundr. 
*
üåä When in Constantinople, Chrysocheir and his men were asked to surrender their weapons before entering the city to enlist. Chrysocheir however refused to surrender his weapons and so he and his men sailed south into the Marmara Sea and into the Aegean after defeating a Byzantine fleet at the Dardanelles. The Rus' then set themselves up in the Greek island of Lemnos where they were eventually confronted by a larger Byzantine fleet led by the Strategos of the Samos Theme David of Ohrid and troops from Thessaloniki led by the general Nikephoros Kabasilas. The Byzantine commanders initially pretended to negotiate with the Rus' and so the Rus' fell for it only for the Byzantines to suddenly trap the Rus' and kill them all including their leader Chrysocheir. Now do any of you know about this rather forgotten conflict in 1024??

instagram,"MERCY Malaysia's team in Gaza, in collaboration with local volunteers, recently distributed 600 family kits to three hospitals in Gaza, Palestine. These hospitals include Asyifa Hospital, Jabaliyah Hospital, and Rumah Sakit Indonesia Gaza.

These family kits, an essential lifeline, were delivered with the aim of providing crucial support to the people in Gaza. They serve as a testament to MERCY Malaysia's unwavering commitment to alleviating the suffering of the community and fostering resilience within it. In addition to these kits, MERCY Malaysia is actively engaged in other life-saving initiatives, such as the supply of medicines and fuel to operate ambulances. This is crucial, as the casualties of the conflict extend beyond combatants, with a significant number of civilian fatalities on both sides.

MERCY Malaysia is monitoring the humanitarian needs and impact, and looking at all possibilities to provide aid to support those in need of humanitarian assistance.

‚Å†
The Israel Embassy in Washington, D.C. reports that over 1,000 Israelis have lost their lives while the Palestinian Ministry of Health is reporting at least 830 deaths in Gaza.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hamas militants infiltrated Israel by land, by sea, and by air. It is that last method which has drawn much attention after photos and videos emerged showing militants swoop down from the sky in paragliders.‚Å†
‚Å†
That is a low-cost way to mount an attack that requires little training, paraglider Jim Shepherd tells Inside Edition. The cost meanwhile would be approximately $10,000 for a new paraglider or $6,000 for a used version, says Shepherd.‚Å†

instagram,"SEEKING THE ULTIMATE TRUTH ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíö

Self-knowledge is true knowledge‚Äîall other knowledge changes. What we learn in school differs based on the period of time. Our school knowledge is not based on what's good for us but rather on the best way to govern and control others.

That's why some communities send their children to two schools‚Äîone to learn about others, the other to learn about themselves. So, with all that we think we know, such as the name of the first president, sadly, we don't know who we are. We've spent years believing in the intellect and not the spirit. As a result, we stay child-like, superficially smart, and uninvolved instead of wise and evolved.

With self-knowledge, we become empowered with thoughts that transcend this world. We seek that ultimate truth. But to seek that truth, we must realize the conflict within ourselves.

That conflict is to either remain asleep or wake up. As the story goes, we can be like ""Iai,"" an ass that won't let go of the lies or falsehood. Undoubtedly, we've become stubborn in thinking that the path is one of assimilation with a dominant force, whereas it's one of assimilating with a life force. No one will empower you with self-knowledge, which leads us to the ""ultimate"" truth. Give yourself the gift of waking up to truly being free. -Dr. Robbin Alston

instagram,"Photography does not automatically lend itself to narrative. Building a story arc with individual pictures requires a sense of time, place, character, and causality. This is a photo essay that I did in 2005 for the New York Times Magazine about a road being built in impovrished rural Nepal by Maoist guerrillas using conscripted labour. In this case, I used black-and-white film and a classic linear story arc. The images attempt to distill a complex series of events during a long-running conflict into a tight narrative. We will be discussing the relationship between photography and narrative at my upcoming workshop at @domainecazenac in #Dordogne, France in mid-November.

instagram,"A prominent international law firm based in Chicago has rescinded an offer of employment to a law student at #NewYorkUniversity who sent a message to the school‚Äôs #StudentBarAssociation (SBA) expressing ‚Äúabsolute solidarity‚Äù with #Hamas‚Äô terrorist onslaught against #Israel.

‚Äú#Winston&Strawn learned that a former summer associate published certain inflammatory comments regarding Hamas‚Äô recent terrorist attack on Israel and distributed it to the NYU Student Bar Association,‚Äù the law firm said in a statement. ‚ÄúThese comments profoundly conflict with Winston & Strawn‚Äôs values as a firm. Accordingly, the firm has rescinded the law student‚Äôs offer of employment.‚Äù

The student ‚Äî #RynaWorkman, president of the SBA ‚Äî had sent a message to the #NYU student group on Hamas‚Äô invasion of Israel, which resulted in more than 1,000 Israeli deaths. Thousands of Israelis were also injured, and dozens were kidnapped and taken as hostages to neighboring #Gaza.

‚ÄúI want to express, first and foremost, my unwavering and absolute solidarity with Palestinians in their resistance against oppression,‚Äù Workman wrote. ‚ÄúIsrael bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life ‚Ä¶ I will not condemn Palestinian resistance.‚Äù

Workman went on to accuse Israel of ‚Äúapartheid‚Äù and ‚Äúsettler colonialism‚Äù before concluding, ‚ÄúPalestine will be free.‚Äù

Winston & Strawn said in its statement that the firm remains ‚Äúoutraged and deeply saddened by the violent attack on Israel over the weekend. Our hearts go out to our #Jewish colleagues, their families, and all those affected.‚Äù The firm added that it ‚Äústands in solidarity with Israel‚Äôs right to exist in peace and condemns Hamas and the violence and destruction it has ignited in the strongest terms possible.‚Äù

New York University‚Äôs Law School on Tuesday released its own statement disavowing Workman‚Äôs comments, which widely circulated on social media and triggered an uproar demanding that the school clarify its position on them.

1. The Israeli intelligence services are not invincible

The scale of the attack and the logistics needed to carefully carry coordinated attacks by land, air and sea, as to build or smuggle in rockets and drones would have required hundreds of people working over months. Israeli intelligence services ‚Äì as well as those of the United States and Israel‚Äôs European allies ‚Äì picked up nothing. Even more importantly, once something of the scale of the attack became clear, the military reacted in a haphazard and chaotic fashion, losing time to respond. Writing in The Atlantic, Andrew Exum, a former US military officer who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy in the Pentagon, mentions the Israel Defence Force‚Äôs (IDF‚Äôs) complacency and lack of discipline, and how the Hezbollah ‚Äì especially after the 2006 conflict with Israel ‚Äì holds the IDF ‚Äúin contempt‚Äù because of these qualities.

2. A long-term political disaster heaped onto the IDF

Many commentators in Israel and elsewhere immediately mentioned the 1973 war and the way the then Israeli prime minister Golda Meir had rebuffed outreach by Egyptian president Anwar Sadat. This convinced Sadat that the only way to recover the Sinai territories lost by Egypt in the 1967 war was to go to war again. In that sense, both the 1973 war and the attack by Hamas seem not just to be an intelligence failure but also a failure of the intelligence of Benjamin Netanyahu.

We wish to express our utmost solidarity with victims of war who face unjust suffering and attack. We stand with the Palestinian people of Gaza, West Bank, and Jordan, as well as those in refugee camps and the wider diaspora displaced globally who are still awaiting their right of return. We support the Palestinian struggle for liberation and autonomy from the settler apartheid state of Israel that has brutally oppressed their community and other dissenters for many decades, and we condemn Israel‚Äôs bombardment of Gaza and the blockade that deprives Palestinians of basic necessities like food, water, and fuel. We recognize that political parties and governments are not representative of either Palestinian or Jewish peoples. 

As an educational space, we advise being wary and critical of disinformation that aims to create selective outrage and division rather than building towards peace. Occupation, colonization and land theft are the root causes of conflict in Palestine. Direct action, and political resistance to settler violence is necessary. The dehumanization and targeting of vulnerable civilians is always unjustified and we reject any defense of it. It is grossly insensitive to advocate for war crimes in the privilege and comfort of our homes in Canada, and far away from facing the ensuing dangers. We have people in our collective who have experienced trauma and loss from occupation, war and resistance activism, and who have had their lives permanently altered in ways that many of us cannot imagine. We also have Jewish anarchists who are staunchly anti-zionist, and are committed to a free and just Palestine for everyone. We extend our compassion and sympathy for all innocent lives lost. We will continue to advocate for solutions that support liberating Palestinians from colonial violence, and providing peaceful co-existence for all civilians.

Much love to everyone who is deeply affected by these events, and may we continue to hold strong the ideas of liberation, freedom and equity for all.",,402,"{'like_count': 400, 'comment_count': 2, 'num_users': 2963}",Camas Books & Infoshop,,2023-10-12 00:52:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/79638708_479642079631801_56385400108744704_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NYSq4u2ibnwAX-FsNmo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBecNCmlecJuZoIzs256HF0XlFdpZs3oumU3NyNhuVtpg&oe=655A4481,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyR4DXDpSTX/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387681174_23972080419104090_1031352434757306801_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CajcPqxcVcMAX-NO1Uo&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAZDSeJCt0nY-IwhNJv6bmDIBNcXMxf6_jZzFELfFHOKA&oe=655725F7

instagram,"""The New York Times has greeted the Hamas terrorist onslaught against Israel that killed more than 1,000 with a thermometer-like chart depicting a competition between ‚ÄúIsraeli and Palestinian conflict-related deaths,‚Äù as if Israeli children and grandmothers murdered in cold blood were somehow morally equivalent to Israel‚Äôs self-defense killings of terrorists.

One former New York Times columnist, Max Fisher, celebrated the appearance of the game-show style graphic on the newspaper‚Äôs website home page. ‚ÄúA sign of how much US popular and journalistic attitudes have changed,‚Äù Fisher posted on X/Twitter. ‚ÄúI did this exact chart at Vox during the 2014 war and got screamed at for weeks. David Frum accused me of agitating for murder of Jews. Ted Cruz condemned. Now it‚Äôs on the NYT HP without a blip.‚Äù

Not entirely without a blip. One Times reader, David Rusenko, posted, ‚ÄúJust canceled my @nytimes subscription. Shockingly biased coverage on the front page right now. All photos of damage or injury are Palestinian, and photos representing Israel are of tanks, the iron dome, and people hiding safely.‚Äù

Rusenko went on: ‚ÄúZero mention of the kidnapping, rape, and murder of Israeli civilians and the gleeful filming as their bodies are paraded around the streets. And to add insult to injury, they have the gall of featuring a graph of the relative deaths from the last 15 years, implying that either the attack was justified or minimizing the current deaths. Disgusting.‚Äù

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) hasn‚Äôt left the Times off the hook. Cruz retweeted radio host Mark Levin‚Äôs cautionary words: ‚ÄúWatch the New York Times, which covered up the Holocaust while millions of Jews were being exterminated. Watch how it turns on the Israeli Jews as Israel acts to wipe out Hamas. Watch how most of the rest of the media line up behind it.‚Äù

The senator also warned, 'Hamas uses civilians as human shields. When Israel strikes back, the useful idiots at the New York Times and CNN will denounce Israel for murdering civilians. Don‚Äôt believe the lies.'""

Experts and leaders will soon come together in their thousands at the first¬†UN conference dedicated to water¬†in nearly half a century.

At the conference, which begins on March 22 in New York, delegates will no doubt stress that ‚Äúwater is life‚Äù. And it‚Äôs true: water nourishes, cleanses and even inspires the poetry and painting so desperately needed by our modern and rushed society. We really cannot live without it.

But as a professor of water security who focuses on its role in conflict, I know that water is death, too. And I don‚Äôt just mean the awesome destructive force of floods ‚Äì hundreds of children in Pakistan and twice as many adults drowned when a ‚Äúmonsoon on steroids‚Äù burst the banks of the Indus River last summer ‚Äì or agonising spells of drought.

I mean the way we use water in war ‚Äì or more specifically, as a tool towards violent political or military objectives, when water becomes a tactical weapon and a strategic battlefield resource.

Au Sahel, la multiplication des attaques men√©es par le Groupe de soutien √† l‚Äôislam et aux musulmans (GSIM, affili√© √† Al-Qaida) et son concurrent de l‚ÄôEtat islamique au Sahel (EIS) contredit brutalement la propagande des putschistes sur la mont√©e en puissance de leurs arm√©es respectives et les place face √† leurs promesses non tenues. Les trois officiers au pouvoir √† Bamako, Ouagadougou et Niamey avaient √©vinc√© leurs pr√©d√©cesseurs en d√©non√ßant leur imp√©ritie dans la lutte contre les djihadistes. Depuis leur arriv√©e au sommet de l‚ÄôEtat, force est de constater qu‚Äôils n‚Äôont pas fait mieux que les pouvoirs civils ou militaire qu‚Äôils ont remplac√©s.

Au Niger, o√π la junte est parvenue √† obtenir le retrait de l‚Äôarm√©e fran√ßaise, avec qui elle menait le combat contre les islamistes arm√©s, au moins 60 soldats, selon plusieurs sources, ont √©t√© tu√©s le 2 octobre dans la r√©gion de Tahoua (centre) par l‚ÄôEIS. Au Mali, o√π le gouvernement de transition s‚Äôest lanc√© en ao√ªt dans une offensive contre les ex-rebelles s√©paratistes install√©s dans le nord du pays, les positions de l‚Äôarm√©e subissent chaque semaine des attaques du GSIM.

instagram,"The intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its latest unimaginable horrors has shaken us all to the core. The pain from the brutality of the circumstances, like a vice around our hearts, is inescapable, no matter the affiliation. It is hard to contain emotions. 

Muhammad Deif and his Hamas butchers can only be qualified as inhuman. Who else would inflict such indiscriminate loss of life on religious and political grounds? To call them animals is an insult to all species. 

As we collectively mourn this ongoing tragedy, we must also try to understand the source of this dehumanized indoctrination in order to correct it. A few things come to mind. 

People rarely turn into killing machines in a vacuum. The Hamas leadership must be eradicated, sure, but what does that mean? Without a change in policy and a philosophical commitment to humanizing relationships on both sides, despite the historical hardships, is it reasonable to expect a different outcome? 

Netanyahu has been in power for 16 years and his myopic leadership is at least in part responsible for the utter failure to prevent this tragedy. 

Hamas, on the other hand, has been ruling Gaza since the last elections, 18 years ago. In a survey conducted in 2021, the authoritarian government received merely 30% approval from its population. It is hard to imagine that number not plummeting given the scope of this ongoing destruction, inclusive of innocent Palestinians. 

To imagine peace we must refrain from retributive impulses; we must wipe the slate clean. Mandela and Gandhi taught us the value of forgiveness in the spirit of humanizing the peace process. 

Let us see in this tragedy an opportunity to usher in new leadership‚Äîon both sides‚Äîand reinvent a diplomatic coexistence based on shared values of peace and prosperity for all. Concessions must be made and a commitment to teach love rather than hate. Because the guttural pain of loss hurts universally. And we must forgive before more deaths escalate. 

As Buddha teaches, holding onto anger Is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. We stand with Israel and innocent Palestinians. We stand with peace.

instagram,"As a wedding planner, I've long been captivated by the deep symbolism embodied in the chuppah. In these recent days, amid moments of shock and sorrow, I'm struck by how its significance resonates even more deeply. It stands not just as a testament to love but as a powerful symbol of hope and unity during this time of darkness.

With its delicate canopy, the chuppah serves as a sanctuary where two hearts become one, pledging to embark on a shared journey of love, understanding, and resilience. It is a physical manifestation of unity, a shelter under which vows are exchanged, dreams are woven, and futures are built. 

In this symbolic space, love blossoms, and hope thrives, reminding us of the unyielding strength of unity. Just as the chuppah represents the unbreakable bond between two individuals, we, too, can create a haven of compassion, empathy, and solidarity where the warmth of our hearts can conquer the darkness of despair. Amid the chaos, our love becomes the canopy under which we stand, unwavering and united. Like the threads of a tallit, prayers weave a tapestry of hope, resilience, and peace. 

We support Israel, our Jewish clients, colleagues, and friends, holding onto the strength of togetherness, just as the loving hands of the surrounding community uphold the pillars of a chuppah. Our steadfast support extends to all those affected by this tragic conflict, including the innocent civilians of Palestine. Our commitment echoes in our unwavering love and continuous prayers, and we unequivocally condemn and reject Hamas, terrorism, violence, and antisemitism. 

May the symbolism of the chuppah remind us that even in the face of adversity and deep despair, hope will shelter, love will prevail, and unity will triumph.

She adds, ""After three days, Facebook responded, stating that the post calling for the annihilation of Gaza and its inhabitants did not violate its standards.""

instagram,"As many of you know, I‚Äôve been studying the Enneagram for about 3.5 years now. One of my main sources of information is the awesome @twlahue videos on youtube. I watch them all the time! So, yesterday, I was watching his most recent video on the life of Enneagram 9‚Äôs and he repeated this line several times ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt have your conflicts externally, you‚Äôre going to have them internally.‚Äù And I LOVED that. It particularly applies to 9‚Äôs as they are conflict avoidant and thus end up having a lot of inner turmoil. And it‚Äôs really true if you think about it: what you don‚Äôt deal with externally lives inside of you and becomes an internal battle. Many 9‚Äôs I know deal with chronic anxiety and are not sure why. Their unexpressed emotions become physical ailments which can lead to long-lasting health problems. The problem is that everything lives inside of them due to this fear and avoidance of conflict. But as we know, conflict is a natural part of life. You cannot be a human in this world without it. And yes, sometimes that means having to face the conflict in the moment, externally, which will actually set you up for comfort in the long-term. 9‚Äôs look for comfort in the short-term but they have a blind spot as concerns how this resistance to anything unpleasant sets them up for a lot more discomfort later on. Anyway, food for thought for you 9‚Äôs and anyone else who is conflict avoidant! And also, shoutout to Dr. Tom LaHue! Who wants a collab with him? Dr. Tom?

instagram,"In response to the Middle East tensions, investors have turned to gold, which is considered a safe haven asset during uncertain times.

Hyderabad: Gold rates in Hyderabad have rebounded, reversing the declining trend of the past few days. This reversal in trend is attributed to the tensions in the Middle East region due to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

In response to the Middle East tensions, investors have turned to gold, which is considered a safe haven asset during uncertain times.

Current gold rates in Hyderabad
At present, the rates of gold in Hyderabad stand at Rs 54,000 for 10 grams of 22-carat gold and Rs 58,910 for 24-carat gold.

Recently, the price of gold hit a six-month low, with rates for 10 grams of 22-carat and 24-carat gold dropping to Rs 52,600 and Rs 57,380, respectively.

Although the price of gold has increased by over 2.6 percent from the six-month low, jewelry shops in Hyderabad are witnessing a rush, as many anticipate that prices may rise further.

Israel-Palestine Conflict
The recent tensions in the Middle East were sparked by Hamas attacks that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis and injuries to many.

In response to these attacks, Israel launched airstrikes against the Gaza Strip, claiming that the attacks were targeting Hamas infrastructure. These airstrikes have also resulted in the deaths of hundreds and injuries to many.

Due to the escalation of tension in the Middle East region, investors are concerned about volatility in global markets and have turned to gold, causing the rates of the yellow metal to rise not only in Hyderabad but also in other Indian cities and around the world.",,354,"{'like_count': 349, 'comment_count': 5, 'num_users': 53867}",Hyderabad News Insta,,2023-10-12 21:16:45,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/319075348_834526007636091_7251464161281060085_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=R4r92QhOFH8AX8ybzhW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBUWv5yaI--VZn078AXWvIXLy1ycFd4-VVPmaUaDLkuWQ&oe=655A8132,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyUENN1rV7W/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391426451_3562422200741394_6999119779607142469_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=jBcwZIF8upkAX8qNzHX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB12VqzpdeVlSsV54ntNUTZm4p0JBXJydzY7rw-l88aJQ&oe=652ED919
instagram,"Alex Younger, who served as the head of the UK's foreign intelligence service from 2014 to 2020, gave his comments in an interview on the BBC's ""The Today Podcast.""

It came after Hamas fighters stormed into Israel and massacred whole villages ‚Äî Israel has said more than 1,000 people were killed, including children and the elderly.

He said: ""I absolutely understand and endorse Israel's right to defend themselves in the circumstances, and indeed to restore the credibility of those defenses, so that that sense of psychological safety can be restored to the people.""

""But here's the thing, you shouldn't do what your enemy wants you to do,"" said Younger.

Israel launched waves of airstrikes on Gaza in the wake of the attacks, killing hundreds. It has massed troops on the border of the Gaza Strip and pledged to destroy Hamas in its entirety, but has yet to move in its troops. 

""And it's really obvious now that Hamas are essentially laying a trap for Israel,"" said Younger.

""And [it] will be well pleased if Israel commits itself to an open-ended, full-scale ground invasion of Gaza because of the scale and intensity of conflict that that would entail, and the loss of innocent life that would inevitably follow and the radicalization that would engender, and the extent to which will put Israel's allies and partners in the region in an impossible position.""

He said Hamas was likely surprised by how successful its mission had been, with militants successfully evading Israeli surveillance and breaking through Israel's high-tech border security before advancing around 30 kilometres into Israel. 

A senior Hamas official said much the same thing.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to destroy Hamas in the wake of the attacks. But analysts say that in invading Gaza, the densely populated region the militant group has governed since 2007, the IDF would face fierce resistance from Hamas, which is embedded in a network of underground tunnels and bases. Such an attack would likely result in the loss of thousands of civilian lives.",,347,"{'like_count': 339, 'comment_count': 8, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-12 18:43:33,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTyrOlArBL/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387739623_887315486067369_3000785327373436044_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=pJAOvl0ldF0AX_wvuEK&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCXG2DHsh9SGMFxFN1jG3D83t2m7hdns1W0y5Ycr-9BKQ&oe=652E6393

When: Wednesday, October 18, 6:00-8:00

On Saturday, October 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel. This has shaken the Israeli state, which has long been the most reactionary regime in the middle-east, to its core.
Israel has since declared a mass bombing campaign against Gaza, and has mobilized over 300‚Äô000 reservists, promising a mass ground campaign as well. Two million Palestinians live in Gaza, who will now be subjected to a mass terror campaign the likes of which has not been seen in modern times.
Western politicians and their capitalist media have rushed to support ‚Äú Israel‚Äôs right to self-defense‚Äù. Where were their concerns when Jenin was turned to rubble in July? Where were their harsh words when the al-Aqsa mosque was stormed by Israeli settlers just days ago? In fact, the imperialist powers around the world have allowed massacres against Palestinians for the past 75 years.
We stand with the oppressed people of Palestine in their struggle for liberation and a homeland.
A new generation of Palestinians reject the sham peace of the Oslo accords and are looking towards the revolutionary heritage of the first intifada. As Communists we stand firmly in opposition to imperialism and national oppression that is why we say: No to the invasion and bombing of Gaza! No to imperialist meddling or a capitalist ‚Äúpeace‚Äù! End the occupation! For a socialist federation of the whole of Palestine, as part of a socialist federation of the Middle East! Intifada until victory!
Join the communists for a discussion on how we as workers and students can help finally put an end to this bloody conflict.

MERCY Malaysia has been operating in Palestine since 2003, providing humanitarian assistance and development aid by providing medical support, food aid, clean water access, shelter, community development programmes, sustainable livelihood, education, and mental health and psychosocial support programs.

Over the years, MERCY Malaysia‚Äôs initiatives have manage to slightly reduce the affected people‚Äôs humanitarian burden, and help support them continue to live their life normally. However, the number of affected population and the needs for humanitarian, as well as development remains high in this conflict, which is one of the world‚Äôs longest continuing conflicts.

The relief aid distribution aimed to provide much-needed support to the people residing in the Gaza Strip, reaffirming MERCY Malaysia commitment to alleviating their suffering and promoting resilience within the community. Other live saving initiatives are being conducted, which include supply of medicines and providing fuels to operate ambulance as the conflict‚Äôs casualties have not been restricted to combatants, with a large number of civilian fatalities on both sides.

MERCY Malaysia is monitoring the humanitarian needs and impact, and looking at all possibilities to provide aid to support those in need of humanitarian assistance.

instagram,"Many people go through life trying to find that one perfect person who will fulfill their every desire. ‚Å†

That person will like the same things as you, believe the same things as you, handle conflict with such ease and grace, and basically be everything you‚Äôve ever wanted. Once you FIND that person, love will be easy... right?‚Å†

We get tricked by our Hollywood obsessed culture into believing that this is what worthwhile love is and if there are any differences, triggers, or conflicts then that person is NOT ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù I used to believe that too.üíî‚Å†

But compatibility is built. Differences can create balance. Our strengths are in different areas and I love that.

Real Love is teamwork. It‚Äôs being able to appreciate rather than resent differences. It‚Äôs always choosing to be on each other‚Äôs side, rather than always needing things to be seen and done YOUR way. ‚Å†
‚Å†
üëâLove is a practice.‚Å†
‚Å†
üëâLove is a skill.‚Å†
‚Å†
üëâLove is built. Love is built. Love is built.‚Å†

If you want to begin cultivating compatibility (instead of believing that it's something that's just there or not), join us for our new workshop, Loving the Person in Front of You on 10/24 @ 1pm PT.
Tickets are $55 USD and a replay will be sent out to all who register.

instagram,"I have posted some of these before but a few others in there. These are of Hebron in 2016. I was with Breaking the Silence, the ex-IDF whistleblower activist collective i keep referring to. I was so lucky to meet & get to know Palestinian activist @issaamro that evening (last photo). You can read all about him & his great work online. I was also so lucky to meet & get to know @oren_ziv who was with us that night, who is reporting on this current conflict as we speak. (He is co-founder of Activestills Collective‚Äîyou can read about him & them online too. ‚Äú It is composed of Israeli, Palestinian and international photographers, operating locally in Palestine/Israel and abroad.‚Äù) 

The old man in the photos is someone I do not feel lucky to know: David Wilder, who has for ages made himself a speaker for the settlers in that region. IDF had to step in David is so quick to instigate with hate. (He was born in NJ, by the way, you can read about him online. Many of the settlers are American!) I was on a cane & recovering from illness on that trip & they had to separate us. I never forgot how proud he was of his evil. @gavron another amazing Israeli, a genius writer, was with us too. 

This trip was clarifying for me. It cemented my hatred of the Occupation plus introduced me to a world of progressive Israelis I did not know well. They taught me a lot, just as the Palestinians did, and their views were very much in sync‚Äîjust as you will find in the US with allies who support just causes.

So I will forever denounce the violence of the settlers just like I will forever denounce the violence of Hamas. I will forever hate Netanyahu‚Äôs murderous regime just like I will forever hate Iran‚Äôs. I have no problem hating & denouncing those with blood on their hands. 

But where I will give most my energies is love. The people I will always fight for are these kids we met here, them & the families. I hope they are okay. I haven‚Äôt stopped praying for them for 7 years now. 

Naively perhaps I still hope they have a happier life than many of us.

instagram,"Here‚Äôs to being brave and unapologetically me üíúü•π 

Today is #nationalcomingoutday and I‚Äôve debated if I wanted to *publicly* announce that I am bisexual, but I remember seeing someone‚Äôs post a few years ago and I remember how much it inspired me and made me feel less alone.

Being a woman in a heterosexual marriage, I felt like my sexuality wasn‚Äôt valid because ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be with a woman‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre married to ben, so what‚Äôs the point of coming out now??‚Äù

I felt a lot of internal conflict, and it started to to impact my mental health. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being true to myself, afraid of what others would think, and just tired of holding in this *big secret*. 

Last year, I told my therapist (the first person ever) that I was bisexual. It felt SO freeing. The world didn‚Äôt end. My marriage didn‚Äôt crumbled. There was no scandal roaming the internet. 

In fact, it was the complete opposite. I felt unconditional love, support, and the ability to relate/talk with others who were in a similar situation. 

The only thing that changed was how confident and HAPPY I felt.

And I think the most important takeaway from therapy and supportive conversations is that my marriage to Ben doesn‚Äôt invalidate my sexuality. 

I liked girls before I met Ben (surprise!!), but Ben is the person I chose to marry and spend forever with ü•πüíñ and he has been the biggest supporter and husband!!

I‚Äôm still me (crazy cat lady, hopeless romantic, anxious girlie), just happier and honest with myself ü´∂üåà

Also, if this is your first time finding out, please don‚Äôt take offense. Its not easy to tell someone ‚Äúhey! I‚Äôm queer!‚Äù üò≠üòÖ and I hope you can understand üíñ

instagram,"The Abou Dan family was holed up at home, in the Bureij camp in the center of the Gaza Strip. Everyone kept checking their phones to make sure that no message had been sent from the Israeli army telling them to evacuate their home. 

""There was no warning shot, no text message, nothing. All of a sudden, a bomb fell, then two,"" said Ahmed Abou Dan over the phone. By late afternoon on Monday, October 9, Gaza had been under intensive bombardment by Israeli fighter planes for almost 24 hours. 

This 43-year-old Palestinian was the only survivor of his siblings who, as is often the case in Gaza, lived in the same building. His son, his father, his two brothers and part of their family were killed. Fourteen people in all, including four children and two teenagers. One of his nieces was pregnant.

""So far, I've buried 10 martyrs, but four are still under the rubble. I'm moving heaven and earth. We extracted my brother's family. But my son, Walid, 22, is still under the rubble, as is my niece Amira, 16, and one of the children of another niece ‚Äì he was 7, I think. Isn't it despicable to have killed them?"" he asked, his breath coming in angry gasps. 

27 people, including 15 minors, were killed on the day of the strike on the Abu Dan family's building in the Bureij camp and the surrounding localities, according to the count by Al-Mezan, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, and Al-Haq, three Palestinian human rights NGOs. 

Ahmed Abou Dan realized it was a miracle he had survived: ""It was very violent: The bombing destroyed our building, which is 35 meters high. Imagine a four-story building collapsing on you. I live on the third floor. Both walls fell on me. I was terrified. What can you feel at that moment? Fright. Fright! I recited my profession of faith.""

instagram,"To our supporters and community, 

The harsh realities of conflict and violence cannot be taken lightly - and when the storm arrives, Team Stott heads into the direction of the danger. 

And no, it never gets easier. 

This current conflict in Israel is no different. 

We received a call from a family that needed immediate support to safely evacuate from the country and get their family out safely. 

In a matter of hours, Dean was on a flight and we had 18 families needing help. 

The number has now grown and we are now in the 100s.. 

We are self-funding this initiative because we knew we had to help. 

We had to run into the danger and do what we do best. 

We need money for flights, ground moves, local support and supplies. 

Over the years supporting Dean in his missions, I've seen so many people try to take advantage of him. They would try to throw him into danger zones while they reaped the rewards and benefits. 

I quickly became known as the ""b*tch"" of Team Stott; I would constantly block these people because I knew they only saw him as a commodity. 

To this day, my gut on this matter has never failed us. 

And right now my gut is telling me to reach out to our community and ask for your help. 

As you know by now, Israel faced coordinated attacks leaving hundreds of lives lost, thousands displaced, and many taken hostage. 

We have former Special Forces Operators on the ground conducting humanitarian efforts, including evacuations, rescues and recoveries. 

We simply cannot do it alone and need your support to fund their efforts. 

Funding will pay for flights, supplies, ground moves and any other requirements to ensure safe repatriation. 

There is never a good explanation for this kind of atrocity going on in the world. But now is not the time to sit idly by. 

We need to join together and help more people. 

Now is the time to get involved and support our mission. Please give what you can on our SpotFund campaign so that we can save more people.

instagram,"BREAKING NEWS:
Stellantis and Korean battery powerhouse Samsung SDI have announced a joint venture to build a new $3.2 EV batter factory in Kokoma, Indiana.

WHAT HAPPENED:
This is actually the 2nd plant Stellantis and Samsung SDI are building together. effectively, the companies are more than doubling the production capacity of their first plant in Kokomo, Indiana. This second investment will get Kokomo up to around 67GWh of power produced every year. Depending on how you slice it, that's enough batteries for around 1 million EVs per year.

CURRENT STATUS:
This is a huge move that will give Stellantis a massive advantage moving forward. As an international company, Stellantis is getting hurt a little less by the ongoing UAW strikes. As such, they have the capital to make some big long-term investments right now. Lots of advanced battery manufacturers like Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution are clamoring to partner with American firms in order to get access to IRA tax breaks. With Ford pausing their own EV battery plant, Stellantis is getting out to a solid lead here.

WHY IT MATTERS:
This announcement is going to make things a lot messier for Stellantis as they move forward with the negotiations they're having with the UAW. The autoworker's union announced a huge deal where a big GM battery plant will be staffed with UAW workers last week. Battery plants and pensions are a big part of the UAW's ongoing negotiations, so this announcement just opened up an entirely new front in the conflict between the UAW and Stellantis. For now, Stellantis still has enough comparative advantage to like this deal. Both Stellantis and Samsung SDI stock rose on the announcement.

instagram,"As travelers, we arrive in places, sometimes with a knowledge of historical context and sometimes severely lacking it. Whether we have traveled long distances and to many countries, or just to a few places, we are citizens of not just our home countries but of the world around us.

It‚Äôs why we believe it is our responsibility as a community of travelers to speak up when we can; to use our voices to help others around us.

The history of conflict between Israel & Palestine has started long before our own lives. Some may tell us that this means we cannot or should not comment on what is happening, or form opinions. That our role as travelers is to accept things, listen, and be silent.

But there are things that we should all stand for, and speak against.

Ripping children from the arms of their parents and kidnapping them is not okay.
Lighting homes on fire is not okay.
The destruction of peaceful places of worship is not okay.
Sexual assault is not okay.
Murder and violence are not okay.
Taking hostages and endangering innocent lives is not okay.

We mourn for our Israeli friends who are fearing for their lives and their families, for the many who have been killed, and for the others who have unexpectedly been called to fight. 

We mourn for our Palestinian friends whose homes have been obliterated in Gaza, who have lost their lives in air strikes, and who are running low on life-saving resources.

We mourn the many years of desperate and passionate conflict that have led to this moment and many other violent moments before.

We believe in the importance of difficult dialogue, especially in impossible situations. In finding solutions that can create peace rather than destroy each other.

We beg for the violence to stop in Israel and Palestine, and around the world.

Our hearts ache knowing this pain and suffering is happening. As @valariekaur  stated, ‚ÄúThis is not about equivalency. The time has come to center the human cost of the conflict above all.‚Äù",,263,"{'like_count': 263, 'comment_count': 0, 'num_users': 19620}",Wanderful¬Æ,,2023-10-12 12:00:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11049426_1559661334287283_585218402_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=td8rkQheVvsAX_7SnrU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB0GkUvb3pWtyRK69So9U6JD1OY7d2OPG5NFZ8WjnOB-Q&oe=6559BD15,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTEmHXrF6f/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391691622_715250917304003_466767359706825619_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=3L6FZoOmOrsAX-TK_LP&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAcqnUNnQ-ik-b3A6PPBqAPML2K6-fdLjPwGNE8nj2GKg&oe=655B2B6C
instagram,"Korean Air said Thursday it plans to deploy a temporary flight to Dubai this week to transport Koreans in Israel, who have fled to the nearby United Arab Emirates city due to the Middle Eastern conflict, back home.

The company said it will send an A330-200 aircraft to Dubai from Incheon International Airport on Friday to transport the group of Koreans who have recently traveled from Tel Aviv to Dubai by land.

The group traveled to Dubai after the company's Incheon-bound flights from Tel Aviv were canceled following the outbreak of the armed conflict between Hamas and Israel. The Dubai-Incheon flight is scheduled to arrive in Korea early Saturday.

Korean Air has canceled its flights connecting Incheon and Tel Aviv this week amid safety concerns over the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas that broke out Saturday.

instagram,"The eclipse portal is highly active now as we experience the first Libra Solar Eclipse since 2005, which highlights sharing, cooperation, relationship dynamics, communications, and how you resolve conflict in valuable connections. 

The Sun and Moon will create a Ring of Fire Solar Eclipse on October 14 at 21 degrees Libra, and then move to the South Node in Libra, along with Mercury. 

Mercury opposes Chiron RX exactly, triggering potentially hurtful words or conversations that require resolution. 

Mars enters Scorpio on October 11 and immediately trines Saturn RX in Pisces, revealing what you‚Äôre truly feeling and how to own it responsibly. 

A powerful turnover is underway, and it‚Äôs a beautiful time to be highly self-observant of where you‚Äôre ready to improve, be better, or truly hear the energy that is coming through you now.

instagram,"ALL THIS WEEK, whilst people who profess to be of faith have sat in almighty judgement (with ZERO knowledge of works being undertaken behind the scenes with people of all faiths to stem more tides of ignorant, blind hate), beautiful souls continue to shine out from amidst the rubble & horror...

Friends of all faiths, met on my travels through the Holy Land just over 3 years ago, have been checking in, reaching out, and sharing the horrors they witnessed and must now survive.

One such piece of my heart is a Muslim teacher & mother I met in #Palestine - who is fearful her parents have been killed in the latest bombings & is also now having trouble breathing. 

Another is a Jewish grandfather in #Israel, who has spent 15 years secretly driving Palestinians stopped at checkpoints to hospitals, to ensure they were treated. One of his grandchildren is now missing.

Another is an Arab Christian, who is trying to aid anyone he can, at great risk to his own life. He hasn't been in touch for 2 days now, so am praying he's OK.

They are just three of many who bless my worlds. 

None of them supports any atrocity, injustice, or invasion committed in their name against others. No matter who is committing them or why.

In this supposed chess board of black and white, humans aren't.

One group who changed everything for me was the @theparentscircle. I travelled especially to learn of and meet with them, forged as they are of  Palestinian and Israeli parents who have each lost children to this conflict, and who refuse to let the world ""take revenge"" in the names of their children.

S/Heroes, every one.

And every day this week, despite the pain, fear, horror, headlines, sirens, bombs, & fury, every one of these friends, no matter what is happening around them, has been ending their messages to me with some form of: ""Am praying for everyone innocent on the other side. Wish they knew.""

So I'm letting you know.

That beyond the shattering headlines, words baying for dehumanisation and division, and lines drawn in man-made quicksand, are souls who will never bow to hate. Or any justification of it.

And therein lies hope.

As you were. X

The situation prompted heightened efforts, while Israeli forces remained uncertain about the source of Syrian-fired shells.

instagram,"Congrats to @reelguyana on the launch of their excellent new documentary the March onwards. The launch was held today at @movietowneguyana and examines the impact of farming development on the warrau who depend on crabs that dwell among the mangroves of the Barima Mora Passage in region 1. The Mangroves need to be felled in order to clear land for farming which causes the crabs to move. This migration makes it harder for the crabs to be caught by the Warrua thus affecting their livelihood. 

The film examines this conflict along with possible solutions including alternative means of income for the communities. 

It officially premiers across Guyana on the 15th October at 6:00 PM on all Reel Guyana channels. 

Visit Guyana is very proud of the work done by Alex Arjune and his sister Victoria and their team and is happy to support it. 

The March onwards is a gripping documentary that is heartfelt, honest and moving. Using stunning filmmaking and authentic storytelling, the documentary beautifully captures the essence of the changes along the Barima mora passage through the voices of the people who live there. Well done.

instagram,"Donald Trump is drawing criticism from the White House and Republican presidential rival Ron DeSantis over comments on the conflict in Israel days after the deadly attack by Hamas.

At a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump said Hamas would never have carried out the assault under his watch and condemned the violence that was mostly inflicted on Israeli civilians.

Yet the former president also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not joining him in a 2020 drone strike in Iraq that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and called Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group that has been designated as a terrorist organization by the US, ‚Äúvery smart.‚Äù

DeSantis responded with a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, saying he would ‚Äústand with Israel and treat terrorists like the scum that they are‚Äù as president. Tap the link in bio for more.

instagram,"MUST READ. 

Due to recent events, I want to take the next few days to introduce you to some books I would recommend about Hamas, Israel, and the Israeli/Palestine conflict. 

Synopsis: ‚ÄúSon of Hamas is now available with an all-new chapter about events since the book‚Äôs release such as the revelation of Mosab‚Äôs Israeli intelligence handler‚Äôs true identity, and Homeland Security‚Äôs effort to deport the author.
Since he was a small boy, Mosab Hassan Yousef has had an inside view of the deadly terrorist group Hamas. The oldest son of Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a founding member of Hamas and its most popular leader, young Mosab assisted his father for years in his political activities while being groomed to assume his legacy, politics, status . . . and power. But everything changed when Mosab turned away from terror and violence, and embraced instead the teachings of another famous Middle East leader. In Son of Hamas, Mosab reveals new information about the world‚Äôs most dangerous terrorist organization and unveils the truth about his own role, his agonizing separation from family and homeland, the dangerous decision to make his newfound faith public, and his belief that the Christian mandate to ‚Äúlove your enemies‚Äù is the only way to peace in the Middle East.‚Äù",,227,"{'like_count': 221, 'comment_count': 6, 'num_users': 5668}",Conservative Books,,2023-10-12 00:03:50,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/120483504_102092064972716_1894681342748961774_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=UaumwzGgH4gAX9bM9gL&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfA_tOj8v0SPEayxKE4F5tP8EKXsquOsjaYTyHUonqXfHg&oe=655AB6B8,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRyiGxNBNJ/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387697891_1077334620387982_9680323234733270_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=O9_2Lmz1LqwAX_0LnVq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBuoy56izWJBoypz0LWDJUSKIS-tziV7UQyN4xBjAp3xQ&oe=655AA49F
instagram,"Robert ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Zaval of North Huntingdon, saw the horrors of war as an Army tank commander fighting in Europe during World War II.

‚ÄúBoy, it was tough. Your biggest thing was to stay alive,‚Äù said Zaval, who recently reflected on his long life before marking his 102nd birthday on Tuesday.

Like many other combat veterans, he does not consider himself a hero. He survived battles in Belgium, Holland, France, Germany and Yugoslavia.

‚ÄúThe real heroes are the ones who are still over there ‚Ä¶ who never came home,‚Äù Zaval said.

Zaval is one of a dwindling breed. Of the more than 16 million Americans who served in the military during World War II, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs estimates that only about 120,000 remain alive eight decades after the end of the conflict. Of the Pennsylvanians who served during that war, only about 7,030 were alive this year, according to the VA.

Zaval remains in the modest home he built on Lincoln Way, which he shares with his wife, Helene. He remains mentally sharp and uses a wheelchair to get around.

Zaval, who shortened his name from Zavalydriga, is the father of three children.

Zaval entered the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù after graduating from Norwin High School in 1939, part of the nation‚Äôs last class of high school graduates before war broke out in Europe in September 1939. With America on the sidelines of the conflict between Nazi Germany and England and France, Zaval landed a job as a steelworker at Fort Pitt Steel Casting Co. in McKeesport.

Anti-war sentiment grew in some segments of society, with an America First movement against any involvement in Europe‚Äôs war, but Zaval was not so certain the country would not be dragged into conflict.

‚ÄúI thought we would get involved,‚Äù Zaval said.

instagram,"PBBM VOWS FULL SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES OF PINOYS KILLED IN ISRAEL

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday, Oct. 12, vowed full government assistance for the families of two Filipinos who were killed during the assault of Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel.
 
The Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said President Marcos spoke with the grieving families of the victims via a phone call on Wednesday to personally extend his condolences.
 
‚ÄúMahirap itong nangyari sa‚Äôyo. Lahat ng assistance na kailangan mo gagawin ng gobyerno. Lahat ‚Ä¶ Pati ‚Äòyung pagbalik sa bangkay‚Ä¶ at pagka magkaroon ng chance, magulo pa rin kasi at nagbobombahan pa‚Ä¶‚Äù the president told one of the relatives of the victims during the phone conversation.
 
The President advised the relatives to be in constant contact with the Philippine embassy in Tel Aviv for an update in the situation there.
 
In a message posted on his social media account, the chief exectuive admitted that talking with the grieving relatives was ‚Äúthe most difficult task‚Äù he had to make as President.
 
‚ÄúLast (Wednesday) night, I made two of the most difficult phone calls I‚Äôve had to make as President. The nation is one in grieving with the families of the Filipinos who were killed in the attacks on Israel,‚Äù he said.
 
‚ÄúWe will provide the utmost support to the families they were taken from,‚Äù the President said. ‚ÄúThis tragedy will not deter our spirit. We will continue to stand for peace.‚Äù
 
President Marcos also assured that the government is doing all it can to ensure the welfare and well-being of Filipinos in Israel amid the ongoing conflict.
 
He likewise said that government officials are preparing to facilitate the repatriation of those who want to return to the Philippines.
 
The Philippine consulate earlier described one of the victims as a 33-year-old married female from Pangasinan who has been working in Israel for six years. The other victim is a 42-year-old male from Pampanga. ‚Äì RRD",,214,"{'like_count': 211, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 118432}",UNTV News and Rescue,,2023-10-12 07:40:08,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/298329121_1242299579880757_3315446861567386076_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ooavrpmtUHEAX83rMla&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB9dEIK7OhZTK8Z2qjvoj2u84lKvfh5dIEYs9G_0C9hgA&oe=655A3B6B,https://www.instagram.com/p/CySmwEDNgAu/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/391617090_724201406415257_4390243321128416622_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=vLoEVulMQlEAX_UaK_Z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBMJNRUASGwTQUXmmsthLqQFf8CeTppGpeFTq93xyl4_g&oe=65312743

Do not let anyone pressure you into speaking on this if you don‚Äôt want to (or to not speak on this if you do want to for that matter). Frankly it‚Äôs also important to remember this conflict isn‚Äôt going to be solved by Westerners sharing infographics and hot takes on social media. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be solved by Israelis and Palestinians (probably with mediation from international powers). Unfortunately any solution seems very very very far away right now.

‚ÄúGive to us peace in our time, O Lord.‚Äù

Each day, we read about new horrors in relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. With both sides choosing to continue to escalate the conflict with violent rhetoric and increasingly violent military action, I urge all parties involved to negotiate a ceasefire and work to allow diplomatic solutions to prevail. A peaceful resolution must be given every possible chance to succeed. Innocent people in Israel and Gaza cannot afford more bloodshed.

Peace is the fruit of justice and requires solidarity among peoples and nations. Escalations of violence only increase suffering and make diplomatic resolutions harder to achieve. 

It is time to stop the killing and work towards peace for our time.

This current conflict is the most challenging time for Israel in more than a generation, especially given the complex layers added when you consider the 150 hostages being held in Gaza. It may take weeks for Israel to vanquish this threat, but we are confident the nation will emerge victorious.

instagram,"This week we have reviewed what signs of compatibility look like, so now here are 3 reasons you should not base it off of early love chemistry you may experience.

Your brain is flooded with feel good neurotransmitters like dopamine and noradrenaline.

You have a decrease in serotonin that can create obsessive ruminative thoughts.

You have an increase in DHEA, which creates a natural high.

It is important to not judge love on this initial spark because it will fade.

Instead look at the commonalities and similarities you share and determine if you can build something together.

‚ÄúNapakasakit, hindi ko matanggap. Kahit na sinong magulang hindi matatanggap na mawawalan sila ng anak,‚Äù Angelyn‚Äôs mother Erlinda shared in an interview with GMA Regional TV One North Central Luzon.¬†

She added that no words could explain how much pain they were in and how much they are missing their beloved daughter. ¬†

They last got in touch with Angelyn on Oct. 6, with the OFW saying how she has been worrying about the ongoing war.¬†

On Oct. 9, Angelyn's death was confirmed by her sister Angenica who has also been working in Israel.

instagram,"CHRISTIAN CONFLICT - THE PERILS OF PRIDE.

Pride and Haughtiness... 

The word haughty is defined by Merriam-Webster as ‚Äúblatantly and disdainfully proud.‚Äù The word is always used in The Bible in the evil sense of ‚Äúarrogant, disdainful and setting oneself above others‚Äù, it is often set in contrast to being humble.

When we are haughty, we become the center of our universe, everything revolves around us. There is little, if any, concern for what others think and no consideration to and of the will of God. Pride, haughtiness, is the trunk of the tree from which all other sins sprout. When we are at the center of our world, then nothing that we want is unlawful to us.

God is resistant to haughtiness. Over and over in Scripture, we read that God brings down the haughty and the proud (2 Samuel 2:28; Psalm 18:27; Isaiah 2:11, 5:15; Ezekiel 16:50). Twice in Proverbs, we read that haughtiness precedes destruction (16:18, 18:12). The New Testament is clear on the dangers of arrogance, warning repeatedly against it. Both James and Peter warn that God actively opposes the proud (James 4:6, 1 Peter 5:5).

The Bible tells us those who are arrogant and have a haughty heart are an abomination to Him: ‚ÄúEvery one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.‚Äù (Proverbs 16:5).

There are two Greek forms of the word arrogance used in the New Testament, essentially meaning the same. Huperogkos means ‚Äúswelling‚Äù or ‚Äúextravagant‚Äù as used in ‚Äúarrogant words‚Äù (2 Peter 2:18; Jude 1:16). The other is phusiosis, meaning a ‚Äúpuffing up of the soul‚Äù or ‚Äúloftiness, pride‚Äù (2 Corinthians 12:20). It is incumbent upon believers to recognize that being arrogant or having a pompous attitude is antithetical to godliness (2 Peter 1:5-7). Arrogance is nothing more than an overt display of one‚Äôs sense of self-importance (2 Timothy 3:2). It is akin to that ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about me‚Äù mindset that says, ‚ÄúThe world revolves around me‚Äù (Proverbs 21:24).üî•üö®üì¢",,180,"{'like_count': 179, 'comment_count': 1, 'num_users': 42471}",PRAYER WARRIOR FOR CHRIST!!,,2023-10-12 06:41:13,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/100957018_884715815328132_4028303879081820160_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=crqA3QX8FIoAX9Yur61&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBtpg5qXIFkHdETbcXb36-hcMrGSUIGHBn4FZxL7BdKKA&oe=655B2E07,https://www.instagram.com/p/CySgAscuXo1/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391416749_712013370959112_8208903703012650016_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=amTjYT15btkAX_OoEKZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCoJJoRDwWvFEG7-viJfDo2CHVQmOVJYnGNI9IVsHV7Lw&oe=6532A8FE

instagram,"The ""alienation industry"" is the dark underbelly of the family court system it's a lucrative industry. We will shine a light into the darkness and provide a pathway for those who find themselves trapped in the predictable but disturbing pipeline.

From the National Safe Parents Organization, ""The term ""parental alienation"" or ""parental alienation syndrome (PAS)"" was created by Richard Gardner in 1985 for the purpose of deflecting the court's attention from child abuse claims against fathers. This is a debunked concept, based on Gardner's clinical observations, not scientific data, and is not recognized by the United Nations (UN), American Psychiatric Association (APA), the World Health Organization (WHO) or the American Medical Association. Prior to his suicide, Gardner was an unpaid part time clinical professor of child psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. He made his money mainly as a forensic expert on a foundation of disturbing views, discrediting women and children on the basis of his debunked parental alienation theories.‚Äù

The seeds planted by Gardner have grown into a lucrative cottage industry, perpetuated by unscrupulous professionals who are profiting off childhood trauma, much of which they are creating. Once a child is placed in the ‚Äúalienation pipeline,‚Äù it is a very predictable journey and often ends with the child being forced into traumatizing reunification therapy or worse, reunification camp. www.alienationindustry.com

instagram,"Slow economic development has been a chronic and difficult concern for many countries throughout the world in recent years. When an economy's pace of expansion falls below its historical average or fails to reach its full potential, this phenomenon happens.

Slow economic growth can result in a reduced standard of living for the population. When an economy fails to expand at a sufficient rate, incomes may stagnate, and opportunities for advancement become limited.

Additionally, sluggish economic growth often translates into higher unemployment rates and underemployment, as businesses may be less inclined to hire or expand during uncertain economic conditions.

And of course, governments may face fiscal challenges as tax revenues stagnate while social spending needs rise. This can lead to budget deficits and, in some cases, unsustainable levels of debt, amongst other macroeconomic complexities such as political and social unrest.

According to the World Bank's September Africa Pulse report, economic activity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is expected to slow further from 3.6 percent in 2022 to 2.5 percent in 2023, a 0.6 percentage point decrease from the April 2023 prediction.

According to the research, 28 of the 48 Sub-Saharan African countries' growth predictions for 2023 have been revised lower.

Some of the factors that have contributed to the downward trend include monetary and fiscal policy tightness in response to high inflation and fiscal unsustainability, high risk of debt distress, structural constraints such as energy and transportation bottlenecks, and rising conflict and violence manifested in a series of events such as coup d‚Äô√©tats, protests, and heightened social unrest across Sub-Saharan African countries.

While some countries have managed to thrive and record impressive economic growth in 2023 so far, some have not been so fortunate. Based on the report, here are the top 10 African countries with the lowest economic growth in 2023 so far",,178,"{'like_count': 162, 'comment_count': 16, 'num_users': 166528}",Business Insider Africa,,2023-10-12 14:23:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/323917728_669588758296961_9094791412373829780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fZQ_TZXfWn8AX_BoFHx&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDbZtRC4Cxb3FQPKwEkvAWhIUA2U3aZsbgHcT_5VqYPMw&oe=655AC80D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTU9uWoB5S/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391077868_700684388277504_7194756533817297544_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=GrrY4k9HqCgAX8v6PMO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB8i8D1E0zUZuXS0AdiD_p-OVF76nGlnxjPP1JdYlhTJQ&oe=6542DE4B

instagram,"""Things are going pear-shaped quite fast for Pakistan. At the time of writing, it is not clear how intense the real war in Gaza is going to be and how far its fallout will travel. But the moment feels a little like the days between Sept 11 and October 7, 2001.

That was when the Americans were gearing up for a war that was to last two decades, and reshape the world in important ways. There should be little doubt that the conflict in Gaza will have a far-reaching impact as well which is difficult to envision at this time, given the uncertainty.

This matters greatly for Pakistan. The first such war initiated by the Americans impacted our country directly because we were a front-line state. That war brought financial inflows the likes of which previous military rulers could only dream about. It gave the economy a historic boost.""

Wearing @jespere.co during our recent trip truly redefined the way I wear my jewellery üíé . When I travel, I generally have to spend a lot of time matching my day & night outfits with my jewellery. With a set of J‚Äôesp√®re Co earrings, I can easily mix and match the pieces to complement any occasion and outfit during my travels.

To match with the beautiful backdrop of H·ªôi An and Da Nang, I wore the Tomorrow Collection(Blue) that consist of Sapphire Studs(Blue), Solaris(Blue) and Duo(Blue). The studs can be wore alone or with either one or both of the other two pieces. The versatility that comes with it truly allows me to mix and match them with my travel outfits at ease. 

Besides the versatility of J‚Äôesp√®re Co pieces, I also adore their awareness towards sustainability. The lab grown gemstones are all conflict-free and do not exhaust Mother Nature. Meanwhile, the gold used in the pieces are also made from vermeil recycled gold. These pieces are definitely guilty-free long lasting consumptions.

I look forward to styling them in different ways during my upcoming travels ‚úàÔ∏è . Stay tuned.

instagram,"Slow economic development has been a chronic and difficult concern for many countries throughout the world in recent years. When an economy's pace of expansion falls below its historical average or fails to reach its full potential, this phenomenon happens.

Slow economic growth can result in a reduced standard of living for the population. When an economy fails to expand at a sufficient rate, incomes may stagnate, and opportunities for advancement become limited.

Additionally, sluggish economic growth often translates into higher unemployment rates and underemployment, as businesses may be less inclined to hire or expand during uncertain economic conditions.

And of course, governments may face fiscal challenges as tax revenues stagnate while social spending needs rise. This can lead to budget deficits and, in some cases, unsustainable levels of debt, amongst other macroeconomic complexities such as political and social unrest.

According to the World Bank's September Africa Pulse report, economic activity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is expected to slow further from 3.6 percent in 2022 to 2.5 percent in 2023, a 0.6 percentage point decrease from the April 2023 prediction.

According to the research, 28 of the 48 Sub-Saharan African countries' growth predictions for 2023 have been revised lower.

Some of the factors that have contributed to the downward trend include monetary and fiscal policy tightness in response to high inflation and fiscal unsustainability, high risk of debt distress, structural constraints such as energy and transportation bottlenecks, and rising conflict and violence manifested in a series of events such as coup d‚Äô√©tats, protests, and heightened social unrest across Sub-Saharan African countries.

While some countries have managed to thrive and record impressive economic growth in 2023 so far, some have not been so fortunate. Based on the report, here are the top 10 African countries with the lowest economic growth in 2023 so far",,171,"{'like_count': 160, 'comment_count': 11, 'num_users': 2210965}",Pulse Ghana,,2023-10-12 14:23:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/273722299_343718550981422_7860594576092213462_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=0fwYEzQtdiQAX8welaT&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCdcByrqowtyfy9ra4sB2TAcSTjt7Msk8Gj3HQLDGetgg&oe=6559BDF9,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTU9uWoB5S/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/391077868_700684388277504_7194756533817297544_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=KTUHs7HNmxEAX8JgItF&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAmCzvOu1WyN3DuX21kk755987gZ6Gdolzk6WaBb9CbpA&oe=652F17CB

instagram,"good morning! Over the past 72 hours I‚Äôve been doing a lot of posting. In an effort to do something more materially beneficial I‚Äôve started a fundraising campaign for a reputable charitable organization called the Palestinian Children‚Äôs Relief Fund, who works directly with Palestinian youths who require medical attention and counseling. Roughly half of the population of Gaza is under 15 years old. That‚Äôs about a million children currently under siege by the Israeli military, ostensibly as payback for drastic actions taken by Hamas. No matter how YOU, the privileged American, feel about the conflict there are several undeniable, fully verifiable facts. Israel is bombing the border with Egypt, preventing the outflow of Palestinians at the border, those whom Netanyahu himself instructed to leave before the siege began. They are also restricting incoming aid caravans which are stuck on the opposite side of the border, under threat of bombing. Urgent need is present for the children of Gaza, who are being killed and injured in record numbers as Israel rains bombs and white phosphorus from the sky, leveling apartment buildings, schools, and municipal buildings - civilian targets. The time to stand up is now. If you do not wish to use your voice, then choose to use your wallet. Also give me your parents‚Äô phone number and I‚Äôll argue about Palestine on your behalf. 

Every direct donation to the fundraising link in my profile will be rewarded with a free digital download of ‚ÄúBee Side Beats 2: For Gaza‚Äù this coming Monday. Featuring exclusive beats and b-sides from some of the regrettably few vocally pro-Palestinian voices in DIY. If you‚Äôd like to be a part of the compilation please DM. Otherwise just share the freakin link please. Link in story and bio. Thank you for reading and for your generosity!

instagram,"In order to understand events - as the one now in Gaza and Israel - it is very important always to return to the origin, that is, the inception of this conflict. For those of us who believe in art's ability to save us, Jane Frere's @janegfrere renowned installation the ""Return of the Soul: The Nakba Project ,"" (2007-2008) is a perfect example. This work consists of approximately seven thousand miniature human figures representing the Nakba catastrophe, that is, the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948. Each wax figure is the same light yellow color, but they diminish in size (from twenty-two centimeters to half a centimeter), creating the illusion of a crowd receding into the distance. They are all suspended by transparent nylon from the roof of the gallery and face the same way. These figures were not made by Frere; instead, she taught Palestinian art groups how to make them in a series of workshops in refugee camps. The installation is accompanied by written testimonies and audio and video recordings of interviews with families expelled during the establishment of the state of Israel. These are accounts of loss, fear, and hope of return. Frere‚Äôs installation gives voice to these stories but also presents the essential emergency that has been concealed by their silence: the ongoing denial of the ethnic cleansing. The Nakba is still not recognized as a major historical event, even though Palestinians are still suffering its consequences in refugee camps throughout the Middle East. Let‚Äôs hope this violence will end today, now!

This incredible book highlights over 125 women and teens generously sharing our wisdom, insight, and secrets to taking on the world. These deeply personal stories aim to inspire the next wave of young leaders. By lifting one another's voices, we can reaffirm every girl's right to dream big, believe in herself, and decide her own future.
¬†
I'm humbled to be one of the contributors, with my story ""Becoming your own Superhero"" found on page 180.
¬†
One of my favorite lines I wrote was, ""Crying won't make us weak. It will clear the path of the pain to continue pursuing our dreams, to become your own superhero.""
And today, I had to give myself a moment to wrap myself in those words.
I have felt helpless, watching with horror and feeling grief for the current unfair situation for countless women and girls in Israel and Gaza.
And I prayed, stayed silent, and let my tears flow; I surrendered to hope and faith for better and brighter days ahead.
¬†
I hope you'll join me in supporting the organizations I‚Äôm attaching on the pics helping women and girls affected by the conflict. 
Let's turn our tears into action and our dreams into reality for girls everywhere.

instagram,"Prada ü§é (kruising springer spaniel/stafford, teefje, 6 maand) 

Prada, kruising springer spaniel/stafford, kwam bij ons binnen via een inbeslagname, samen met haar mama. Ze zit momenteel in een opvanggezin.

Het opvanggezin beschrijft Prada als zijnde een actieve puber. Ze is lief, enthousiast en een grote knuffelkont. Ze geniet van de buitenlucht, loopt graag rond in de tuin tussen de andere honden (bordercollies) en vond snel haar plaatsje in het gezin. Ze is intussen zindelijk geworden, gaat zelf naar buiten om haar behoeftes te doen. Een ongelukje ‚Äôs nachts is wel nog mogelijk. 

Alleen blijven is toch wel een probleem. Het is dan ook erg belangrijk gericht kauwmateriaal (bijvoorbeeld olijfwortelstok, een oude schoen, ‚Ä¶) achter te laten waar ze mee kan spelen. 

üê∂ Prada wordt bij voorkeur geplaatst als enige hond. Ze begrijpt de signalen die de andere honden geven niet altijd, durft hierbij ook uitdagen en zal een conflict niet uit de weg gaan. 
üê±üê∞ Er zijn ook katten in het gezin: hierbij is het opletten geblazen. Daarom plaatsen we Prada bij voorkeur in een gezin zonder katten. 
üë∂ Prada houdt NIET van kinderen: ze blaft ernaar en drijft ze in een hoekje. Bij het uitstrekken van een hand bijvoorbeeld, zal ze ernaar happen. 

üëâ Prada is een jonge puber die nog heel wat kan bijleren. Hiervoor zal heel wat tijd en geduld ge√Ønvesteerd dienen te worden. Daarom zoeken wij adoptanten, zonder kinderen, en bij voorkeur ook zonder andere dieren, die het grootste deel van de dag, bij haar kunnen zijn en haar liefdevol en met duidelijke regels en afspraken kunnen opvoeden. Prada zal zich dan verder ontwikkelen als een fantastisch hondje die zich ‚Äôs avonds, knus naast (op) u zal installeren om mee te genieten van de huiselijke sfeer.

üíå  Interesse?

instagram,"the five of cups can be a tough card to see. so many RWS-based interpretations view this card as only overwhelming grief, devastation, an inability to process hard feelings or move beyond loss. and indeed, fives in general are associated with friction and conflict, with breakthroughs that may require us to move beyond something established and safe. yet five also represents freedom, adventure, being true to the self. the suit of cups is not only about the hardest emotions we can think of. and with the five of cups, as @thetarotlady so generously reminds us in her new book the cards you‚Äôre dealt, ‚Äúwhat seems like failure may be an overlooked opportunity.‚Äù sometimes we simply need to broaden our perspective. 
.
the sun as a clarifying card both confirms and deepens this message. as an archetype the sun is both generous and restorative, a reminder that even if things feel hard right now, there are powerful shifts at work. what is brightening? what is revealing itself? what are you discovering, embracing, integrating? what unexpected changes in relationships or emotions are actually creating opportunities for pleasure, connection, deeper joy?
.
today, show yourself kindness, even if part of your mind or heart keeps whispering that you don‚Äôt deserve it. the world is hard enough without us being cruel to ourselves, too. how can you hold space for difficult emotions? how can you accept support when it‚Äôs offered? how can you celebrate the victories and progress you‚Äôve made, even if you aren‚Äôt fully finished yet? and in grieving the loss of human life, the callous ways that so many marginalized groups are treated in the united states and around the world, how can you commit to kindness, generosity, and empathy whenever possible?

instagram,"The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution calling on the governments of the 5 Council of Europe members to fully investigate all cases of the use of ‚ÄúPegasus‚Äù and other spy programs and provide information on them within three months.
Azerbaijan, Poland, Hungary, Greece and Spain are among the five members mentioned in the resolution.
Citing a series of journalistic and research projects that revealed and confirmed the use of ‚ÄúPegasus‚Äù, ‚ÄúCandiru‚Äù and ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù spyware by these countries, the PACE mandated ""immediately and fully investigate all cases of spyware abuse, punish any findings and provide compensation to victims.""
The resolution states that there is sufficient evidence that Azerbaijan used the ‚ÄúPegasus‚Äù spying program in connection with the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict against a number of people working in Armenia, including an Armenian government official.

As a reminder, in May of this year, the joint investigation of human rights organizations and IT security specialists showed that at least 13 Armenian public figures and officials, including journalists and human rights defenders, became target of the ‚ÄúPegasus‚Äù spy program.
The use of secret spying programs against political opponents, government officials, journalists, human rights defenders and civil society is a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Given the proliferation of such programs, the resolution reaffirms PACE's position that states should use these programs only ""in exceptional situations as a last resort"" and should avoid exporting these programs to countries where there is a significant risk that they will be used for repression or human rights abuses.",,153,"{'like_count': 150, 'comment_count': 3, 'num_users': 34922}",Akoonk Media,,2023-10-12 14:45:39,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/353978286_711794234047743_4590842855985201445_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=dpoMfdxlmjIAX9U6Lu1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfCmzKCwv-YZPx9qfkVN2BIDBFKq6aR22DGmRFVROAEdkA&oe=655B723D,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTXctwIPdY/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/387694322_1772721873198997_8364840145399719572_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=lWmPVWvPZXAAX_db2mn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDvCK___8QGsC6mPBAR4WIzImC-9kdVhCuqrNFTsKi16A&oe=6532716F

Someone asked me why I always want to stay positive rather than just accepting virtual reality as it is. They labeled it as delusional. To me, life can be brutal, and things don't always go the right way. Life can be unfair for many of us; look at the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. It breaks my heart every day, and reading the news can be terrifying. Life has the power to shatter us at any moment.

If we have a choice, I choose happiness and positivity. It's up to you how you choose to see life, but let's stop making excuses, pointing fingers, and dwelling on negativity. We might not control what happens to us, but we have the power to control how we react to it, to adapt, and even to find opportunities within challenges. Let's stop using excuses to justify bitterness and avoid labeling others as ‚Äútoxic positive‚Äù I'm no longer allowing negative people to influence my life; I've had enough! ü•≤üòÑ I proudly declare that I choose to embrace my happiness. üëãüëãüëãüé∂ü§∑üèª‚ù§Ô∏è

Israel's collective punishment, characterized by cutting off basic human needs, threatens to escalate an already devastating situation.

Has your partner ever been spiraling and you just have no idea what to say? Or on the flip side, have you been spiraling and your partner just said the absolute wrong thing? The important thing is to strike a balance between validating support, and offering grounding into the present. Minimizing the feelings doesn‚Äôt work well (Stop worrying! This doesn‚Äôt matter!) and condescending doesn‚Äôt either (You‚Äôre ridiculous, *exasperated sigh*). However, you CAN suggest that extra support is needed, that you need to take a break, and that you would like to focus on the present. Do so with love and patience.

What does your partner say that helps you feel better when you‚Äôre feeling anxious?
