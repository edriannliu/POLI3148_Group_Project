facebook,"The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah on Oct 17 called for a “day of rage” to condemn an “Israeli strike” on a Gaza Strip hospital that left at least 500 civilians dead. The health ministry in Gaza said the blast at the hospital was caused by an Israeli air raid. However, Tel Aviv has attributed the explosion to a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) which has denied the allegations. On Oct 17, Israeli airstrikes hit a UN school in Gaza where 4,000 Palestinians had taken refuge. Could the “humanitarian crisis” unfolding in Gaza lead Hamas-ally Hezbollah to open a second front against Israel? Can Hezbollah afford to go to war with Tel Aviv?

facebook,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: ""Mr. President, Joe, I want to thank you for coming here today and for the unequivocal support you have given Israel during these trying times. A support that reflects the overwhelming will of the American people. I have seen your support every day in the depth and breath of cooperation that we have had since the beginning of this war. A level of cooperation that is truly unprecedented in the history of the great alliance between our two nations. We see that support in your steadfast commitment to provide Israel with the tools we need to defend ourselves, we see that support in the clear message you send our enemies not to test our resolve and in the two American carrier battle groups you sent into the region to back up those words with action. But above all, Mr. President, the world sees that support in the moral clarity that you have demonstrated from the moment that Israel was attacked. You have rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism. You described what Hamas did as sheer evil. It is exactly that. Hamas murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children, they burnt people alive, they raped and murdered women, they beheaded soldiers, they searched for the secret hiding places where parents hid their children. Just imagine, Mr. President, the fear and the panic of those little children in their last moments as the monsters discovered, found out their secret hiding places. Hamas kidnapped women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors. I know you share our outrage on this and I know you share our determination to bring these people back. On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. That’s twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy. Mr. President, you rightly said that Hamas is worse than ISIS. The German Chancellor, who visited here yesterday, said that Hamas were the new Nazis. You’re both right. And just as the civilized world united to defeat the Nazis and united to defeat ISIS, the civilized world must unite to defeat Hamas. I can assure you, Mr. President, Israel is united to defeat Hamas and we will defeat Hamas and remove this terrible threat from our lives. The forces of civilization will prevail, for our sake, for your sake, for peace and security in our region and in the world. Mr. President, for the people of Israel there is only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel and that is having you standing in Israel. Your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel in a time of war. It is deeply, deeply moving. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to the future of the Jewish people and the one and only Jewish state. So I know I speak for all the people of Israel when I say thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for standing with Israel today, tomorrow and always"".

facebook,"Gambaran Kekuatan Militer Hizbullah Lebanon Bikin Israel Ketar-ketir Para pengamat khawatir bahwa bergabungnya Hizbullah dalam perang melawan Israel dapat menyebabkan kehancuran Lebanon dan eskalasi regional. Hal ini setelah gerakan Hizbullah Lebanon memperingatkan bahwa mereka sepenuhnya siap berperang melawan Israel. Israel dan Hizbullah saling baku tembak sejak faksi bersenjata Palestina Hamas menyerang Israel pada 7 Oktober dan menewaskan sekira 1.400 orang. Ketika kekerasan meningkat, para pengamat khawatir Hizbullah akan membuka front baru melawan Israel atas perintah para pemimpinnya dan pendukung mereka dari Iran. Mengenai kekuatan militer Hizbullah, Nicholas Blanford, seorang pakar yang berbasis di Beirut dari Atlantic Council mengatakan kelompok Hizbullah memiliki 3.000 hingga 5.000 pesawat tempur dan rudal jarak pendek untuk menyerang Israel. Namun selama 17 tahun terakhir, Hizbullah telah meningkatkan kemampuan militernya secara signifikan. Kepada Al Jazeera Blanford mengatakan Hizbullah saat ini memiliki kemampuan untuk menimbulkan kerusakan terbesar pada Israel. Blanford memperkirakan Hizbullah memiliki setidaknya 60.000 pejuang, termasuk pejuang penuh waktu dan cadangan. Kelompok ini juga meningkatkan persediaan rudalnya dari 14.000 pada tahun 2006 menjadi sekitar 150.000 untuk sekarang. Sebagian besar merupakan rudal jarak pendek. Hizbullah juga memiliki rudal berpemandu presisi buatan Iran yang memiliki jangkauan 300 km (186 mil). Blanford menambahkan bahwa unit pasukan khusus Hizbullah dilatih untuk menyusup ke Israel jika terjadi perang. Maka tak mengherankan jika para pejabat Israel selama beberapa tahun terakhir menganggap Hizbullah sebagai ancaman utama mereka. Seperti diketahui pada tahun 2021, Hamas dan Hizbullah pernah terlibat perang melawan Israel yang berlangsung selama 11 hari. Perang tersebut dipicu serangan Israel terhadap masjid Al-Aqsa di Yerusalem Timur. Hamas menembakkan lebih dari 4.000 roket ke Israel. Sedangkan Israel melakukan serangan balik dengan menggunakan senjata lebih mematikan untuk menyerang warga sipil di Gaza. Hizbullah mengekspresikan solidaritasnya dengan Hamas dan menembakkan beberapa roket ke Israel dari Lebanon. Perang tersebut berakhir dengan gencatan senjata yang ditengahi oleh Mesir. Dengan begitu, kekuatan dua kelompok militer ini memang tergolong besar. Terlebih Hamas dan Hizbullah menjadi dua kelompok yang berpengalaman menyerang Israel. Jika mereka bergabung, maka dapat membuat Israel kewalahan di medan tempur. editor : ica",,14622,"{'like_count': 12086, 'comment_count': 994, 'num_users': 1699604}",tribunjateng.com,,2023-10-18 03:05:38,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352206188_1397716360793931_3183439650178079795_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=k-GcT33VwY8AX9w0iPt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCoyGcZ_clRTdkT5aoogzO9bsGp_dMA_5ZehktxhcHpCA&oe=655A29D7,https://www.facebook.com/100064831082935/posts/751173140387049,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393660286_1054560952243974_1222004678464959676_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=h3Nqy5JNf-EAX8Hku-c&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBUlaNFeb8ZhOEhf3fiIJjlDpXM0Sg8NjXo0QyP-8m-uA&oe=653362B5

facebook,"Joe cel înțelept și furia oarbă Nu are niciun sens ca Israelul să trimită o rachetă asupra unui spital, nici dacă acolo ar fi ascunși niște conducători Hamas. Armata israeliană nu a invadat Gaza; așteaptă, cu răbdare, ca populația civilă să ajungă într-o poziție protejată. Face tot ce poate ca lichidarea liderilor Hamas să nu provoace moartea unui număr mare de palestinieni nevinovați, știind foarte bine că acesta este scopul urmărit cu cinism de Hamas. În condițiile astea, să crezi că militarii israelieni au identificat o parcare aglomerată a unui spital și au tras asupra ei cu mijloacele lor de precizie supertehnologizate, ca să ucidă 500 de oameni la întâmplare, e bezna totală a creierului uman. Și totuși, milioane de oameni din toată lumea, nu doar palestinieni, nu doar arabi, nu doar musulmani, vor fi convinși de asta, acum și în viitor. Nu știu câte vieți vor mai fi curmate pentru a răzbuna „crima” Israelului din 17 octombrie. Dovezile zdrobitoare difuzate de Israel, care arată că e vorba de o rachetă trasă de pe teritoriul Gaza, nu din Israel, caracteristicile exploziei, mai mult un incendiu, cu crater mic, convorbirea dintre doi hamas despre apartenența la organizația Jihad Islamic a rachetei, căzută, potrivit înregistrărilor din satelit, la scurtă vreme după lansare, cu mult combustibil la bord, vor fi pur și simplu ignorate. Oamenii cu minte puțină, injectați cu furie, văd ce vor să vadă și să audă, nu ce se vede și se aude. Și se năpustesc acum asupra ambasadelor Israelului, Americii, Franței și Angliei. Urcându-se pe valul de ură, Iranul dă ordin ca toți ambasadorii Israelului din țările arabe să fie expulzați. Indivizi care zbiară Allahu Akbar! omoară oameni nevinovați pe străzile Eurropei. În această situație groaznică, prezența și discursul președintelui Statelor Unite, Joseph Biden, în Israel vor rămâne un moment astral în istorie. „Boșorogul”, „ramolitul”, „senilul”, „bideu”, cum îl insultă de ani de zile trumpiții din întreaga lume, a fost curajos, hotărât, concentrat, cât se poate de rațional și echilibrat. A asigurat Israelul, amintind spusele Goldei Meir „Noi nu avem unde să ne ducem”, de susținerea fermă din partea SUA, dar a și obținut deschiderea de coridoare umanitare în Gaza și a pronunțat soluția fundamentală, să existe, alături de Israel, un stat palestinian suveran. Spre deosebire de ce a făcut dușmanul lui de moarte de acasă, trumpul, care vorbește Americii despre el însuși aidoma lui Hitler, „Ein Volk, ein, Reich, ein Führer!” – a găsit de cuviință să-l înjure acum pe Netanyahu, deoarece l-a felicitat pe Biden pentru câștigarea alegerilor, și a complimentat Hezbollah, numind teroriștii „very smart”, adică „băieți isteți”. Iar amicii trumpului, Ping și Putin, plănuiesc împreună cum să își înalțe dictaturile sinistre, pe un munte de cadavre, asupra unei bucăți zdravene din această lume, dacă nu asupra lumii întregi. Am adunat prea multe arsuri și cicatrici pe scoarța cerebrală ca să mă mai sperii. Dar cuvintele înțeleptului Joe „Nu sunteți singuri”, felul în care le-a rostit, mărturisesc, conștient că voi fi și luat de prost, că mi-au adus o undă de speranță în suflet.",,12937,"{'like_count': 10379, 'comment_count': 874, 'num_users': 313627}",Cristian Tudor Popescu,,2023-10-18 16:53:15,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-1/201804458_342169563941739_6923760398382622285_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f97dfd&_nc_ohc=0gWHBL40eHkAX84tLCI&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCyx1ExQzZLJ-h7A4-KIcaU2yuqiceCarvawjRDL3eCaA&oe=657D5F73,https://www.facebook.com/100044460938303/posts/872261827599174,

facebook,"Sâmbătă dimineață, 7 octombrie, baza militară din Nahal Oz, la granița Israelului cu Gaza. Karina, o tânără de 19 ani, înrolată de un an în Forțele de Apărare ale Israelului pentru satisfacerea obligatorie a serviciului militar, tocmai ieșise din garda de noapte. Era cu alte două colege, când au început să se audă sirenele de raid aerian declanșat dinspre Fâșia Gaza. Au mers să se adăpostească, dar în scurt timp, tinerele și-au dat seama și că teroriștii Hamas tocmai trecuseră granița și atacaseră baza militară unde se aflau ele. Prima persoană pe care Karina a sunat-o a fost sora ei, Alexandra Ariev, mai mare decât ea cu cinci ani. După care și-a sunat părinții - un apel de rămas bun... „Era 6:30 dimineața când m-a sunat și mi-a spus că baza unde se află și toată partea de sud a Israelului este bombardată și că ea și alte fete se află într-un adăpost antiaerian. Nu aveau arme pentru a se apăra. Mi-a spus că în bază are loc un raid al teroriștilor care probabil au traversat granița din Gaza, și au ajuns în bază. Îi auzeau pe teroriști. În timp ce vorbeam cu ea, am putut să aud și eu dialectul arab, puteam auzi împușcăturile și bombardamentul. Karina i-a sunat pe părinții mei și și-a luat rămas bun, le-a spus că, dacă nu va scăpa de viață, ne roagă să ne continuăm viața... Ne-a spus că ne iubește”. Vocea Alexandrei - Sasha, cum îi spun prietenii - se oprește gâtuită de emoție, în timp ce ne povestește la telefon. La 7:40, Alexandra a primit de la Karina un ultim mesaj pe WhatsApp: o anunța că teroriștii au ajuns în adăpostul antiaerian în care se ascundea cu colegele ei din Forțele de Apărare ale Israelului. Câteva ore mai târziu, Sasha a început să caute informații pe internet despre sora ei. A identificat-o într-un videoclip Telegram. În imagini sora ei are fața plină de sânge, iar pe fundal se aud bărbați strigând: „Asta nu e nimic, abia începem"". După ce familia a arătat videoclipul autorităților israeliene, Alexandra spune că acestea le-au confirmat în cele din urmă că sora ei, Karina, a fost răpită...",,11977,"{'like_count': 3378, 'comment_count': 759, 'num_users': 156751}",Republica,,2023-10-18 03:48:00,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/311588736_475942157895661_4977287251715448868_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=tCL0vIkJ8DsAX_eEpCu&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAYLl3gEXQf-LUWu4Vw5dk5SrXT8KhnXuoZ9l0OMTH4Cg&oe=655A8EB7,https://www.facebook.com/100064396433403/posts/709448464545028,https://external-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/15024715991029162418?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.republica.ro%2F20231017%2F900x600%2Fd7a36a5709fc43099a1f798340254edc91b8e257.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=republica.ro&ccb=13-1&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=5109ac&_nc_sid=64c8fc&oh=06_AbFMdQRN2-tVEnvqJ_4YcYs44k3BNxvHymVWRoD7K-hHHQ&oe=65403463
facebook,"INTERVISTA AL “CORRIERE DELLA SERA” ❓Presidente Conte, per lei tutto quello che fa Meloni è senza coraggio. Per la premier invece la legge di Bilancio è «seria e realistica». «Non è così purtroppo. È una manovra che ignora i problemi reali, il caro-vita, il caro-benzina e l'impennata delle rate dei mutui». ❓Non è un problema di soldi, più che di coraggio? «È proprio il coraggio che manca, perché l'Italia era in corsa e questo governo ha ingranato la retromarcia. La situazione è aggravata dagli slogan con cui Meloni prende in giro gli italiani su sanità, cuneo fiscale, asili e pensioni». ❓In un quadro internazionale drammatico, con le guerre e l'inflazione, è proprio sicuro che lei avrebbe fatto meglio? «La mia prima manovra era pari a 47 miliardi, nessuno ha fatto altrettanto. Poi mi sono trovato a operare in condizioni di eccezionalità assoluta, con una pandemia che ha provocato la più grande crisi dal Dopoguerra. Ma anche in quel contesto abbiamo messo in campo misure dirompenti e coraggiose, dai ristori al blocco dei licenziamenti, alle garanzie statali alle imprese». ❓Ma c'era la pandemia... «Grazie anche al Superbonus, che Meloni usa come alibi, abbiamo risollevato l'Italia con un più 12% di Pil in due anni. Durante la nostra crisi più buia sono andato in Europa e ho riportato 209 miliardi, invece Meloni va in giro per il mondo ad accreditare se stessa nei consessi internazionali e a dire ""signorsì"" a chi vuole armi a oltranza in Ucraina». ❓Non si è accorto che la linea è cambiata? Anche Crosetto ha detto che gli aiuti a Kiev non sono illimitati. «Crosetto avrebbe dovuto da tempo convincere Meloni a imprimere una svolta per i negoziati di pace, visto che la strategia dell'escalation militare non offriva vie d'uscita. Anzi, il fallimento di questa strategia sta comportando un diffuso disimpegno militare del fronte occidentale e il prezzo più grande lo pagherà la popolazione ucraina». ❓La strage all'ospedale di Gaza rischia di innescare un'escalation? «Una strage che ci lascia senza parole. La comunità internazionale non può restare a guardare, nessuno può pensare di sospendere il diritto umanitario. Giù le mani da bambini, civili e ospedali». ❓Il sostegno del M5S a Israele è senza se e senza ma, o la vostra posizione sul conflitto è ambigua? «È chiarissima, non ci sono ambiguità. Abbiamo condannato senza se e senza ma l'attacco di Hamas. Però abbiamo anche da subito chiarito che la reazione di Israele, che pure ha diritto a difendersi, non può calpestare le norme del diritto internazionale umanitario». ❓Per mettere fine al conflitto innescato dagli orribili attacchi di Hamas, l'Italia può giocare un ruolo? «L'Italia ha le carte in regola e la sensibilità diplomatica per esprimere la sua tradizionale capacità di dialogo. Purtroppo è questo governo che non la rende all'altezza del compito, come ha già dimostrato in Tunisia e sui negoziati Ue per l'immigrazione». ❓La battaglia per il salario minimo l'ha vinta la destra, grazie allo stop di Brunetta? «No, la battaglia non finisce qui. Noi continueremo a portare in Aula e fuori la voce dei cittadini e di quei 3,6 milioni di lavoratori con stipendi da fame. Ma è avvilente che una premier non abbia il coraggio di metterci la faccia fino in fondo e debba fuggire a nascondersi dietro un altro ente, come ha fatto la Meloni con il Cnel». ❓Sbaglia la premier anche quando vi accusa di «bugie» sui fondi alla sanità? «Meloni opera come il baro del gioco delle tre carte, la verità è che la quota di investimenti va misurata in base al Pil, non in valore assoluto, quindi questo governo sottrae 18 miliardi. Con il mio arrivammo oltre il 7% in linea con la Ue, mentre Meloni ci vuole riportare al 6,4% nel 2024, ai livelli pre-pandemia. Anche l'annuncio sulle liste d'attesa è un bluff. Per il sindacato dei medici, non si abbattono le liste chiedendo gli straordinari a un personale stremato». ❓In Parlamento la manovra sarà blindata. Che ne pensa? «Stanno brutalizzando le prerogative del Parlamento. E così, dopo la crescita zero e dopo zero euro in più ai lavoratori, abbiamo anche il Parlamento zero». ❓Zero euro? Meloni dice «100 euro in busta paga». «È stata costretta a prorogare il taglio del cuneo fiscale programmato da me e poi da Draghi, ma non lo ha reso strutturale. Ha fatto credere che i lavoratori avranno 100 euro in busta paga e questo è un altro bluff. Per non parlare dello spot sugli asili nido». ❓Parliamone. Perché spot? «Hanno dato una notizia falsa e sono stati costretti a smentirla.

Dies rechtfertigt jedoch keine militärischen Angriffe, bei denen das Völkerrecht missachtet und der Schutz der Zivilbevölkerung nicht gewährleistet wird. Die Bundesregierung muss sich jetzt mit Nachdruck der Forderung des UN-Generalsekretärs nach einer humanitären Feuerpause im Nahost-Konflikt anschließen, damit Hilfsorganisationen lebenswichtige Hilfe, insbesondere für Mütter und Kinder, für verletzte, kranke und alte Menschen leisten können. Eine solche Feuerpause ist auch nötig, um durch unabhängige Institutionen zu klären, wer für den Beschuss eines Krankenhauses in Gaza verantwortlich ist. Dieser Angriff, bei dem womöglich hunderte Menschen getötet oder verletzt wurden, ist furchtbar und nicht zu rechtfertigen. Die Abriegelung des Gazastreifens muss aufgehoben und den Vereinten Nationen Zugang gewährt werden, um dringende humanitäre Hilfe für palästinensische Zivilisten zu leisten. Es gibt für den Nahost-Konflikt keine militärische Lösung!

facebook,"It’s been an extremely painful time globally and the impact of it has been significant here in our communities as well. We are devastated by the violence in Israel and Palestine. The inhumane attacks and loss of thousands of innocent civilians including women and children, elderly, or entire families are unjustifiable. Here is a part of my statement in the Legislature to the Conservative Government's motion to recognize the “ inalienable right of the State of Israel to defend itself”. I condemn the attacks by Hamas. And with that responsibility to Human rights and Justice, we must also look at the bigger conflict that has brought horror across Israel and Palestine. As scholar Peter Beinart, a professor of journalism and political science and an editor of Jewish Currents magazine wrote in The New York Times: “As Jewish Israelis bury their dead and recite psalms for their captured, few want to hear at this moment that millions of Palestinians lack basic human rights. Neither do many Jews abroad. I understand; this attack has awakened the deepest traumas of our badly scarred people. But the truth remains: The denial of Palestinian freedom sits at the heart of this conflict, which began long before Hamas’s creation in the late 1980s.” The people of Palestine have endured brutality for decades. Violence has endangered the lives of civilians in Israel and Palestine. We cannot deny the complex history that has impacted generations in this region and the deep trauma it has caused. Today, we’re seeing innocent Palestinians suffering at a scale we have never seen before as a result of the siege of Gaza. Two million Palestinians in Gaza, half of whom are children deserve to have the same basic human rights to survive as everyone else in this world. With the Ontario New Democrats and Leader Marit Stiles, I introduced an amendment “to call on the Government of Canada to advocate for the immediate release of all hostages, the protection of all civilians in accordance with international law, an end to the siege and bombardment of Gaza, and for humanitarian aid to reach Palestinian civilians urgently and without restriction.” We along with the international community are urgently calling for a ceasefire, a humanitarian aid corridor to save innocent lives, and work towards a sustainable solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace, security, and mutual self-determination. The Government of Canada can play an important role in bringing peace. We are asking Prime Minister Trudeau to do everything in his power to stand with the UN calling for peace and justice and ensure the protection of civilians and respect for international law. At a time when the Province needs unity and compassion for human life, the Ford Government is playing politics to divide us and create even more chaos and unrest in our local communities. If this government continues to block our amendment, we urge them to withdraw this motion and replace it with one that unifies Ontarians. One that expresses our firm condemnation of the terrorist attacks by Hamas, call for an end to the siege and bombardment of Gaza, support for Israeli and Palestinian civilians in accordance with international law, and calling for de-escalation and peace in the region.",,7024,"{'like_count': 4255, 'comment_count': 412, 'num_users': 43562}",Doly Begum,,2023-10-18 19:24:26,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/399624164_905570334261922_7359052375881425105_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=_YdFV-pYm7oAX_fGT7u&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfCUWlP78WvuMFcruVnEd1Vm88QvNXD53tpw63zUrgA9nQ&oe=655AFA4C,https://www.facebook.com/100044268917766/posts/891779542307668,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393956233_2278790682325710_2387130937650516948_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=KJqRWo913GEAX_Tz7AQ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBymHcHDLc9mkeHm7Aa_Y5bMOYCVziIa5cQjvHnBb-NjQ&oe=655ABC88

facebook,"Ospedale di Gaza Al-Ahli, morti dappertutto Caro Ambasciatore d’Israele a Roma, Alon Bar, siccome i media italiani che si occupano di politica internazionale sono corrotti fino al midollo, le spiego il problema facilmente. La Giordania ha annullato la visita di Biden per esprimergli disprezzo giacché i giordani reputano che Biden sia corresponsabile del massacro del popolo palestinese. I giordani pensano che Israele non potrebbe occupare le terre palestinesi da 56 anni e calpestare i diritti umani attraverso il terrorismo di Stato senza il sostegno degli Stati Uniti. Chiunque abbia visitato i Paesi del Medio Oriente sa che tutti i mediorientali, tolte un paio di persone, odiano Biden. E' per questo motivo che moltissimi mediorientali festeggiarono l'attentato contro le Torri gemelle. Ed è per questo stesso motivo che, se domani - speriamo mai - gli Stati Uniti dovessero subire un altro orrore analogo per mano di al Qaeda, i mediorientali, tolte un paio di persone, esulterebbero. Gli studi scientifici sul terrorismo hanno dimostrato che il terrorismo ha cause sociali. In questo mio articolo, espongo e spiego tutte le più importanti teorie scientifiche sulla radicalizzazione verso il terrorismo elaborate finora nelle più importanti università del mondo.

Yael Keidar from Kibbutz Be’eri is living with a cognitive and developmental disabilities. She survived the Be’eri massacre on that dreadful Saturday morning of Oct 7th, while her father was murdered, and her mother was kidnapped by the terror organization Hamas. She hid for may hours in her safe room, from Hamas terrorists that broke into her house. The terrorists set her house on fire and left after a few hours that felt like forever. When it was finally quiet, Keidar realized they left, she stepped out of the safe room and called for help. a few hours later, when IDF cleared the Kibbutz, she was found and evacuated to Soroka Hospital for further treatment. “It was very hard” she recounts, “when the sirens started blaring, I went into the safe-room and remained there till they stopped. At one point I wanted to step out to get some food from the fridge”. Nothing prepared her for what she saw on her way to the kitchen. “The entire house was burned down” she tells SHAVVIM in pain. When she was in the living room, looking at the mayhem left by the terrorists, the sirens started sounding again. She ran back to the safe room, tripped and fell, and unfortunately lost consciousness for several hours. Around 1pm she regained consciousness and called her relatives for help, but no one could come. “They all tried to calm me down and told me not to worry”. All this while she hears the terrorists roaming around the area, talking amongst themselves. “I understood I couldn’t get out of the safe room”. An hour later, when the voices subsided, Keidar realized it was now or never, and she has to try and get out and call for help. “I got out and went to the living room, I screamed for help, but no one came for a very long time”. Only around 5pm, during one of the IDF sweeps searching for survivors, the soldiers came in and found her. “They heard me shouting, they came in to save me”. The soldiers evacuated her to get much needed medical assistance at Soroka Hospital, Be’er Sheva.

facebook,"Tersebar Detik-detik Diduga Upaya Pasukan Hamas Beri Perlawanan ke Tentara Israel di Perbatasan! VP: Erric SURYA.CO.ID - Kelompok Hamas menunjukkan rekaman memperlihatkan kerasnya perlawanan terhadap Tentara Israel di perbatasan. Rekamannya beredar di Telegram pada Senin, 16 Oktober 2023. Sejumlah pria bersenjata lengkap tampak merangsek masuk ke wilayah Israel. Mereka juga meluncurkan serangan menggunakan pelontar granat. Tembakan hingga ledakan terdengar jelas dalam rekaman. Serangan ini disebut dilakukan sebagai tanggapan atas kejahatan otoritas Israel terhadap warga sipil Palestina. Bahkan terbaru, sayap militer Hamas, Brigade Izzudin Al-Qassam mengumumkan bahwa mereka akan melancarkan serangan baru ke Bandara Ben-Gurion di Tel Aviv. Hal itu disampaikan oleh Al-Qassam seusai pasukan mereka menyerang dua kota milik Israel yakni Ashdod dan Be'er Sheva.

facebook,"The air strike on Al Ahli Arab Hospital killed about 500 Palestinians, according to health authorities in Palestine. It is the bloodiest single incident in Gaza since Israel launched an unrelenting bombing campaign against the densely populated territory. Israel's military denied responsibility for the attack, saying military intelligence suggested the hospital was hit by a failed rocket launch by the enclave's Palestinian Islamic Jihad military group. Meanwhile, Palestinian Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a televised speech late on Tuesday that the United States is responsible for the attack, stressing that Washington gave Israel ""the cover for its aggression."" The World Health Organization, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, among others on Tuesday condemned the attack.

facebook,"President Joe Biden cautioned the Israeli government to avoid being 'consumed' by 'rage' in his remarks from Tel Aviv on October 18. Biden traveled to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid the growing Israel-Gaza conflict. During his remarks, Biden referenced 9/11 and admitted that the United States was enraged after the terrorist attack and 'made mistakes' while seeking justice. 'But I caution this while you feel that rage: Don't be consumed by it,' Biden said. 'After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes ... I know the choices are never clear or easy for leadership. There's always cost. But it requires being deliberate. It requires asking very hard questions. It requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives.' Biden didn't specify what mistakes, but many have assumed he was alluding to the U.S.'s invasion of Iraq after 9/11, which he supported as a senator at the time, but has since said was a mistake. The Iraq War destabilized the region for years and led to an enormous loss of civilian life, estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. Critics argued that Biden's warning came off as somewhat hollow, given his administration’s substantial military aid to Israel. His remarks glossed over the stark power disparity between Israel and Palestine and failed to sufficiently address the humanitarian crisis unfolding in real time, they said. In his address, Biden went on to urge the Israeli war cabinet to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza, predicated on inspections to ensure the aid bypasses Hamas. He stressed, 'The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people.' Following this appeal, Israel agreed to allow the entry of aid into Gaza. However, detractors pointed out that these stringent conditions on aid, coupled with the U.S.'s unwavering military support for Israel, might inadvertently perpetuate the cycle of violence and hamper efforts to achieve a sustainable cease-fire and lasting peace.",,5089,"{'like_count': 2517, 'comment_count': 1637, 'num_users': 10428136}",NowThis Politics,,2023-10-18 19:00:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/352572773_601212558477580_1162756159947910709_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=i0hZdK9etT4AX9jxWWf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDlwacfZFeyzgJ56hSuuZ7Wwv9mCfqOaeVWhRrhaKQFtQ&oe=655A43CD,https://www.facebook.com/100064655201117/posts/713788984119602,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/391614667_713788920786275_5836719026217934611_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=-9Ef0EEFk2sAX8enVLq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfA7165Ri70KVK3RMCtSnkPZYWIU2Z_mreamtB4v29jvtQ&oe=654143E3

facebook,"Israel sempat disepelekan tak mampu melancarkan serangan darat ke Gaza lantaran cuaca yang buruk. Namun kini Israel membuktikan bahwa militernya justru mampu membombardir Gaza pada Selasa (17/10/2023). Akibatnya, salah satu komandan tertinggi Hamas dilaporkan tewas. Dikutip dari The Times of Israel, Komandan Hamas yang terbunuh adalah Ayman Nofal. Hal itu diungkapkan oleh Pasukan Pertahanan Israel (IDF) melalui akun Twitternya pada Selasa malam. ""Kami baru saja melenyapkan Ayman Nofal, seorang agen senior Hamas. Nofal adalah Komandan Brigade Pusat Hamas di Gaza dan mantan Kepala Intelijen Militer."" tulis IDF. Disebutkan, selain menjadi komandan Hamas, Ayman Nofal juga merupakan anggota Dewan Militer Umum organisasi tersebut. IDF menyebut Nofal merupakan salah satu orang yang sangat berperan dalam perang Hamas dan Israel. Pasalnya, salah satu komandan Hamas ini banyak melakukan serangan ke Israel dan pasukan keamanannya. Ayman Nofal tewas saat Israel menyerang kamp pengungsi Bureij pada Selasa (17/10/2023). Ia terkena serangan dari Israel saat sedang berada di rumahnya. Adapun kabar kematian Ayman Nofal juga diunggah oleh juru bicara militer Israel, Laksamana Muda Daniel Hagari. Tak hanya itu, Daniel Hagari juga mengunggah video yang memperlihatkan serangan Israel ke posisi markas Ayman Nofal. Dari video yang diunggahnya terlihat ledakkan dahsyat yang memporak-porandakan wilayah tersebut.

facebook,"The truth matters. The hospital wasn't even hit; it was a parking lot next to it. Moral of the story: don't jump to conclusions amidst the fog of war. The US government assesses that Israel “was not responsible” for the blast at a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday, according to the National Security Council, following President Joe Biden’s comments that a Palestinian militant group was behind the strike. A spokesperson for the NSC, Adrienne Watson, said the assessment was based on available reporting, including “intelligence, missile activity, and open source video and images of the incident.” “While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” Watson said in a statement on Wednesday. The NSC followed up with an additional statement Wednesday afternoon leaning further into its assessment. “Intelligence indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed that the explosion was likely caused by an errant rocket or missile launch carried out by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The militants were still investigating what had happened,” Watson said. Israeli officials have released audio of what they say is Hamas militants discussing the blast and attributing it to a rocket launched by PIJ. Officials told CNN separately that the initial evidence gathered by the US intelligence community suggests that the hospital strike came from a rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group. Among the evidence that’s been gathered is a blast analysis that suggests it was a ground explosion rather than an airstrike that hit the hospital, one of the sources said. There was no singular crater suggesting there was a bomb, but there was extensive fire damage and scattered debris that is consistent with an explosion starting from the ground level, according to the source. That analysis is one datapoint that’s led intelligence officials to lean toward assessing that the attack on the hospital was a rocket launch gone wrong.

facebook,"Israel og Palæstina. Det var en meget rørende aften i Borups Højskole, hvor jøder, palæstinenser, danskere og andre medborgere var samlet for at starte den svære samtale om, hvad krigen gør ved os i Danmark. Formålet var hverken at analysere situationen, eller kommer med storpolitiske løsninger. Det var heller ikke at trække fronterne yderligere hårdt op. Vi var samlet for at tale om, hvordan vi taler sammen om noget så kompliceret, svært og smertefuldt. Hvordan anerkender vi følelserne fra begge sider og givet plads til sorgen over de civiletab, som desværre fortsætter! Senest med flere hundrede drabte på et hospital i Gaza. En jødisk mor rejste sig op og fortalte, hvor mange i hendes familie og vennekreds var direkte berørt i Israel og når hun talte med folk i Danmark, endte samtalen tit om politik. Men hun havde mest brug for at tale om det personlige, for det var dét, der gjorde ondt. En smerte som en palæstinensisk kvinde delte. Hun kom over til Jair og mig i pausen og græd over situationen og fortalte at kun kun efterlyste forståelse for, hvor ondt det også gjorde i hende og hos andre palæstinenser. 200 mennesker sad sammen i en kæmpe sal, og var forbundet på kryds og tværs. Budskabet fra min formand Jair Melchior og mig var: at vi hver især har et ansvar for at ikke grave grøfterne dybere men insistere på at tage den svære samtale om Israel og Palæstina med hinanden. Uden at dehumanisere og dæmonisere. Der er brug for mere og ikke mindre dialog i denne svære situation. At anerkende den jødiske smerte over tab af civile betyder ikke, at man går ind for undertrykkelse eller drab af civile palæstinenser. Ligesom det heller ikke betyder, at man støtter Hamas, når man begræder de civile tab på palæstinensisk side. Vi skal passe på med at gøre verden sort/hvid, men insistere på nuancerne. Paula Larrain var ordstyrer. Hun er selv flygtning og journalist. I øjeblikket er billederne voldsomme på sociale medier og vi føler alle sammen en afmagt. Men vi kan gøre en forskel, ved at række ud til dem, som vi er uenig med. Dem som er berørt af situatinen. Lytte, anerkende og være uenige uden at være ukærlige. Vi i Brobyggerne - Center for Dialogkaffe regner med, at vi skal lave flere af disse arrangementer. Håber er, at vi også skal lave lukkede møder mellem palæstinensiske og jødiske medborgere I Danmark, for at starte den svære samtale. Nej, vi har ikke magten til stoppe krigen i Mellemøsten, men måske kan vi bidrage til at freden mellem befolkningsgrupper i Danmark fortsætter.

facebook,"ฮามาส-อิสราเอลโทษกันไปมา หลังระเบิดลง รพ.กาซาดับอย่างน้อย 500 ศพ กระทรวงสาธารณสุขที่บริหารโดยกลุ่มฮามาสระบุว่า เมื่อวันอังคารที่ผ่านมา (17 ต.ค.) เกิดเหตุระเบิดขนาดใหญ่ ใส่โรงพยาบาลในฉนวนกาซาที่เต็มไปด้วยผู้บาดเจ็บ และชาวปาเลสไตน์คนอื่นๆ ซึ่งกำลังหาที่พักพิงจากสงคราม ส่งผลให้มีผู้เสียชีวิตหลายร้อยราย ทั้งนี้ กลุ่มฮามาสอ้างโทษการโจมตีทางอากาศต่อโรงพยาบาลแห่งนี้ ว่าเป็นฝีมือของอิสราเอล ในขณะที่กองทัพอิสราเอลอ้างว่า โรงพยาบาลถูกโจมตีด้วยจรวดที่ยิงโดยกลุ่มฮามาสเอง ทั้งนี้ กระทรวงสาธารณสุขของฉนวนกาซาเปิดเผยว่า มีผู้เสียชีวิตจากเหตุระเบิดลงโรงพยาบาลในครั้งนี้อย่างน้อย 500 คน เหตุการณ์นี้ส่งผลให้เกิดความโกรธกระจายไปทั่วภูมิภาค เนื่องจากการสังหารผู้บริสุทธิ์ในโรงพยาบาล ในขณะที่ โจ ไบเดน ประธานาธิบดีสหรัฐฯ กำลังมุ่งหน้าไปยังภูมิภาคตะวันออกกลาง ด้วยความหวังที่จะเจรจาเพื่อหยุดยั้งสงครามไม่ให้ลุกลาม แต่เหตุระเบิดโรงพยาบาลในครั้งนี้ ส่งผลให้ชาติตะวันออกกลางยกเลิกการหารือกับสหรัฐฯ เพื่อประท้วงต่อความรุนแรงในครั้งนี้ อย่างไรก็ดี รัฐมนตรีว่าการกระทรวงการต่างประเทศจอร์แดนกล่าวว่า จอร์แดนได้ยกเลิกการประชุมสุดยอดระดับภูมิภาค ที่มีกำหนดขึ้นในวันพุธ (18 ต.ค.) ณ กรุงอัมมาน ที่เป็นหนึ่งในกำหนดการเยือนของไบเดน เพื่อเข้าเฝ้าสมเด็จพระราชาธิบดีอับดุลเลาะห์ที่ 2 แห่งจอร์แดน และพบปะกับ มาห์มุด อับบาส ประธานาธิบดีปาเลสไตน์ และ อับเดล ฟัตตาห์ เอล-ซิสซี ประธานาธิบดีอียิปต์ อัยมาน ซาฟาดี รัฐมนตรีว่าการกระทรวงการต่างประเทศจอร์แดน ระบุกับสถานีโทรทัศน์ของรัฐบาลว่า สงครามระหว่างอิสราเอลและฮามาส กำลัง “ผลักดันภูมิภาคนี้ไปสู่ขอบเหว” โดยเขากล่าวว่าจอร์แดนจะเป็นเจ้าภาพการประชุมสุดยอด ต่อเมื่อทุกคนเห็นพ้องกันว่า จุดประสงค์ของการประชุมคือ “หยุดสงคราม เคารพมนุษยชาติของชาวปาเลสไตน์ และมอบความช่วยเหลือที่พวกเขาสมควรได้รับ” ทั้งนี้ ทำเนียบข่าวแถลงว่า ไบเดนจะเดินทางเยือนอิสราเอลตามกำหนดการเท่านั้น การระเบิดส่งผลให้เกิดฉากที่น่าสยดสยอง โดยวิดีโอที่สำนักข่าว AP ให้การยืนยันว่าได้ภาพมาจากโรงพยาบาล แสดงให้เห็นไฟลุกท่วมอาคารและบริเวณโรงพยาบาล ซึ่งเต็มไปด้วยซากศพที่ฉีกขาด โดยหลายศพในนั้นเป็นเด็กเล็ก ซึ่งรายล้อมไปด้วยผ้าห่ม เป้สะพายหลังของโรงเรียน และข้าวของอื่นๆ กลุ่มฮามาสเรียกเหตุระเบิดในโรงพยาบาลเมื่อวันอังคารว่าเป็น “การสังหารหมู่ที่น่าสยดสยอง” โดยทางกลุ่มกล่าวว่าเหตุระเบิดดังกล่าวมีสาเหตุมาจากการโจมตีของอิสราเอล ในทางตรงกันข้าม กองทัพอิสราเอลกล่าวโทษกลุ่มญิฮาดอิสลาม ซึ่งเป็นกลุ่มติดอาวุธปาเลสไตน์ที่มีขนาดเล็กกว่าและหัวรุนแรงกว่า และมักจะให้ความร่วมมือกับกลุ่มฮามาสในการต่อสู้กับอิสราเอลร่วมกัน ว่าอยู่เบื้องหลังการโจมตีในครั้งนี้ โดยกองทัพอิสราเอลกล่าวว่า กลุ่มติดอาวุธญิฮาดอิสลามได้ยิงจรวดจำนวนมากใกล้โรงพยาบาลในขณะนั้น และ “ข่าวกรองจากหลายแหล่ง” บ่งชี้ว่าพวกเขา “มีส่วนรับผิดชอบต่อการยิงจรวดที่ล้มเหลวซึ่งตกใส่โรงพยาบาล” ในการบรรยายสรุปกับผู้สื่อข่าว พล.ท.ดาเนียล ฮาการี โฆษกกองทัพบกอิสราเอล กล่าวว่า กองทัพอิสราเอลไม่มีการโจมตีทางอากาศ ทางภาคพื้นดิน หรือทางเรือในพื้นที่ดังกล่าว ณ เวลาที่เกิดเหตุระเบิด ก่อนเวลา 19.00 น. ฮาการียังกล่าวอีกว่าเรดาร์ยังสามารถตรวจจับการยิงจรวดออกไปในเวลาเดียวกัน และมีการสกัดกั้นการสื่อสาร ระหว่างกลุ่มติดอาวุธที่บ่งชี้ว่าญิฮาดอิสลามยิงจรวดดังกล่าว ฮาการียังยังเปิดเผยภาพทางอากาศที่รวบรวมโดยโดรนของทหาร ซึ่งเขากล่าวว่าแสดงให้เห็นการระเบิดที่ไม่สอดคล้องกับอาวุธของอิสราเอล โดยการระเบิดดังกล่าวเกิดขึ้นในลานจอดรถด้านนอกอาคาร ทั้งนี้ ฮาการีระบุว่ากองทัพอิสราเอลวางแผนที่จะเปิดเผยหลักฐานต่อสาธารณะเร็วๆ นี้ รวมถึงภาพจากกล้องวงจรปิด และบันทึกการสื่อสารที่ถูกดักฟัง ชาวปาเลสไตน์หลายร้อยคนได้ลี้ภัยอยู่ในโรงพยาบาลอัล-อะห์ลี และโรงพยาบาลอื่นๆ ในฉนวนกาซาเมื่อช่วงไม่กี่วันที่ผ่านมา โดยพวกเขาหวังว่าตัวเองจะรอดพ้นจากการทิ้งระเบิด หลังจากที่อิสราเอลสั่งให้ผู้อยู่อาศัยทั้งหมดในเมืองและพื้นที่โดยรอบ อพยพไปยังพื้นที่ทางตอนใต้ของฉนวนกาซา ก่อนที่โรงพยาบาลอัล-อะห์ลีจะเกิดเหตุระเบิดจนส่งผลให้มีเสียชีวิต การโจมตีของอิสราเอลในฉนวนกาซาส่งผลให้มีผู้เสียชีวิตอย่างน้อย 2,778 ราย และได้รับบาดเจ็บอีกอย่างน้อย 9,700 ราย ตามการระบุของกระทรวงสาธารณสุขในฉนวนกาซา โดยเจ้าหน้าที่กระทรวงกล่าวว่า เกือบ 2 ใน 3 ของผู้เสียชีวิตเป็นเด็ก และทางการเชื่อว่ามีประชาชนอีก 1,200 คนทั่วฉนวนกาซา ซึ่งถูกฝังอยู่ใต้ซากปรักหักพัง ไม่ว่าจะมีชีวิตอยู่หรือเสียชีวิตไปแล้วก็ตาม การโจมตีเมื่อวันที่ 7 ต.ค. ของกลุ่มฮามาส บริเวณพื้นที่ทางตอนใต้ของอิสราเอล ได้คร่าชีวิตผู้คนไปมากกว่า 1,400 ราย ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่เป็นพลเรือน และมีการจับเชลยอีกประมาณ 200 คนเข้าไปในฉนวนกาซา ทั้งนี้ กลุ่มติดอาวุธฮามาสในฉนวนกาซาได้ยิงจรวดทุกวันตั้งแต่นั้นมา โดยมุ่งเป้าไปการโจมตีไปที่เมืองต่างๆ ทั่วอิสราเอล อ่านบนเว็บไซต์:

facebook,"The Hebrew word HAMAS is in the Bible at least 60 times. Hamas in Hebrew means “violence and wrongdoing.” We first see the Hebrew word Hamas used in Genesis chapter 6. Genesis 6:11-13 (NIV) 11 Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence [HAMAS]. 12 God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. 13 So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.” We also see Hamas used by the prophet Joel. Joel 3:19-21 (NIV) 19 But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence [HAMAS] done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood. 20 Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations. 21 Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not.” The Lord dwells in Zion! White, Red, Black and Pale Green What does Hamas want? What does their charter say? Why does Jesus warn about the Spiritual Mark on the Hamas flag? Jesus reveals they worship a spirit that is not the true God. They seek to destroy the Israel remnant that is accepting Jesus Christ in the last days. Romans 9:27 (NIV) 27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.” Isaiah 10:22-23 (NIV) 22 Though your people be like the sand by the sea, Israel, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overwhelming and righteous. 23 The Lord, the Lord Almighty, will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth. Revelation 6:7-8 (NASB) 7 When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come!” 8 I looked, and behold, a pale green horse; and the one who sat on it had the name Death, and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, and famine, and plague, and by the wild animals of the earth. Jesus is returning soon! Your redemption is drawing near. Luke 21:25-28 (NIV) 25 “There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. 26 People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. 27 At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”",,3021,"{'like_count': 1346, 'comment_count': 166, 'num_users': 155201}",Revelation Now,,2023-10-18 11:14:59,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/327433877_1615799635517935_737680100713389855_n.jpg?stp=c15.0.50.50a_cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=wOwWMC1fHVIAX8WhK6z&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBN2oEmiPm4r7y94wo4kfV_XCY9prpP_Lsvv3DPhv9pQw&oe=655A186D,https://www.facebook.com/100066866855804/posts/653973203508236,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/393879159_642193474463062_4477048787852891113_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1a7029&_nc_ohc=G6xO88jnw4MAX8lpcrM&_nc_oc=AQk9zRF9o2RIJlYX-z1dAHlAm4S1LvRFb9VlZ9SIWq4wU67dSONzAXbCtOgox1Azbuw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDpqc_bjGpyU1sfj3sO24CQNV41VqYXFOOLr7pTsjvu6w&oe=6533F643

facebook,"🔴 نشر الناطق باسم الجيش الإسرائيلي، دانيال هاجاري، تسجيلا صوتيًا عبر حسابه على موقع ""X"" تويتر سابقًا، وزعم أنها محادثة ""دارت بين عناصر حماس بخصوص فشل عملية إطلاق صاروخية قامت بها حركة الجهاد الإسلامي على المستشفى الأهلي المعمداني بتاريخ 17 أكتوبر 2023""، واعتبر الجيش الإسرائيلي ذلك دليلًا على أن الطيران الإسرائيلي لم يقصف المستشفى، ولكن أحد صواريخ حركة الجهاد. ◾ وكانت السلطات الصحية في قطاع غزة قد أعلنت أن الطيران الإسرائيلي استهدف المستشفى الأهلي المعمداني، في وسط القطاع، ما أسفر عن سقوط أكثر من 500 شخص ما بين قتيل وجريح، ولم تعلن حتى الآن الأعداد النهائية. ◾ ولكن الجيش الإسرائيلي رد على ذلك، بأن طائراتهم لم تستهدف المستشفى، وزعم أن إحدى قذائف حركة الجهاد الإسلامي الموجهة نحو البلدات الإسرائيلية القريبة من غزة، سقطت بالخطأ على المستشفى، ونفى مسؤوليته تمامًا عن الحادث، وبدأ في بث الكثير من الفيديوهات التي تثبت صحة روايته. ⚠️ دقق صحيح مصر، ترجمة المكالمة باللغة الإنجليزية، ليجد أنها حملت تحريفًا لحديث عناصر حماس المزعومة، كما أن تلك المكالمة، والتي يدعي أحد عناصر حماس المزعومين أن صاروخ الجهاد أنطلق من المقابر الموجود خلف المستشفى، يتنافى مع خريطة نشرها المتحدث باسم الجيش الإسرائيلي، باللغة العربية، أفيخاي أدرعي، يحدد فيها موقع آخر يزعم أنه موقع إطلاق الصاروخ من حركة الجهاد نحو المستشفى. 🔴 ترجمة مُحرفة ◾ بالتدقيق في المكالمة والترجمة الإنجليزية المصاحبة لها التي نشرها هاجاري، نجد تغييرًا في محتوى المكالمة ليعطي دلالة أخرى، إذ يقول أحد أطراف المكالمة في الدقيقة 1:02، معقبًا على الشائعات أن القصف كان نتيجة وقوع شظايا صاروخ للجهاد الإسلامي، وهي الرواية التي تبنتها إسرائيل بعد وقوع الحادث: ""فبيقلك تبع صواريخ الجهاد الإسلامي"". ◾ في حين كانت الترجمة: ""we are saying it belongs to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad"" والتي تعني ""نحن نقول أنها تابعة لحركة الجهاد الإسلامي الفلسطينية"" وهو تحريف للسياق من كون المتحدث ينقل معلومات سمعها إلي كونه يصرح ويؤكد أن هذا هو ما حدث. ◾ بجانب ذلك، وبالرغم من لهجة المتحدثين الفلسطينية الواضحة في المكالمة، إلا أن التسجيل لا يحمل أي دليل على أن هؤلاء الأشخاص من عناصر حماس والجهاد الإسلامي كما زعم هاجاري. 🔴 تضارب موقع الهجوم ◾ فيما نشر أفيخاي أدرعي، المتحدث باسم الجيش الإسرائيلي باللغة العربية عبر حسابه على تويتر صورة لموقع إطلاق صواريخ الجهاد الإسلامي التي رصدتها رادارات الجيش الإسرائيلي والتي تتناقض مع ما جاء في المكالمة المزعومة. ◾ إذ ذكر المتحدثان في المكالمة أن ""موقع الإطلاق كان بالقرب من المستشفى المعمداني عند المقابر المجاورة لها""، في حين تُظهر الصورة التي نشرها أدرعي بمحاذاة شاطئ البحر المتوسط في حين موقع الإطلاق المزعوم في الفيديو بالقرب من شارع صلاح الدين الذي يتوسط قطاع غزة. ◾ وتظهر صور الأقمار الصناعية موقع المقابر -موقع الإطلاق المزعوم في التسجيل الصوتي- خلف المستشفى بالقرب من شارع صلاح الدين الشهير، وتحديدًا بين شارع المؤسسة وشارع الشيخ منصور، وبمواجهة مسجد كاتب الولاية، في حين يظهر موقع إطلاق الصواريخ في الخريطة التي نشرها أدرعي بمحاذاة الشاطئ مع حدود غزة المائية في الجنوب بالقرب من البحر المتوسط، والتي تبعد كثيرًا عن موقع المقابر، وهو ما يشكك في صحة الموقعين. 🔴 تضارب هوية المتحدثين ◾ تناقل المتحدثون باسم الجيش الإسرائيلي هذا التسجيل، ولكن مع تضارب في هوية المتحدثين المزعومة، إذ قال أدرعي، المتحدث باسم الجيش الإسرائيلي باللغة العربية، إن المكالمة بين ناشط سابق في حماس وبين أحد سكان القطاع. ◾ في حين قال هاجاري، المتحدث باسم الجيش الإسرائيلي باللغة الإنجليزية، إن المحادثة دارت بين عناصر حماس. ◾ وغرد روعي كايس، مراسل هيئة الإذاعة والتليفزيون الإسرائيلية (كان 11)، محددا أن أطراف المكالمة: ""عنصر من حماس وعنصر من الجهاد الإسلامي"". 🔴 فيديوهات مُضللة ◾ كما نشرت حسابات رسمية تابعة للخارجية الإسرائيلية وصحفيون إسرائيليون عدة فيديوهات، وزعموا أنها لحظة إطلاق حركة الجهاد قذائف صاروخية سقطت بالخطأ على المستشفى الأهلي المعمداني، ولكن البحث العكسي أظهر أن هذه الفيديوهات قديمة وليست لها علاقة من قريب أو بعيد باستهداف المستشفى. #صحيح_مصر 📨 لو عندك تصريح، خبر، بوست أو تغريدة عايز تتأكد من دقته ومدى صحته.. فريق صحيح مصر على استعداد لتلقي رسائلكم واستفساراتكم عن أي معلومة مشكوك في صحتها، عبر رسائل الصفحة أو على الايميل info@saheeh.news",,2951,"{'like_count': 2111, 'comment_count': 156, 'num_users': 1015868}",Saheeh Masr صحيح مصر,,2023-10-18 17:42:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/339108109_599340905586469_5647412430127041982_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_p50x50&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=VeqTeZpHXq8AX8S8cRt&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfAuBqmXc8jbVG04czBCXa5sDUoR_64byi-cy47w0VSitw&oe=655A2AEB,https://www.facebook.com/100044414830143/posts/869145717909248,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393501663_869143604576126_3786054905253165392_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=v32kvnYgkh0AX-4JLVm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBgnDC7x-ClRRzxisyY10Ecse0ru9MVgMrUsVDnTqszmA&oe=6534D707

Prime Minister Netanyahu: ""Mr. President, you are meeting with our united war cabinet, united in resolve to lead Israel to victory. This will be a different kind of war because Hamas is a different kind of enemy. While Israel seeks to minimize civilian casualties, Hamas seeks to maximize civilian casualties. Hamas wants to kill as many Israelis as possible and has no regard whatsoever to Palestinian lives. Every day, they perpetrate a double war crime: targeting our civilians while hiding behind their civilians, embedding themselves in the civilian population and using them as human shields. We’ve seen the cost of this terrible double war crime against humanity that Hamas is perpetrating in the last 11 days. As Israel legitimately targets terrorists, civilians are unfortunately harmed. Hamas is responsible and should be held accountable for all civilian casualties. We saw the cost of this terrible war crime yesterday when a rocket fired by Palestinian terrorists misfired and landed on a Palestinian hospital. The entire world was rightfully outraged but this outrage should be directed not at Israel but at the terrorists. As we proceed in this war, Israel will do everything it can to keep civilians out of harm’s way. We’ve asked them and we will continue to ask them to move to safer areas. We will continue to work with you, Mr. President, to assure that the minimum requirements are met and we will continue to work together to get our hostages out. Mr. President, the road to victory will be long and hard, but united in purpose and with a deep sense of justice and the unbreakable spirit of our soldiers and our people, Israel will prevail. Thank you, Mr. President."" US President Biden: ""Well, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. In the wake of Hamas’ appalling terrorist assault, it was brutal, inhumane, almost beyond belief what they did, this cabinet came together standing strong, standing united. And I want you to know you are not alone. As I emphasized earlier, we will continue to have Israel’s back as you work to defend your people. We will continue to work with you and partners across the region to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians. Seventy-five years ago, your founders declared that this nation would be one based on freedom, justice and peace. Based on freedom, justice and peace.

facebook,"Geschreven door een anonieme Amsterdammer: Als geboren en getogen Amsterdammer moet mij iets van het hart. Op 15 oktober zag ik een mensenmassa met Palestijnse vlaggen vanaf de Dam door de stad marcheren. De herrie was enorm. Wat ik zag was een massa woedende mensen, die als een soort indoctrinatie-mantra dingen riepen als “Free Palastine” en “From the river to the sea, Palastina will be free”. De haat die ik bij deze mensen in de ogen zag is ongekend. Alles aan deze mensenmassa voelde dreigend en gespannen aan. Er hing een bijna tastbare nare, agressieve sfeer. Erg intimiderend. Op 12 oktober liep ik ook langs de Dam. Ik loop namelijk bijna iedere dag twee of meer keer langs de Dam. Toen zag ik een mensenmassa met Israelische vlaggen. Er waren toespraken. Er werd gezongen en mensen legden bloemen neer. Een wereld van verschil! En na deze twee totaal verschillende bijeenkomsten werden mij dingen duidelijk die ik altijd al zag, maar waarvan het besef nu pas tot me doordringt. De woedende massa van 15 oktober kwam mij maar al te bekend voor: het zijn dezelfde mensen die ik zie fluiten en ongepaste opmerkingen maken naar meisjes. Het zijn dezelfde mensen die naar aanleiding van een voetbalwedstrijd het Hoofddorpplein onveilig maakten, auto’s in de brand staken en vernielingen pleegden. Het zijn dezelfde mensen die het nieuws halen omdat ze vanuit auto’s of vanaf scooters homo’s bespugen. Het zijn dezelfde mensen die de kermis in Osdorp veranderden in een slagveld. Het zijn dezelfde mensen die je op TV in dezelfde grote groepen, en op dezelfde manier als op de Dam, indoctrinatie mantra’s van haat jegens het westen, Amerika en – hoe kan het ook anders – Israël scanderen. En ik weet het: je moet nooit alle mensen over één kam scheren, maar deze mensen zijn afgelopen zondag zelf allemaal onder één kam gaan staan. Daar kan ik vrij weinig aan doen. In de interviews of gesprekken die ik opving noemde deze groep hun vijand de “zionisten”, maar bij wijze van verspreking hoorde ik ook vaak “Joden” voorbij komen. Wat mij opvalt is dat er verrekte weinig Joden op zelfmoordmissie gaan. Je hoort nooit eens op het nieuws dat Joden bij een aanslag zichzelf ook opbliezen. En sterker nog: ik ken eigenlijk helemaal geen voorbeelden van Joden die aanslagen plegen. Ik hoor ze ook nooit oproepen tot geweld tegen het ene, of het andere volk, en ook niet tot de uitroeiing van een ander volk. En ook Google kon mij niet verder helpen toen ik opzocht hoe vaak Joden nu eigenlijk wraak hebben gepleegd naar aanleiding van de progroms, vervolgingen in Europa of in de Arabische wereld en de genocide door de nazi’s. De enige resultaten die Google geeft over wraak van de Joden is wat de media hen toedicht in de strijd tegen bijvoorbeeld zoals nu, Hamas. En verrassend genoeg worden daarbij vaak uitsluitend de tegenstanders van Israël aan het woord gelaten die hen beschuldigen van onder meer genocide. Om te onderzoeken wat er van die beschuldiging waar is (wat eigenlijk een taak van de journalisten zou zijn), heb ik de cijfers bekeken van de slachtoffers in het Israël-Palestina conflict en vergeleken met de Amerikaanse inval in Irak. Let op: Amerika was niet uit op wraak op Irakeze burgers, maar wilde hen juist bevrijden van dictator Saddam Hoessein. Bij die invasie zijn minimaal 700.000 burgerdoden omgekomen, en meer recente bronnen hinten zelfs naar een miljoen. Dat zijn dan nog alleen de burgerdoden. Sinds de intifada van 2008 registreert de VN het totaal aantal dodelijke slachtoffers in het Palestijns-Israëlische conflict, zonder onderscheid te maken tussen terroristen en burgers. Tot de recente confrontatie was dat een totaalaantal van 6.269. Dat is in een periode van 15 jaar nog niet eens 7% van aantal burgerdoden van de invasie in Irak. Het toont aan dat de Israeli’s bizar slechte moordenaars zijn, of dat het verwijt dat hen gemaakt wordt gewoon een leugen is. Tel daarbij op dat de geschiedenis van de afgelopen eeuwen laat zien dat Joden ondanks alle onrecht dat hen aangedaan wordt afzien van wraak, en kijk naar de manier waarop zij en de Nederlanders die hun steunen vreedzaam bijeen kwamen op de Dam. En vergelijk dat dan met de uiterst agressieve manier waarop de sympathisanten van Hamas afgelopen zondag door de stad marcheerden, en de acties die het weekend daarvoor aan al deze ellende vooraf ging: de moord op meer dan 1200 burgers, waaronder overlevenden van de concentratiekampen, vaders, moeders, kinderen en babies. Van mijn ouders ken ik de verhalen van de vorige eeuw, waarin mensen met haat-mantra’s de straat op gingen en door de steden marcheerden.

facebook,"Con el corazón roto: La mamá fue asesinada, el papá fue herido y estuvo desaparecido hasta que identificaron su cuerpo, su hija de 3 años está desaparecida y probablemente secuestra en Gaza, sus otros 2 hijos sobrevivieron de forma heroica. Esta es la historia de la familia Idan que el mundo tiene que conocer. Roy Idan, fotógrafo periodístico, llegó a filmar a los terroristas de Hamas que invadieron el sur de Israel el 7/10. Luego regresó a su casa con su familia. Pero los terroristas también llegaron. Los terroristas del Hamas asesinaron a su esposa Smadar frente a sus hijos: Michael, de 9 años, Amalia de 6 años y Abigail de 3 años. A Roy le dispararon y cayó al piso mientras tenía a Abigail en brazos. Estaba desaparecido desde entonces, hasta que hoy identificaron su cuerpo. Michael, de apenas 9 años, actuó de forma heroica y llamó a los servicios de emergencia y les dijo lo que había pasado y que habían terroristas cerca de su casa y necesitaba ayuda. La mujer que atendió la llamada entendió la situación y le dijo al niño que se escondiera junto a su hermana. Este niño, de solo 9 años, agarró a su hermana Amalia de 6 años y se escondieron juntos en el closet por 14 horas. 14 horas! Sin comida. Sin agua. Sin sus padres. Se quedaron ahí, en silencio, hasta que alguien llegó a rescatarlos. La hermana pequeña de 3 años está desaparecida desde entonces y probablemente está secuestrada en Gaza. Oramos por Abigail y por el bienestar de todos los secuestrados. Elevamos una plegaria por las almas de todos los que fueron masacrados de forma salvaje por el Hamas. #HamasEsISIS #Liberenlos",,2395,"{'like_count': 340, 'comment_count': 168, 'num_users': 773367}",Israel en Español,,2023-10-18 22:26:01,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/242858613_225552479610728_3331739976897732393_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_p50x50&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=-UoWv_EpsQkAX8WahBJ&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBXKrGUko0eg336PbQnq1ncMCJe4FCPHBO_KpUNETvNZw&oe=655A20E2,https://www.facebook.com/100064679317493/posts/753911063441531,https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/393487556_753910853441552_3357729174239944507_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p720x720&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=fx7B3GQCW-IAX9xz2bX&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AfDZTNETOX8Bfpc-5pWmDvbMZs0glbEc4mg0DarZbtKW2w&oe=65522624

Many of us wouldn’t think about it twice to display our support for political candidates… I am asking you, lets do it for our people. Let’s not be afraid to show who we are, this is a time to stand up and be proud, not to be silent and be scared!!! Starting tomorrow afternoon you can come by The Temple’s office to pick up a sign or multiple signs. We suggest a donation of $18.00 per sign. The money raised will be sent directly to Magen David Adom.

facebook,"Ci sono decine di morti: erano donne, bambini, persone che che avevano trovato rifugio in un ospedale di Gaza. Credo che presto saranno chiare le responsabilità e si capirà chi è stato davvero a compiere questo atto infame: con le nuove tecnologie è possibile. Conoscete la mia posizione politica: Hamas è responsabile della tragedia che si è riaperta da sabato scorso, Israele ha il diritto di difendersi rispettando le regole del diritto internazionale.

facebook,"Bumbling Joe in Israel: Will the World Move Behind the ""LaRouche Solution""? Biden has offered complete support to Netanyahu in his drive for vengeance in response to a horrific attack by Hamas on Israel. So how many have to die in Gaza to fulfill the desperate Bibi's blood-lust? There is a growing consensus to use diplomacy to find a two-state solution -- but Netanyahu has funded Hamas since 2009 to prevent a unified Palestinian position, fearing that with Palestinian unity, a solution could be found. And Biden is too committed to use war to defend the Unipolar Order to look for a diplomatic solution.

instagram,"An explosion at a hospital in Gaza killed at least 500 people on Tuesday, Reuters said quoting the Hamas-run health ministry sources, sparking outrage. Local authorities blamed Israeli airstrikes, while Israel alleged it was Hamas rockets misfiring.

Netanyahu backed the claim and blamed Islamic Jihad militants for the attack.

""An analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,"" he posted on social media platform X.

""Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza,"" he added.

Riyad Mansour vehemently disputed Netanyahu's assertions.

""He is a liar,"" Mansour declared, ""His digital spokesperson tweeted that Israel did the hit thinking that there was a base for Hamas around this hospital, and then he deleted that tweet. We have a copy of that tweet... Now they changed the story to try to blame the Palestinians.""

US President Joe Biden is set to land in Israel on Wednesday, to show solidarity with the people of the country in the aftermath of the terrorist attack by Hamas. However, Biden had to abruptly scrap his trip to Jordan after the Palestinian authorities cancelled the summit following a huge explosion at a hospital in Gaza, which killed hundreds of civilians. Though Israel has denied its involvement in the bombing, the Palestinians have held it responsible.

More than 4,000 people have so far died on both sides, since the war between Israel and Hamas, the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides, began on October 7.

instagram,"This image shows a grief-stricken woman in Khan Younis with her arms wrapped around the body of a Palestinian child who was killed in an Israeli air strike.

At least 49 Palestinians were killed in strikes that hit homes in Rafah and Khan Younis on Tuesday, Gaza’s interior ministry said.

And in the evening, the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 471 Palestinian were killed in a massive explosion at a crowded hospital in Gaza City. It was the biggest single loss of life in the blockaded territory in all the five wars between Hamas and Israel since the militants took over the strip in 2007.

Officials in Gaza blamed an Israeli airstrike. Israel has denied it was involved and released video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a missile misfire by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. The Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim, and the scale of the blast appeared to be outside the militant groups’ capabilities.

The bombardment on Gaza has continued without relenting since Hamas launched its surprise attack on southern Israel 12 days ago, which killed more than 1,300 Israelis.

During a visit to Tel Aviv today, the US president, Joe Biden, said Hamas “committed evils and atrocities that make Isis somewhat more rational”, and before leaving the country cautioned Israelis not to be consumed by rage, adding that the vast majority of Palestinians were not affiliated with the militant group.

Health authorities in Gaza say at least 3,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its series of retaliatory strikes after 7 October.

instagram,"Call it what it is: genocide.

The media’s biased narratives continue to perpetuate and justify the violence against Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs.

“But Hamas did this!”—is what Israel, who has been violently occupying Palestine for 75 years, keeps saying after they had publicly rejoiced about their own war crimes via Twitter. Abusers often blame their victims as they are harming them. The BBC said it themselves: Hamas doesn't have the kind of sophisticated equipment this bomb required. There were no secondary explosions so it was not a weapons store. The bomb that was dropped was, according to the Wall Street Journal, an American bomb, recently delivered by President Biden.

If you don't believe that the IDF would bomb a hospital— the WHO has said that 115 healthcare facilities have been attacked in Gaza already.

Stop the genocide and end apartheid. There is nothing in the world that can justify 900+ deaths of mainly children, women, men, doctors, nurses, and refugees. So far 1500 children have been murdered by Israeli and American bombs. 

So many folks have reached out, unable to speak up– the censorship and risk one faces when daring to denounce the illegal Israeli occupation and war crimes is profound. We are with you 💔

“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” said the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson.

Hamas immediately blamed Israelis for the airstrike, while Israel’s military said that part of a “barrage of rockets” fired by the Islamic Jihad militant group erroneously hit the area.

After arriving in Israel on Wednesday, Biden said he’d seen material that suggested the strike was “done by the other team, not you.”

instagram,"I keep thinking about the 199 hostages. 
My friend @noatishby organized for a group of us to tape posters of all the hostages in Times Square. Looking at their faces, 6 year old, 83 year old it became so real. People walking by would stop and spend some time with them. My heart hurts for the families of these innocents- Muslim, Christian, Jewish -all. The most important thing is the rescue of these hostages. 

I am grateful that @POTUS’s trip has ensured that humanitarian aid will get to every person living Gaza by negotiating free passage from Egypt.

It’s hard to process that Hamas refused to take care of the Palestinians. Blocking aid from getting to them, blocking them from leaving. They could have opened passage into Gaza immediately. They chose not too. It illustrates the lack of humanity within Hamas’ cell. Of course, the Oct 7th  terror attack was the most barbaric, blood thirsty massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. I pray that they are defeated. The entire globe will be safer. 

Please pray for the hostages safe return and the defeat of Hamas. Pray for the physical safety of all the innocent Palestinians and Israelis who are suffering. 
Pray for peace everywhere. 

And a personal request that young, passionate, far left students leave the posters up. There are videos of these posters being ripped down. That does nothing but hurt the families who want us all to remember their loved ones, as they await news.

Pray for peace. 

[we have since learned the grandmother in the poster I’m hanging is dead. As is her little granddaughter. May they rest in peace.]

Israel has put Gaza under a total siege and subjected it to intense bombardment.

The Gaza health ministry says Israeli air strikes have killed more than 3,000 since then.

instagram,"O Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) respondeu nesta terça-feira (17) à declaração da Embaixada de Israel no Brasil, classificando-a como 'totalmente falsa e maliciosa'.

A legenda, liderada por Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, defendeu sua posição quanto ao conflito Israel-Palestina, destacando que condena tanto os ataques do grupo terrorista palestino Hamas quanto as ações do governo israelense, atribuindo ao último a acusação de 'genocídio' na Faixa de Gaza.

O PT havia se pronunciado anteriormente condenando os ""ataques inaceitáveis, assassinatos e sequestro de civis, cometidos tanto pelo Hamas quanto pelo Estado de Israel"", enfatizando que a retaliação israelense constituía ""um genocídio contra a população de Gaza, por meio de um conjunto de crimes de guerra"".

A nota da legenda ainda destacou que, no momento em que a Embaixada de Israel divulgou sua declaração, centenas de civis eram mortos no bombardeio a um hospital em Gaza, argumentando que a representação israelense no Brasil não tem ""autoridade moral para falar em direitos humanos"".

O PT rejeitou a interpretação de que seu posicionamento equipara a violência brutal do Hamas a uma 'posição política' ou a uma 'luta política legítima'.

If confirmed, the attack would be by far the deadliest Israeli airstrike in five wars fought since 2008. Photos from al-Ahli Hospital showed fire engulfing the hospital halls, shattered glass and body parts scattered across the area. The ministry said at least 500 people had been killed. Several hospitals in Gaza City have become refuges for hundreds of people, hoping they would be spared bombardment after Israel ordered all residents of the city and surrounding areas to evacuate to the southern Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed condolences, he said: ""Deeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured.""

Ama bu demek değil ki topraklarımızda yaşayan Türk vatandaşı Musevi vatandaşlarımızın hayatını zindana çevirelim. Sapla samanı birbirinden ayıralım. Bu yaşananlarda yıllardır bu topraklarda yaşayan, komşumuz, dostumuz olan insanların bir alakası yok. Onları hedef göstermeyelim

Hem İsrail hükümeti hem Hamas, masum sivillerin ölümünden sorumludur. Cezalarını er ya da geç çekecekler. Evet, 7 Ekim'den beri devam eden beri devam eden bu olaylar hakkında pek bir şey yazmadım. Buradan yazmanın savaşın gidişatına bir katkısı olacağına inanmadım, samimiyetsiz buldum. Olaylar ne sizin ne benim burada yazdığım iki cümleyle duracak noktada değil. Hem İsrail’in hem Hamas’ın yaptığı vahşettir. Bunu durduracak olan da uluslararası hukuktur. Devlet liderleridir, müzakereleredir, yaptırımlardır

Usai ledakan di RS al-Ahli, 350 ambulans dan mobil pribadi bergegas menuju RS al-Shifa di Gaza Tengah untuk menyelamatkan korban luka. Al-Shifa sendiri sebenarnya telah kewalahan dengan semua pasien mereka. Para korban dalam kondisi berdarah-darah tergeletak di lantai rumah sakit, sementara RS kehabisan obat, bius, dan bahan bakar.⁠
⁠
“Peristiwa ini mengerikan karena orang-orang ini, semuanya, adalah warga sipil. Mereka mengungsi ke tempat yang dikira aman. Rumah sakit, menurut hukum internasional, adalah tempat yang aman,” kata dr. Ziad Shehadah kepada Al Jazeera. ⁠
⁠
“Mereka meninggalkan rumah karena merasa sudah tidak aman, lalu berlindung di gedung-gedung sekolah dan RS. Tapi dalam sekejap, mereka semua terbunuh di RS,” tambahnya.⁠
⁠
“Mayat-mayat bergelimpangan di jalan. Bangunan yang ada di permukiman kami luluh lantak,” kata Jamil Abdullah, warga Palestina-Swedia yang berharap bisa segera keluar dari pengepungan total ini, kepada AFP. “Bau mayat di mana-mana.”⁠
⁠
Pada Selasa (17/10), memasuki hari ke-11 sejak Hamas menyerang Israel, serangan balasan dari Israel telah menewaskan 3.000 orang, termasuk 1.032 anak perempuan dan 940 anak laki-laki. Sebanyak 12.500 orang terluka, serta lebih dari 1.000 orang, entah hidup atau mati, masih terperangkap di bawah puing-puing bangunan. Sebanyak 11 jurnalis turut tewas akibat serangan Israel. ⁠
⁠
Jumlah korban ini telah melewati total korban 51 hari konflik Gaza-Israel pada 2014. Demikian banyaknya korban membuat Gaza kini sampai mengalami krisis kantung jenazah.⁠
⁠
The World Food Programme mengatakan, di Perbatasan Rafah yang menjadi satu-satunya pintu masuk Gaza dari Mesir, truk-truk pengangkut bantuan, termasuk 300 ton makanan, masih menunggu bisa masuk Gaza.⁠
⁠
Sejak Senin pekan lalu (9/10), Israel menyetop suplai makanan, air, dan bahan bakar ke Gaza yang dihuni 2,3 juta penduduk. Hingga Selasa (17/10), Israel masih tak kunjung menghentikan pengepungan total meski telah mendapat kecaman internasional.⁠

Israel y Hamas se acusan mutuamente de la autoría de un ataque que ha despertado la indignación internacional. No se sabe cuántos personas murieron en la explosión en este hospital de Gaza, pero las escenas que llegan de la zona muestran algo evidente: de nuevo los más pequeños están siendo víctimas de crímenes de guerra.

Estos retratos representan la desolación ante un conflicto que ha sumido a Gaza en una crisis humanitaria sin precedentes. 

“No hay lugar más solitario en el mundo que la cama de un niño herido que ya no tiene familia que le cuide”, ha escrito en redes sociales Ghassan Abu Sittah, un cirujano plástico y reconstructivo británico que trabaja actualmente en el hospital al-Shifa.

Os gritos de socorro ecoam em meio à destruição causada por bombas lançadas na Faixa de Gaza. Debaixo dos escombros, sobreviventes de ataques clamam para ser salvos, segundo relato à BBC News Brasil do tradutor palestino Kayed Hammad, que está em Gaza (a foto do post não é dele e sim de outro morador de Gaza desesperado com a situação).

Hammad conta que cidadãos escutam os pedidos de ajuda, mas permanecem inertes diante da situação. ""E nem mesmo os bombeiros conseguem ajudar, porque não há ferramentas para salvar essas pessoas. E estar ali tentando ajudar também é arriscar a própria vida.""

Ele afirma que as pessoas agonizam sob os escombros à espera de algum tipo de resgate ou até mesmo da morte.

Na reportagem completa do www.bbcbrasil.como você vai saber, pelo relato de Hammad, como está a situação de quem mora no norte da Faixa de Gaza.

instagram,"The U.S. has collected “high confidence” signals intelligence showing that the explosion at a Gaza hospital compound on Tuesday was caused by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, U.S. officials said, buttressing Israel’s contention that it wasn’t responsible for the blast.⁠
⁠
The U.S. assessment drew, in part, on communications intercepts and other intelligence gathered by the U.S., defense officials said.⁠
⁠
“Our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza,” White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said, adding that the U.S. continues to collect information on the incident.⁠
⁠
“I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team—not you,” President Biden said Wednesday while alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.⁠
⁠
U.S. officials added that Israel shared its own independent intelligence assessment with the U.S. shortly before Biden departed to Israel, partially in an effort to exonerate itself.⁠
⁠
Biden later told reporters that he made his statement based on “the data I was shown by my defense department.” The Pentagon referred questions to the White House.⁠
⁠
Arab leaders continued to assert that Israel was responsible for the explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, which according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry killed nearly 471 people.⁠
⁠
The accounts of the blast and the death toll couldn’t be independently verified. A toll of nearly 500 would make it the single deadliest incident in Gaza since the start of the war.⁠

Biden desembarcó del Air Force One a las 11.01 a.m., hora local, y saludó con abrazos al primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, y al presidente de ese país, Isaac Herzog, antes de estrechar la mano de la encargada de negocios de la embajada estadounidense, Stephanie Hallett.

Durante una reunión bilateral con Netanyahu, Biden dijo al dirigente israelí que el mortífero estallido en un hospital de Gaza “parece como si lo hubiera hecho el otro equipo, no usted”.

Con su visita, Biden busca demostrar su apoyo incondicional a Israel mientras trabaja para eliminar a Hamas y al mismo tiempo presionar para encontrar formas de aliviar el sufrimiento humanitario en Gaza.

instagram,"An explosion at a hospital in Gaza killed at least 500 people on Tuesday, Reuters said quoting the Hamas-run health ministry sources, sparking outrage. Local authorities blamed Israeli airstrikes, while Israel alleged it was Hamas rockets misfiring.

Netanyahu backed the claim and blamed Islamic Jihad militants for the attack.

""An analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,"" he posted on social media platform X.

""Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza,"" he added.

Riyad Mansour vehemently disputed Netanyahu's assertions.

""He is a liar,"" Mansour declared, ""His digital spokesperson tweeted that Israel did the hit thinking that there was a base for Hamas around this hospital, and then he deleted that tweet. We have a copy of that tweet... Now they changed the story to try to blame the Palestinians.""

US President Joe Biden is set to land in Israel on Wednesday, to show solidarity with the people of the country in the aftermath of the terrorist attack by Hamas. However, Biden had to abruptly scrap his trip to Jordan after the Palestinian authorities cancelled the summit following a huge explosion at a hospital in Gaza, which killed hundreds of civilians. Though Israel has denied its involvement in the bombing, the Palestinians have held it responsible.

More than 4,000 people have so far died on both sides, since the war between Israel and Hamas, the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides, began on October 7.

instagram,"A senior official at the US State Department issued his resignation on Wednesday evening, citing the Biden administration's approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

""Let me be clear: Hamas' attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities,"" Josh Paul said in a letter, which was posted on X by Brian Finucane, a senior adviser at Crisis Group.

""But I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response, and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people - and is not in the long term American interest.

Paul worked for more than 10 ears in the State Department's Political-Military Affairs bureau, which is in charge of approving arms transfers to other countries.

Biden has been clear in stating that he will support
Israel unequivocally as it takes action against
Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, which on 7 October launched a surprise attack on Israel.

The war has so far killed more than 3,000 Palestinians, including around 1,000 children and 1,000 women, while also killing more than 1,400 Israelis.

MEE reported last week that the White House's phrasing of any calls for a ceasefire were ""repugnant"", sending a chilling message to progressive lawmakers and anti-war activists.

The Biden administration is currently drafting a major foreign aid bill that would include $10b for Israel. In addition to the aid package, the US has also deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern Mediterranean and has readied 2,000 American troops to be deployed in order to support Israel, as the country readies for a ground invasion of Gaza.

""I cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse, Paul said further in his letter.",,23879,"{'like_count': 23585, 'comment_count': 294, 'num_users': 779489}",Ahmed Eldin | أحمد شهاب الدين,,2023-10-18 23:21:56,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/385875133_3637252009930162_319884512059397872_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=amaMK5nlvyMAX9W8qB7&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfB7Hp0ElAjB8egKBV9Qqdxc1keX8wXiZkWPqsINse7F9A&oe=655A9CB0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyjvTXCIKVg/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/393921626_18394135894008933_4657402237746734529_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=DYxSBO2bkxkAX-732m5&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDSyG0Lug1dIrYbNJyEXVOD9CCUDpm3dV27rRdbfHEVUw&oe=655AEF83

instagram,"O embaixador de Israel no Brasil, Daniel Zonshine, criticou o Partido dos Trabalhadores pela nota publicada na segunda (16) em que disse que o país faz um ‘genocídio’ de palestinos ao contra-atacar o grupo terrorista Hamas na Faixa de Gaza. O conflito, que começou dia 7, já vitimou mais de 4 mil pessoas.

A resposta do embaixador é duro e coloca o partido do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva em situação complicada. O texto contesta a afirmação de que o PT valoriza os direitos humanos, sendo que o grupo terrorista os violou ao “matar crianças e estuprar mulheres”. Para Zonshine, defender os palestinos é diferente de apoiar o Hamas.

Daniel Zonshine rechaçou a posição do partido e disse que o PT “perdeu toda a visão de humanidade”.

O embaixador israelense disse, ainda, que o país não aceitará nenhum tipo de resolução que declare um cessar-fogo nos dois lados da guerra, e que isso seria um “prêmio para o Hamas”.

“Até este momento, não foi concluída [uma alternativa] para a saída ser feita de maneira segura”, sustentou sobre os cerca de dois mil estrangeiros que aguardam a passagem pelo posto de controle da cidade de Rafah, ao Sul de Gaza.

Por fim, Zonshine destacou que Israel tem informações de que o Irã ajudou o Hamas no ataque do dia 7.",,20426,"{'like_count': 19897, 'comment_count': 529, 'num_users': 1186397}",CONEXÃO POLÍTICA,,2023-10-18 14:35:29,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/277791704_682161956446370_7810684516567234256_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=85DAb4k4dwAAX_dMcFY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBNvjwDJTUNg4kpnM1YDp-qqKLHA-nBQfoXHOU4R6JDPw&oe=655BCE57,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyizDj8rHxM/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393357716_272988828446869_4728314738602144740_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=gEDRoSYgFvsAX9GCiG-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDAVap157_j1dajM4y2Z-yKB18vy8P82ajOUxUwLwdXfg&oe=6541D819

Menteri Luar Negeri Kolombia, Alvaro Leyva meminta duta besar Israel untuk meninggalkan negaranya  karena konflik Israel dengan Hamas hingga membombardir Jalur Gaza. Permintaan itu sehari setelah Presiden Kolombia Gustavo Petro mengancam akan menangguhkan hubungan dengan Israel, karena keputusan mereka menghentikan ekspor bahan keamanan ke Kolombia.

Melalui presidennya, Kolombia menyatakan penolakan terhadap bombardir Israel di Gaza dan menjanjikan bantuan kemanusiaan ke Gaza, di mana ribuan orang telah kehilangan nyawa akibat serangan udara yang dilakukan Israel. Israel sendiri berhenti mengekspor amunisi senjata ke Kolombia karena negara tersebut tidak mau mengecam Hamas. Dengan menggunakan akun X (Twitter) miliknya, Leyva menuntut rasa hormat dari Dubes Israel kepada Presiden Kolombia dan menuduh Dagan bersikap ""kasar"".

Bagaimana tanggapanmu mengenai tindakan yang dilakukan Kolombia terhadap Duta Besar Israel?

Vatandaş gururun ve kutlamanın ne olduğunu biliyor, savaşın ortasında hayatını kaybeden masum canlar ve çocukların insan olana verdiği dayanılmaz acıyı da hissediyor…

İkisini ayırmasını hepimiz biliyoruz.

Ama Cumhuriyet bu.

Ve 100. yıl…

Aslında son 10-15 güne sığdırılmayacak kadar olağan dışı bir takvim düzenlenmesi gerekirdi. Onu da geçtik, 100. yılını bakalım kaç güne sıkıştıracaklar koskoca Cumhuriyet'in!..

Evet, bir kısım etkinlik ertelenmiş…

Ne alâka?

Ne hakla?..

instagram,"Kemarin, rumah sakit Al-Ahli di Gaza dibom. Lebih dari 500 orang meninggal dari serangan itu.

Ledakan ini diduga berasal dari serangan udara pihak Israel, dan mengundang kecaman banyak pemimpin dunia. Kemlu kita juga buka suara, ""Indonesia mengutuk keras serangan Israel terhadap RS Al-Ahli. Serangan tersebut jelas melanggar hukum humaniter internasional"".

Tapi, Israel justru membantah tuduhannya. ""Kita tidak menyerangnya"", kata Letkol Jonathan Conricus, juru bicara Pasukan Pertahanan Israel. Pihak Israel justru menyalahkan roket Hamas yang salah sasaran atas kejadian tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, warga sipil tetep aja gak boleh jadi target perang. Konvensi Jenewa juga ngelarang serangan ke rumah sakit, bahkan bila rumah sakit itu juga digunakan buat merawat anggota militer.

instagram,"The Biden administration plans to ask Congress for $100 billion in Ukraine and Israel aid, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The outlet reported:

President Joe Biden is considering a supplemental request of approximately $100 billion that would include defense assistance for Israel and Ukraine alongside border security funding and aid to nations in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan, according to people familiar with the matter.

Biden has pledged support for Israel in the wake of the deadly attack earlier this month by Hamas, a group designated by the US and EU as a terrorist organization. Aid for Israel enjoys broad bipartisan support in the US Congress.

There has been speculation since Hamas attacked Israel that the administration would try to tie funding for Ukraine and Israel together after House Republicans successfully stripped funding for Ukraine from a short-term government funding bill. That request was only $24 billion compared to the $100 billion it is now asking for to fund both contingencies and reportedly Taiwan. Donald Trump Jr. @donaldjtrumpjr chimed in on the matter, posting on X, “How about NO!!!!” The package would also include border security funding aimed at getting Republicans on board.

Cody Sargent, a spokesman for the conservative Heritage Foundation @heritagefoundation , posted:

This “border security” funding is a trap. It would give Biden more money to speed up his conveyor belt of illegal immigrants into the country — not turn off the flow.

No conservative can support border funding without policy change. According to Bloomberg, the details of the package are still being worked out, and it is intended to cover an entire fiscal year.

Punchbowl News reporter Andrew Desiderio posted on X that the funds would be for a “full year.”

“Can confirm the $100 billion number has been floating around the Hill today as senators wait for the final package,” he posted.

“Important to note this number is for a full year, so the Ukraine portion will be massive,” he wrote.",,18593,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 8593, 'num_users': 1763408}",Breitbart,,2023-10-18 02:27:16,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/13551627_1574264712878053_190076427_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=JAAg8UNZ8AcAX-mMSa1&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAI5_EdvpV5S_fAju6ibG4mVySFTWyYvNAj1uv665mTLg&oe=655B2285,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyhft8TM19P/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392724966_2241704019357021_6647450472473848654_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ESZSqL2ZebkAX86_1FN&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAXmZu_zco0uWCDHjSrnJYqHcOCaQXH80TY5OMkAZMAdg&oe=6535C00F

instagram,"President Joe Biden cautioned the Israeli government to avoid being 'consumed' by 'rage' in his remarks from Tel Aviv on October 18.

Biden traveled to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid the growing Israel-Gaza conflict. During his remarks, Biden referenced 9/11 and admitted that the United States was enraged after the terrorist attack and 'made mistakes' while seeking justice. 

'But I caution this while you feel that rage: Don't be consumed by it,' Biden said. 'After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes ... I know the choices are never clear or easy for leadership. There's always cost. But it requires being deliberate. It requires asking very hard questions. It requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives.'

Biden didn't specify what mistakes, but many have assumed he was alluding to the U.S.'s invasion of Iraq after 9/11, which he supported as a senator at the time, but has since said was a mistake. The Iraq War destabilized the region for years and led to an enormous loss of civilian life, estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.

Critics argued that Biden's warning came off as somewhat hollow, given his administration’s substantial military aid to Israel. His remarks glossed over the stark power disparity between Israel and Palestine and failed to sufficiently address the humanitarian crisis unfolding in real time, they said.

In his address, Biden went on to urge the Israeli war cabinet to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza, predicated on inspections to ensure the aid bypasses Hamas. He stressed, 'The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people.' Following this appeal, Israel agreed to allow the entry of aid into Gaza.

However, detractors pointed out that these stringent conditions on aid might inadvertently perpetuate the cycle of violence and hamper efforts to achieve a sustainable cease-fire and lasting peace.

instagram,"O Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas (ONU) votou e reprovou uma resolução sugerida por diplomatas comandados pelo presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) sobre a guerra entre o Hamas e Israel. O texto foi vetado pelos Estados Unidos porque não reconhecia o direito de Israel de se defender da agressão terrorista iniciada no último dia 7.

O documento em votação nesta quarta-feira (18) contou com 12 votos favoráveis, duas abstenções e a rejeição dos Estados Unidos. Por ser um membro permanente e possuir poder de veto, a resolução foi rejeitada. Esta foi a segunda resolução sobre o conflito votada pelo Conselho de Segurança nesta semana.

Além de apontar que o texto proposto pelo Brasil não reconhecia o direito de Israel de se defender, Washington justificou seu veto afirmando que a principal tentativa de resolução está sendo feita neste momento pelo presidente Joe Biden, que está em Israel nesta quarta-feira (18).

""Os Estados Unidos está decepcionado com essa resolução pois ela não meciona os direitos do povo israelense de se defesa como qualquer outra nação no mundo — o que está descrito no artigo 51 da Carta das Nações Unidas"", disse a embaixadora dos Estados Unidos na ONU, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

""Sejamos claros: as próprias acções do Hamas provocaram isto – esta grave crise humanitária em Gaza. E o Hamas causou muito sofrimento, morte e destruição desnecessários. Todos os Estados-Membros deveriam condenar o terrorismo e a crueldade do Hamas. E todos os Estados-Membros deveriam apelar ao Hamas para que cesse a sua interminável barragem de foguetes contra Israel. Isto não é complicado. Não é controverso. Este é o mínimo"", pontuou Greenfield.

Lula havia se envolvido pessoalmente na negociação com líderes regionais, como o presidente egípcio, Abdel Fattah al-Sissi e com líder da Autoridade Palestina, Mahmoud Abbas. Tratava-se de um esforço do presidente alegadamente para tornar o Brasil mais relevante no cenário internacional, mas que poderia favorecer muito a imagem de Lula.

instagram,"An explosion at the Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital in Gaza on Tuesday evening killed hundreds of Palestinians, leading to mass confusion and blame over what led to the explosion. Hamas immediately blamed an Israel airstrike while Israeli has come out and said that based on their evidence, it appears to have been a misfired rocket from Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 

We’ve compiled the evidence released so far that the explosion was most likely caused by a misfire by the Islamic Jihad, another terrorist organization that operates out of Gaza.

Israeli aerial footage shows there was no direct hit at the hospital from a missile from any source, and the Islamic Jihad rockets hit the hospital car park. There were no craters or damage to the hospital building which would have been the case with an aerial strike, while intercepted calls between Hamas operatives prove the existence of the Islamic Jihad assault. Additionally, an IDF spokesperson said Hamas had inflated the casualty numbers and said the group could not know as quickly as it claimed what caused the blast.

Biden said U.S. defense officials have intelligence that backs Israel's understanding of the cause of the explosion, and that the blast came from the Palestinian side. ""Based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,"" Biden said referring to the Israelis. Hamas denies all responsibility but has so far not released evidence backing up their claim it was Israel.

instagram,"“We’ve always been supporting the Palestinians in their struggle to realise their rights. Bangladesh stands by Palestine,” she told representatives of OIC countries in Dhaka on Oct 18.

On October 7, a Hamas attack inside Israel sparked a violent Tel Aviv counterattack that has resulted in nearly 3,500 Palestinian deaths and thousands of injuries. On the other hand, the conflict has claimed the lives of more than 1,300 Israeli citizens.

At least 300 people were killed in the allegedly Israeli-led bombing of a Gaza hospital on Tuesday, many of them children. Despite Tel Aviv and its ally the US denying it, the Arab world condemned the attack and blamed Israel for it. Bangladesh condemned the attack on the Ahli Arabi Hospital and charged Israel with committing a ""grave crime against humanity"" and a ""criminal act."" Dhaka said in a forceful statement that those responsible for this criminal act must be held accountable for their deeds.

Dhaka said this ruthless attack is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian laws and accords “which constitutes a grave crime against humanity”. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Hasina has ordered sending medicine to Palestine on an urgent basis.

instagram,"Es geht gerade richtig viel durcheinander. Einiges ist einfach falsch. Die eine Seite schreibt mir beispielsweise, die Angst von Juden*Jüdinnen vor Angriffen letzten Freitag (""Tag der Wut"" den die Hamas ausgerufen hatte) sei bloß eingebildet und irgendwie rassistisch. Ich finde das ist gaslighting, bei der man dem Opfer einredet, seine Wahrnehmung sei gar nicht real. Die Angriffe auf jüdische Einrichtungen letzte Nacht in Berlin haben einmal mehr gezeigt, dass es sich um eine reale Bedrohung handelt.

Die andere Seite nimmt die aktuelle Zuspitzung zum Anlass, alle Muslim*innen für antisemitische Angriffe oder sogar Antisemitismus im Allgemeinen verantwortlich zu machen. Das ist nicht nur falsch, sondern auch super gefährlich. Es leben 5,5 Millionen Muslim*innen in Deutschland. Und ich erlebe super viel Support für Juden*Jüdinnen und Abgrenzung von dem Terror der Hamas. Und die AfD läuft gerade auf 25 Prozent Wähler*innenzustimmung zu. 

Lasst uns also auf die gemeinsame Menschlichkeit fokussieren und den gemeinsamen Wunsch, keine Gewalt zu erleben.

instagram,"Bei einem Raketeneinschlag auf einem Krankenhausgelände in Gaza-Stadt sind offenbar Hunderte Menschen getötet oder verletzt worden. Die von der militant-islamistischen Hamas kontrollierte Gesundheitsbehörde machte die israelische Armee dafür verantwortlich. Israels Militär wies die Verantwortung zurück: „Das Krankenhaus wurde durch eine fehlgeschlagene Rakete der Terrororganisation Islamischer Dschihad getroffen“, teilte die Armee mit. 

Mehrere arabische Staaten machten Israel für den Angriff verantwortlich. Der palästinensische Präsident Abbas rief zu einer dreitägigen Staatstrauer auf und sprach von Völkermord. Saudi-Arabien verurteilte das „abscheuliche Verbrechen“ aufs Schärfste. Auch Länder wie Iran, Jordanien und die Türkei gaben Israel die Schuld für die Explosion. In mehreren muslimisch geprägten Ländern kam es zu Protesten. Auch in Berlin gingen Menschen auf die Straße. Dabei kam es zu Zusammenstößen mit der Polizei. 

Weltweit sorgt der Vorfall für Entsetzen – zahlreiche Staaten und Organisationen forderten Aufklärung. Das Auswärtige Amt in Berlin schrieb. „Wir sind zutiefst erschüttert über die Berichte von Hunderten von Toten im Al-Ahli-Krankenhaus in Gaza. Zivile Ziele, insbesondere ein voll funktionsfähiges Krankenhaus mit Patienten und medizinischem Personal, dürfen unter keinen Umständen angegriffen werden. Zivilisten müssen in Konflikten geschützt werden.“

instagram,"Debate internacional - Os Estados Unidos rejeitaram nesta quarta-feira (18) o texto proposto pelo Brasil no Conselho de Segurança da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) sobre o conflito entre Israel e Hamas.

Na votação, os Estados Unidos vetaram a resolução brasileira, por conta de uma mudança no texto proposta pela Rússia, a de incluir um pedido de cessar-fogo imediato. A votação teve o seguinte resultado:

➙ Doze países votaram a favor do texto - entre eles França e China.
➙ Apenas um país - os Estados Unidos - votou contra.
➙ E dois - Rússia e Reino Unido - se abstiveram.

Como os EUA são um membro permanente do conselho e têm poder de veto, o texto não foi aprovado, apesar da votação a favor de outros países.

A embaixadora dos Estados Unidos na ONU argumentou que seu país ficou ""desapontado"" pelo fato de o texto não mencionar o direito de autodefesa de Israel.

instagram,"Pope Francis at the end of his general audience on Wednesday morning announced another day of prayer and fasting for an end to the Israel-Hamas war. ⁣
⁣
“I have decided to call for a day of fasting and prayer on Friday, Oct. 27,” the pope said.⁣
⁣
It will be “a day of penance to which I invite sisters and brothers of the various Christian denominations, those belonging to other religions, and all those who have at heart the cause of peace in the world, to join in as they see fit,” the Holy Father continued.⁣
⁣
The vigil will take place at 6 p.m. in St. Peter’s Square, where the faithful will join the pope to participate in “an hour of prayer in a spirit of penance to implore peace in our time, peace in this world. I ask all the particular Churches to participate by arranging similar activities involving the people of God,” the pope said.⁣
⁣
Pope Francis and Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, have jointly appealed for prayer and fasting in response to the escalating conflict in the Holy Land. They are seeking divine intervention to restore peace, justice, and reconciliation to the region. ⁣
⁣
Pope Francis expressed deep concern about the increasing number of casualties and dire conditions in Gaza, urging all possible efforts to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. He also emphasized the importance of stopping the use of weapons and listening to the calls for peace, especially from the most vulnerable. ⁣
⁣
The international community is watching closely as U.S. President Joe Biden engages in high-level talks in Israel, recognizing the need for urgent resolution and de-escalation.⁣

instagram,"Ontem ocorreu um desastre no hospital Al-Ahli, na Faixa de Gaza. Infelizmente, muitas entidades, incluindo partidos políticos, apressaram-se em culpar Israel sem qualquer prova, adotando a narrativa da organização terrorista Hamas. Israel, em contrapartida, esperou pelas conclusões da investigação, pelos vídeos e gravações provenientes de dentro de Gaza que foram publicados e mostram claramente que se tratou de um disparo equivocado de um foguete lançado pela organização Jihad Islâmica Palestina em Gaza . Ao contrário de outros, Israel é sempre obrigado a verificar os fatos antes de fazer uma declaração oficial. Sabemos que este tempo precioso nos custa nas redes sociais pois a falsa narrativa do Hamas é rapidamente adotada, mas estamos empenhados nos fatos e na verdade e não apenas em ganhar o apoio da opinião pública.
Às 18h59 de 17/10, uma barragem de foguetes foi disparada contra Israel a partir de um local de lançamento localizado em um cemitério próximo ao hospital. Momentos depois, espalhou-se a notícia de uma explosão no hospital em Gaza.
O Hamas notou rapidamente que se tratava de um lançamento falho da Jihad Islâmica e decidindo aproveitá-lo em benefício de uma campanha cínica contra Israel espalhando notícias falsas, em todos os canais, de que Israel tinha deliberadamente bombardeado um hospital em Gaza, matando centenas, incluindo crianças.
Esta manhã, as IDF divulgaram uma gravação e transcrição de uma conversa entre agentes do Hamas na qual foi claramente afirmado que se tratava de um lançamentro fracassado da Jihad Islâmica.
Isto é um crime de guerra. O Hamas vê os residentes de Gaza apenas como uma ferramenta para atingir os seus objetivos e, de fato, se aproveita destas situações para chantagear Israel enquanto tenta responsabilizá-lo por causar danos a civis.
Qualquer pessoa que tenha feito eco das reivindicações do Hamas sem qualquer comprovação ou crítica merece toda a reprovação. Fazer eco das afirmações de uma organização terrorista como se fossem verdadeiras e lançar acusações infundadas contra Israel é perigoso e irresponsável.",,13163,"{'like_count': 12489, 'comment_count': 674, 'num_users': 242734}",Israel no Brasil,,2023-10-18 13:47:04,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/263454901_131683685942002_4509948350291233711_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=4JXgQpEMQKYAX9nCXvn&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBo1S8AWkkYM0anLdPU0quYRia4Y9SVXjNzpowF2l-pYQ&oe=655B9C65,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyitg43LKSo/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392911154_340624641770556_8153308475885819647_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=NifPfqW0JnUAX_GHrol&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAK3sg4E9GNNKlqgkSe3_0hSfdXU6M-g7cAncI9CCcEJg&oe=653DED7C

instagram,"VOTAÇÃO NA ONU 🇺🇳 Os Estados Unidos vetaram, de forma isolada, nesta quarta-feira, 18, uma proposta de resolução patrocinada pelo Brasil sobre a guerra entre Israel e o grupo terrorista Hamas, no Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas. O projeto previa pausas humanitárias no confronto e condenada os ataques terroristas. 

A resolução teve 12 votos a favor, 1 veto e 2 abstenções - de Rússia e Reino Unido. Dos membros permanentes, China e França votaram a favor do projeto brasileiro, como haviam indicado na véspera.

Segundo a diplomacia dos EUA, o veto se deve à ausência de menção ao direito de autodefesa de Israel, apoiado por Washington. Os Estados Unidos têm poder de veto por ser um dos membros permanentes do Conselho, ao lado de Rússia, China, Reino Unido e França.

“Os EUA estão desapontados que a resolução não cita o direito de autodefesa de Israel. Não podemos apoiar o avanço dessa resolução, mas continuaremos a trabalhar com os membros do conselho”, disse a embaixadora Linda Thomas Greenfield. “Estamos no terreno fazendo o trabalho duro da diplomacia.”

instagram,"O Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas rejeitou nesta quarta (18) uma resolução proposta pelo Brasil, na qualidade de presidente do órgão, sobre o conflito entre Israel e Hamas. Houve 12 votos favoráveis, mas os EUA, que historicamente blindam Israel no conselho, vetaram a resolução.

A Rússia, que havia apresentado sua própria resolução e tentado fazer duas emendas ao texto brasileiro, se absteve, assim como o Reino Unido.

A embaixadora americana na ONU, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, justificou seu voto contrário à resolução pela ausência de uma afirmação do direito de Israel de se defender.

Diante da crescente pressão sobre o conselho para que reaja à escalada da violência na região, e do apoio majoritário ao texto brasileiro, o custo político do veto recai sobre os americanos.

""Tristemente, muito tristemente, o conselho mais uma vez não conseguiu adotar uma resolução. Silêncio e inação prevaleceram, para o interesse de longo prazo de ninguém"", disse o embaixador do Brasil na ONU, Sérgio Danese.

instagram,"Why are we so adamant in our distrust of the Israeli government? Because we are practiced in distrusting our own. The America that would expect me to be patriotic is as delusional as the Israel who thinks our rants against the state of Israel are antisemitic. Our stand is with humanity of all religions and against imperial and colonial powers that use religion and the false promise of democracy to sell us lies, to embolden our support for their deranged goals of maintaining power and increasing control/revenue. The state of Israel needs us to think they didn’t bomb the hospital because they need our empathy with their cause. They need us to think of Palestinians as violent savages who would bring this violence upon themselves. This is why they emboldened Hamas over the Palestinian Authority in the first place. Netanyahu’s tactics have gone from almost landing him in jail to boldly enacting the genocide of his dreams. The American president stands beside him because “if we didn’t have Israel we would have to invent one.” - as a foothold in the region. We recognize and reject these tactics. We have been forced to become historians, scholars, academics, poets, well versed in the hidden ways people have been manipulated, disenfranchised, coerced into accepting humanitarian aid from the paternalistic hands/governments that dehumanize them. This is exactly how they get you to throw your hands up and say “The Middle East is too complicated. Both sides…..” yet the US and Israel are two sides of the same coin. State powered terrorism is not a religious act and in this situation is not in defense of the weaker of parties. If we don’t want to see history repeat we need to do a careful rereading of history, check your sources, make sure the writers are not all men, have not all studied in the same school, under the same “experts”… Discernment and judgement play their respective roles. The propaganda machines are in full affect, they’ll change their stories after their goals have already played out, after you’ve thrown up your hands….

instagram,"ISRAEL X HAMAS - Por causa do  veto dos Estados Unidos, a resolução brasileira para o conflito entre Israel e Hamas não passou na votação desta quarta (18) do Conselho de Segurança da ONU. 

""De novo, o silêncio prevaleceu. Estamos profundamente tristes e decepcionados"", disse Sérgio Danese, embaixador do Brasil na ONU.

Na votação, os Estados Unidos vetaram a resolução brasileira, por conta de uma mudança no texto proposta pela Rússia, a de incluir um pedido de cessar-fogo imediato.

A sessão foi aberta pelo embaixador do Brasil na ONU. Em seguida, o representante da Rússia sugeriu duas mudanças ao texto, e a resolução foi para votação, e o resultado foi o seguinte:

🌍 Doze países votaram a favor do texto.
🌍 Um, os Estados Unidos, votou contra.
🌍 Dois se abstiveram. 

A embaixadora dos Estados Unidos na ONU argumentou que seu país ficou ""desapontado"" pelo fato de o texto não mencionar o direito de autodefesa de Israel. Como os EUA têm poder de veto, o texto não foi aprovado.

instagram,"The Iranian-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terror organization was responsible for an explosion at the Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, due to a misfired rocket intended to kill Israeli civilians, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) @idf . 

The explosion, which reportedly killed hundreds of people, sparked outrage, with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas pulling out of a meeting Wednesday with U.S. President Joe Biden over the issue. Biden has backed Israel’s war of self-defense against the Hamas terror group, which rules Gaza and which killed over 1,400 Israelis in a massive terror attack on October 7.

Hamas and critics of Israel rushed to blame an Israeli airstrike. News wires, like the Getty photo service, published unproven claims Israel had “attack[ed]” the hospital, citing the “Gaza Health Ministry,” which is run by Hamas.

instagram,"Rais wa Marekani, Joe Biden amedai amechukizwa na mashambulizi dhidi ya Hospitali moja katika Ukanda wa Gaza, ambayo yameuwa zaidi ya Watu 500 na kusababisha ukosoaji mkali kutoka Mataifa na Mashirika mbalimbali.

Mtandao wa @DW_Kiswahili umeripoti kuwa Biden ameyasema hayo mara tu baada ya kuwasili nchini Israel na kukutana na Mwenyeji wake, Waziri Mkuu Benjamin Netanyahu, leo Jumatano October 18,2023.

Rais huyo wa Marekani amelituhumu kundi la Wanamgambo wa Kipalestina la Hamas kuwa limehusika kufanya shambulizi hilo la Hospitali

Biden amesema Nchi yake itaipa Israel kila kitu inachohitaji kujilinda yenyewe wakati ikiendeleza vita vyake dhidi ya Hamas.

Israel inadai shambulizi hilo limesababishwa na roketi ya Palestina lakini Hamas inakanusha madai hayo.

Biden amedai kundi la Hamas ni baya zaidi kuliko kundi linalojiita Dola la Kiislamu kwa kitendo chao cha kuwaua Raia wa Israel katika shambulizi la October 07.

Mtandao wa @DW_Kiswahili umeripoti kuwa Wizara ya Afya ya Hamas imedai shambulizi la angani la Israel lililofanywa usiku wa kuamkia leo ndilo limesababisha maafa hayo lakini Jeshi la Israel limekana kuhusika na kusema roketi ya Wanamgambo wa Kiislamu huko Gaza ndiyo imepiga Hospitali.

Kwa mujibu wa Israel, Intelijensia ya Jeshi lake imebaini kuwa roketi iliyofyatuliwa vibaya na Wanamgambo wa Gaza ndiyo imeshambulia Hospitali ya Ahli Arab.

Haya yanajiri wakati Rais wa Marekani Joe Biden akitarajiwa kuitembelea Israel leo Jumatano, siku moja baada ya ziara ya Kansela wa Ujerumani Olaf Scholz mjini Tel Aviv.

Mkuu wa WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, amelaani shambulizi hilo na kutaka ulinzi wa haraka kwa raia na vituo vya afya katika eneo hilo la Palestina, Umoja wa Ulaya, Saudi Arabia, Jordan na Qatar ni miongoni mwa Nchi ambazo zimelaani shambulizi hilo zikisema zinakiuka sheria ya Kimataifa.

instagram,"Die Bilder und Videos des Tages sind entsetzlich und lassen mich um Fassung ringen. Bombenalarm in Israel, Krankenhausbeschuss in Gaza, antisemitische Angriffe in Berlin. Eskalierende Gewalt, die sich gegen unschuldige Menschen, Familien, Nachbarn, Freunde richtet. In Berlin meldet die jüdische Gemeinde einen versuchten Brandanschlag auf ein Gemeindehaus, das auch eine Kindertagesstätte beherbergt. Die Angst bei den jüdischen Bürgerinnen und Bürgern ist groß. Am Brandenburger Tor werden Polizisten angegriffen bei einer sogenannten Pro-Palästina-Demonstration. Doch sind diese feigen Angriffe so gar nicht im Sinne der Palästinenserinnen und Palästinenser, die in Gaza von der Hamas als menschliche Schutzschilder missbraucht werden.
 
Demgegenüber weiß ich: Die ganz große Mehrheit der Muslime in Deutschland blickt mit der gleichen Abscheu auf die Massaker der Hamas. Umso klarer ist: wer den Terror der Hamas in Deutschland öffentlich feiert und Antisemitismus verbreitet, der wird schnelle Konsequenzen spüren. Da gibt es kein Zögern.
 
Israel hat das im Völkerrecht festgehaltene Recht, sich zu wehren und die Pflicht, seine Bevölkerung zu schützen. Gleichzeitig darf eine Eskalation im Nahen Osten nicht zu einem Flächenbrand führen, zum Leidwesen aller dort lebenden Menschen. Der unbedingte und völkerrechtlich ebenso verankerte Schutz der Zivilbevölkerung ist Auftrag an alle Beteiligten und an die Weltgemeinschaft.
 
Zurück in Deutschland: Wir werden den Schutz jüdischer Einrichtungen verstärken. Auch jeder Einzelne von uns ist aufgefordert aufzustehen gegen Bedrohung und Gewalt gegen unsere Mitmenschen. Unsere jüdischen Freunde und Nachbarn müssen sich in ihrer Heimat Deutschland sicher fühlen können. Keinen Fußbreit dem Antisemitismus auf unseren Straßen. Lasst uns hier alle so laut werden, wie es nur geht.

instagram,"Israel wird nach eigenen Angaben humanitäre Hilfslieferungen aus Ägypten in den Gazastreifen zulassen. Dies gab am Mittwoch das Büro von Premierminister Netanyahu unter Verweis auf eine Bitte von US-Präsident Biden bekannt. Dabei dürfe es sich jedoch nur um Lebensmittel, Wasser und Medikamente für die Zivilist:innen im Süden des Küstenstreifens handeln. Israel werde dagegen nicht zulassen, dass humanitäre Hilfe von seinem Staatsgebiet aus in den Gazastreifen gelange, solange die von der Hamas verschleppten Israelis nicht wieder frei seien. 

Im Gazastreifen ist bei der jüngsten Eskalation nach Angaben des Auswärtigen Amts bislang eine einstellige Zahl deutscher Staatsbürger:innen ums Leben gekommen. Ein Ministeriumssprecher sagte in Berlin, insgesamt befinde sich eine „niedrige dreistellige Zahl“ deutscher Staatsbürger in dem palästinensischen Gebiet. 

In zahlreichen muslimischen Ländern demonstrierten Tausende Menschen gegen Israel. Nach ersten Protesten am Dienstagabend gingen heute unter anderem im Libanon, im Jemen, in Jordanien, Tunesien, Syrien, dem Iran und im Westjordanland zahlreiche Menschen auf die Straße und machten Israel für den Raketeneinschlag verantwortlich. Israel dagegen spricht von einer fehlgeleiteten Rakete der Palästinensermiliz Islamischer Dschihad. Im von Israel besetzten Westjordanland gingen Hunderte Palästinenser:innen auf die Straße. Bei Demonstrationen in Nablus und Ramallah wurden neben palästinensischen Flaggen auch Fahnen der Hamas geschwenkt, die den Gazastreifen kontrolliert. 

Die vom Iran unterstützte Hisbollah-Miliz im Libanon rief für Mittwoch einen „Tag der Wut“ aus. Auch in der libanesischen Hauptstadt Beirut demonstrierten Hunderte Menschen vor der US-Botschaft und skandierten „Tod für Amerika“ und „Tod für Israel“. Es kam zu gewaltsamen Auseinandersetzungen mit den Sicherheitskräften.

instagram,"Jumlah korban jiwa akibat serangan terhadap RS Al Ahli Arab di Kota Gaza pada Selasa (17/10), masih simpang siur.

Kementerian Kesehatan Gaza merevisi angka korban tewas dari 500 menjadi 471 pada Rabu (18/10), sementara petugas RS memperkirakan ratusan.

Seorang kepala pertahanan sipil di Gaza menyebut angka 300.

Pejabat Hamas menyebut serangan tersebut berasal dari Israel. Namun, militer Israel menolak tuduhan itu dengan merilis video, audio, dan informasi yang mengklaim bahwa roket itu milik kelompok Jihad Islam Palestina, militan Gaza lainnya, yang gagal meluncur di udara.

Kelompok Jihad Islam Palestina membantah klaim Israel itu.

Sejumlah warga Palestina percaya serangan itu berasal dari Israel.

""(Rumah sakit) ini jadi tempat berlindung para perempuan dan anak-anak, yang melarikan diri dari pengeboman Israel,” kata dokter RS Al Ahli Arab, Ibrahim Al-Naqa, kepada Reuters.

Naqa menyebut 3.000 orang sedang mengungsi di RS itu saat serangan terjadi, sementara dokter lainnya, Fadel Naim, berujar ada 1.000 orang di RS itu pada pagi harinya.

VOA, kantor berita Reuters, Associated Press, dan Agence France-Presse belum dapat memverifikasi secara independen siapa pelaku serangan tersebut.

Sementara itu, Gereja Anglikan, yang mengelola RS Al Ahli Arab, meminta semua pihak untuk setop saling menuduh hingga faktanya jelas.

""Kekejaman ini melanggar kesucian dan martabat hidup manusia. Ini pelanggaran hukum humaniter, yang jelas-jelas menyebut bahwa rumah sakit, dokter, dan pasien harus dilindungi, kata Uskup Canterbury, Justin Welby, dalam pernyataannya.

Os Estados Unidos (EUA), que têm direito a veto, não concordaram com a proposta do Brasil.

O texto teve 12 votos de apoio e duas abstenções — da Rússia e do Reino Unido. Mas o poder de veto dos EUA, um dos cinco membros permanentes do conselho, foi suficiente para derrubar a proposta. A favor da resolução votaram, além do Brasil, os seguintes países: França, Malta, Japão, Gana, Gabão, Suíça, Moçambique, Equador, China, Albânia, e Emirados Árabes.

Un drame de plus. Et des centaines de morts qui viennent s’ajouter aux milliers de personnes déjà décédées, en Israël et dans la bande de Gaza, depuis l’attaque du Hamas le 7 octobre dernier. Une explosion a touché l'hôpital Al-Ahli au centre de Gaza, mardi soir, faisant de nombreuses victimes. Israéliens et Palestiniens se rejettent la responsabilité.

instagram,"Presiden Mesir Abdel Fattah El-Sisi menyebut pihaknya tak menutup jalur bantuan di Rafah, perbatasan Mesir-Gaza. Ia menyalahkan pengeboman Israel yang sebabkan terhalangnya masuknya bantuan ke sana.⁣
⁣
""Perkembangan di lapangan dan pengeboman terus menerus oleh Israel di perbatasan sisi Palestina, telah menghalangi penyaluran bantuan,"" kata Sisi kepada wartawan, Rabu (18/10).⁣
⁣
Sisi menyinggung bahayanya 'pemindahan paksa warga Palestina dari Gaza ke Mesir' yang dapat mengulangi 'pemindahan warga Palestina dari Tepi Barat ke Yordania'.⁣
⁣
Dengan begitu, tujuan mendirikan negara Palestina akan 'kandas', katanya.⁣
⁣
Truk-truk yang mengangkut ratusan ton bantuan untuk Gaza juga dilaporkan masih mandek di Rafah, perbatasan Mesir-Gaza, hingga Rabu (18/10) pagi.⁣
⁣
Sementara itu, Kanselir Jerman Olaf Scholz yakin bantuan dapat segera masuk Gaza setelah diskusinya dengan pemimpin Israel, Yordania, dan Mesir.⁣
⁣
Gaza mulai menghadapi keterbatasan pangan, air, listrik, dan bahan bakar setelah pengepungan oleh Israel sejak perang dimulai.⁣
⁣
Palestina mencatat setidaknya 3.200 warganya tewas di Gaza, sementara Israel menyebut setidaknya 1.400 warganya tewas dan sekitar 200 lainnya disandera dalam serangan Hamas pada 7 Oktober.⁣

instagram,"“The massacre brought our health system to its knees.”

A doctor at Gaza’s al-Ahli Arab hospital has described the “surreal” and “horrifying” scenes he witnessed in the aftermath of an Israeli air strike that killed at least 471 Palestinians there last night.

“The brutality and the nature of the injuries we saw were something we had never witnessed in any attack on Gaza before,” Mohammed Gniem told Middle East Eye, after an Israeli bomb ripped through the hospital, leaving the bodies of the dead and wounded in its wake.

The massacre marks the single greatest loss of life in the ongoing conflict, which has seen at least 3,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza and the West Bank, and 1,400 people killed in Israel. Israeli siege and air strikes on Gaza have continued since 7 October, following a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel.

Thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the courtyards of al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, assuming that they were in a safe place. Many of those are now dead or seriously wounded.

One eyewitness, who did not wish to be named, told MEE that Israel “threatened to bomb the hospital during the first days of the attack, but we never thought they would actually do it”.

Gniem said that the massacre had shattered Gaza’s health system.

“Before the massacre, our hospital was already on the brink. Rooms were filled with those healing from previous massacres, and every corridor was filled with displaced people who sought a safe place to stay,” the doctor said.

“Try picturing a hospital already at capacity,” Gniem said. “Then add an influx of 500 of the injured and deceased,” he told MEE.

The doctor said that he had seen the bellies of children ripped open, “their remains were coming out of their bodies. All these injuries came while the staff were exhausted and the hospital was full.

“In a facility already stretched thin, our staff had to make do, treating those injured wherever space permitted, on the bare ground, with whatever scant supplies we had left,” Gniem said.

instagram,"ATAQUE A HOSPITAL EM GAZA

O presidente dos EUA Joe Biden afirmou, durante entrevista a jornalistas nesta quarta-feira (18), que é ""improvável"" que o míssil que atingiu o hospital na Faixa de Gaza seja de Israel.

Centenas de pessoas morreram no ataque, segundo o Ministério da Saúde da Palestina.

""Não estou insinuando que o Hamas tenha atacado de forma deliberada o hospital. Não seria a primeira vez que um lançamento do Hamas atinge o alvo errado”, completou.

instagram,"O presidente da Empresa Brasil de Comunicação (EBC), Hélio Doyle, compartilhou no seu perfil no X (antigo Twitter) uma postagem que diz que apoiadores de Israel são “idiotas”. No último dia 7, o grupo terrorista Hamas atacou o território israelense, matando pelo menos 1.400 pessoas no país. Esse é um dos confrontos mais sérios dos últimos anos, após semanas de tensões crescentes na Faixa de Gaza.

Nomeado pelo presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) para presidir o órgão em fevereiro, Doyle disse ao Estadão que o compartilhamento se refere aos “ataques indiscriminados contra a população de Gaza”.

A mensagem compartilhada por Doyle é de autoria do cartunista e ativista político Carlos Latuff, postada às 21h22 desta terça-feira, 17, na rede social. Latuff afirmou: “Não precisa ser sionista para apoiar Israel. Ser um idiota é o bastante”.

Hélio é jornalista e foi professor da Universidade de Brasília (UnB) por 28 anos. À frente da EBC desde 14 de fevereiro, tem salário bruto de R$ 34.895,78.

Ao Estadão, Doyle afirmou que defende a existência de Israel e de um Estado Palestino e a coexistência pacífica dos dois povos. Segundo o presidente da EBC, o compartilhamento da postagem representa um repúdio aos danos causados pela contraofensiva israelense.

Und zwar schnell.

Nicht allen ist sofort klar, was passiert ist. Ein verdächtiger Gegenstand an Bord vielleicht? Es klärt sich aber schnell: Raketenalarm. Schon wieder. Etwa zwei Stunden vorher musste Scholz sich schon in der deutschen Botschaft in Tel Aviv zwei Mal in einem Schutzraum verschanzen. Diesmal geht es raus in die Dunkelheit auf das Flugfeld.

Scholz wird mit einem Fahrzeug zu einem Flughafengebäude gebracht. Ein Teil seiner Delegation läuft hinterher. Einige Mitarbeiter*innen, die Journalist*innen und die Crew gehen auf dem Flugfeld in Deckung, legen sich flach auf den Boden. Neben den Wagen der Kanzler-Kolonne, die da noch stehen.

Zwei Mal donnert es laut. Es sind Abwehrraketen des ""Iron Dome"", des Raketenschutzschilds, das die israelische Küstenmetropole Tel Aviv vor den aus dem Gazastreifen kommenden Raketen der islamistischen Hamas schützen soll.

Nach wenigen Minuten gibt es Entwarnung. Die Erleichterung bei den Beteiligten ist spürbar.

Como os EUA são um membro permanente do conselho e, portanto, têm poder de veto, o texto foi rejeitado. Após a votação, a embaixadora dos Estados Unidos na ONU, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, argumentou que seu país ficou “desapontado” pelo fato de o texto não mencionar o direito de autodefesa de Israel.
A rejeição dos EUA também veio depois de a Rússia propor mudanças para o texto. 

O embaixador russo na ONU exigiu a inclusão de um pedido de cessar-fogo imediato, o que Washington é contra.

instagram,"É sobre petróleo a viagem do presidente americano Joe Biden a Israel. Ou melhor: era, até que um míssil de origem incerta matou mais de 500 palestinos abrigados no maior hospital de Gaza – uns doentes e feridos, outros em busca de proteção.

Se hospital não é lugar a salvo de bombas durante uma guerra, escola também não é, igrejas e mesquitas tampouco, onde os civis de Gaza, sob intenso fogo de Israel há mais de 10 dias, poderão sentir-se relativamente seguros? Pelo jeito, em lugar algum.

O Ministério da Saúde de Gaza disse que o míssil foi lançado pelas Forças de Defesa de Israel. O governo de Israel negou: o míssil teria sido lançado pela Jihad Islâmica, grupo radical que apoia o Hamas. A Jihad negou. Por que, diabos, atacaria um aliado?

Para Daniel C. Kurtzer, ex-embaixador dos Estados Unidos em Israel que agora leciona na Universidade de Princeton, a explosão em Gaza colocou Biden numa posição desconfortável: “Biden está caminhando para uma situação ainda mais catastrófica do que esperava. Palestinos e árabes não vão acreditar que a tragédia do hospital não é obra de Israel, e a percepção torna-se realidade.”

Kurtzer aposta que a conversa entre Biden e o primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, agora se tornará mais desafiadora: “A mensagem de Biden tem que ser muito simples: ‘Na semana passada vocês estavam no foco, agora vocês são o foco negativo’”.

instagram,"Joe Biden opened his visit to Israel on Wednesday vowing to show the world the U.S. stands alongside the Jewish people in their fight against Hamas terrorists while assessing the deadly explosion at a Gaza Strip hospital as appearing to have been carried out “by the other team” and not the Israeli military.

He added the Hamas terror group had only brought suffering to those living in Gaza, the West Bank and beyond.

AP reports the president said, “Based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,” during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, referring to Hamas terrorists.

Biden conceded there were “a lot of people out there” who weren’t sure what caused the blast.

As Breitbart News reported, the Iranian-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terror organization was responsible for an explosion at the Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, due to a misfired rocket intended to kill Israeli civilians, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The deadly blast, which reportedly killed hundreds of people, sparked outrage, with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas dropping a meeting Wednesday with Biden over the issue.

instagram,"Die Gewaltspirale darf sich nicht weiterdrehen! Die brutalen Terroranschläge und Geiselnahmen der Hamas sind furchtbar. Natürlich hat Israel das Recht, sich und seine Bürger zu verteidigen. Dies rechtfertigt jedoch keine militärischen Angriffe, bei denen das Völkerrecht missachtet und der Schutz der Zivilbevölkerung nicht gewährleistet wird. Die Bundesregierung muss sich jetzt mit Nachdruck der Forderung des UN-Generalsekretärs nach einer humanitären Feuerpause im Nahost-Konflikt anschließen, damit Hilfsorganisationen lebenswichtige Hilfe, insbesondere für Mütter und Kinder, für verletzte, kranke und alte Menschen leisten können. Eine solche Feuerpause ist auch nötig, um durch unabhängige Institutionen zu klären, wer für den Beschuss eines Krankenhauses in Gaza verantwortlich ist. Dieser Angriff, bei dem womöglich hunderte Menschen getötet oder verletzt wurden, ist furchtbar und nicht zu rechtfertigen. Die Abriegelung des Gazastreifens muss aufgehoben und den Vereinten Nationen Zugang gewährt werden, um dringende humanitäre Hilfe für palästinensische Zivilisten zu leisten.

instagram,"A Embaixada de Israel em Brasília repudiou, nesta terça-feira, 17, a nota do Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a respeito dos ataques terroristas do Hamas. 

Como representante de Israel no país, a embaixada reagiu com indignação à resolução divulgada no dia anterior, em que o partido se negou a definir o Hamas como terrorista e equiparou as ações do grupo às de Israel.

""Qualquer pessoa que pense que o assassinato bárbaro, a violação e a decapitação de pessoas é uma posição política, ou que se trata apenas de uma luta política legítima, possui uma extrema falta de compreensão da atual situação"", afirmou a embaixada, em nota oficial.

Ainda de acordo com a embaixada, ""é muito lamentável que um partido que defende os direitos humanos compare a organização terrorista Hamas, que vai de casa em casa para assassinar famílias inteiras, com o que o governo israelense está fazendo para proteger os seus cidadãos"". ""Deve ser feita uma forte separação entre a organização terrorista Hamas e os palestinos"", acrescentou.

instagram,"Reparem na ""evolução"" das manchetes:

1ª Manchete: ""Ataque israelense mata centenas em hospital, dizem palestinos (Hamas)""

2ª Manchete: ""Pelo menos 500 mortos em um ataque em hospital de Gaza, dizem palestinos (Hamas)""

3ª Manchete: ""Pelo menos 500 mortos em explosão em hospital de Gaza, dizem palestinos (Hamas)""

Na 1ª manchete, as mídias se limitaram a repetir o que os terroristas do Hamas diziam, ou seja, que um ataque israelense contra um hospital em Gaza tinha matado centenas de pessoas.

Na 2ª manchete tiraram o ""ataque israelense"", mas mantiveram o termo ""ataque"" e, finalmente, na 3ª manchete, substituíram o ""ataque"" por ""explosão"".

Hoje, com vídeos e fotos tirados diretamente no local, sabemos que o ""ataque"" foi um incêndio no estacionamento do hospital causado pela queda de um foguete que queimou alguns carros e estilhaçou alguns vidros. Não há crateras, não há danos estruturais. Um ""ataque"" incapaz de gerar as mais de 500 vítimas mortais que o Hamas alega.

Pela análise dos vídeos e fotos do local (ver posts anteriores), fica evidente que o estacionamento do hospital foi atingido por um foguete defeituoso lançado pelos terroristas da Jihad Islâmica, um outro grupo terrorista que atua na Faixa de Gaza ao lado do Hamas.",,11011,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 1011, 'num_users': 765466}",Hoje no Mundo Militar,,2023-10-18 10:06:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/183976965_513238699805095_6643053726191865900_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=72mzLdBsNpAAX8f5BSk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAsj8hbq7aX89wEFGdqq8mdhjih6_lu6V3PNseF_NutVw&oe=655A1ECB,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyiUPc_s-oh/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392937069_694517798971120_6783117387422647191_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=fvwqtJ0XL2UAX-8lLFq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAYhmNJ9BTYzgtkOgjDAsNwUD-VfU8QX71kpksMpAFDUw&oe=6536FAD8

Un segnale inequivocabile da parte del popolo delle Vele di solidarietà e vicinanza alla popolazione di Gaza massacrata in queste ore dalla inaudita furia omicida del governo israeliano nel silenzio colpevole del mondo occidentale. 
""Sappiamo bene che la storia di questo conflitto ha radici ben più lontane degli eventi degli ultimi 10 giorni, dichiarano gli attivisti firmatari dell'azione mentre si preparano ad una nuova manifestazione per venerdì 20 ottobre alle 16.00 a piazza Garibaldi - poiché già nel Maggio del 2021, durante l’ennesimo attacco indiscrimato e immotivato sui civili palestinesi, un lungo striscione bianco fu calato dalla stessa vela dal comitato degli abitanti, 
questo perché sono anni che Israele porta avanti violenze e massacri ai danni della popolazione civile palestinese e oggi, dopo gli attacchi di Hamas, ha deciso di mettere in campo un definitivovgenocidio, un massacro che non ha precedenti nella storia recente.""

instagram,"The state of Israel’s official Instagram account has hit out at Gigi Hadid, after the American model shared a statement about the ongoing Israel-Palestine war.

Hadid, whose Palestinian father and his family were forced from their home during the Nakba, posted an infographic on her Instagram account that read: “There is nothing Jewish about the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians. Condemning the Israeli government is not antisemitic and supporting Palestinians is not supporting Hamas.”

Israel’s account responded with a repurposed version of the infographic and a message that read: “Have you been sleeping the past week Gigi? Or are you just fine turning a blind eye to Jewish babies being butchered in their homes? Your silence has been very clear about where you stand. We see you.”

The text in the photo posted by Israel’s account read: “There is nothing valiant about Hamas’ massacre of Israelis. Condemning Hamas for what it is (ISIS) is not anti-Palestine and supporting Israelis in their fight against barbaric terrorists is the right thing to do.”

In a follow-up post, the State of Israel account shared an image of what appeared to be blood on the floor next to children’s toys and clothing. Tagging Hadid, they added: “If you don’t condemn this your words mean nothing.”

Hadid, who is proud of her Palestinian heritage, is often a target for pro-Israel accounts. Last week, on 10 October, she shared a statement about the war in which she said: “While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person.”",,10857,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 857, 'num_users': 1157344}",Middle East Eye,,2023-10-18 07:23:02,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15258686_1293569957329919_8094586152507408384_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CJDb2hU5us0AX_v4NHq&_nc_oc=AQmhTNx9JSMKJ7ByPW-gAGlyTUGiK1GB9OxZLYVv7ZLpS0ddjuukWkjI1QowiM0WwAw&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDM7VWUIVa31bFMO0RjUyWcPwhVRpDGdNt6sYzg3bsFBw&oe=655A8754,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyiBkMsgYPK/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392774462_268573352844893_1481958211227527368_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=mmEZjkm0XysAX8SW_xj&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDYFx2lINl_L2SbRkA6oBMjZkzNmR5T0sGoDI6_3ijHZw&oe=6536D7B2

ارتش اسرائیل می‌گوید که مکالمه اعضای گروه‌های شبه‌نظامی در مورد انفجار شب گذشته بیمارستان الاهلی العربی نشان می‌دهد که این رویداد نتیجه انحراف موشک‌های پرتاب‌شده توسط خودشان بوده است.
در نسخه‌ای از این مکالمه که در کنفرانس خبری دانیل هاگاری به رسانه‌ها داده شد، دو نفر مکالمه‌ای به زبان عربی در مورد این رویداد انجام می‌دهند.
سخنگوی ارتش اسرائیل گفت که هیچ حمله‌ای از سوی ارتش اسرائیل از طریق زمین، دریا یا هوا به بیمارستان انجام نشده است و سیستم‌های راداری آن‌ها موشک‌هایی را که در زمان انفجار از غزه شلیک می‌شدند را ردیابی می‌کردند.
او گفت که ویدئوها و اسناد آن‌ها از جمله همین فایل صوتی نشان می‌دهد که پرتاب ناموفق موشکی از قبرستانی در پشت بیمارستان رخ داده است و ارتش اسرائیل ارتباط «بین تروریست‌هایی که درباره شلیک موشک‌ها صحبت می‌کنند» را رهگیری کرده است.
او صوتی را پخش کرد که به گفته خودش اثبات‌کننده ادعاهایش است.
سخنگوی ارتش اسرائیل همچنین گفت که در طول درگیری‌ها، تقریباً ۴۵۰ راکت به سمت اسرائیل شلیک شده و در غزه فرود آمده است.
او می‌گوید: «ما هر حادثه‌ای که غیرنظامیان را درگیر کند، بسیار بسیار جدی می‌گیریم.»
هاگاری در پاسخ به سؤال خبرنگاری که چرا جهان باید به اسرائیل اعتماد کند، گفت که بررسی حقایق و ارجاع اطلاعات آن پنج ساعت طول کشید.
در این کنفرانس خبری از او خواسته شد که به ادعای فرستاده فلسطین در ژاپن مبنی بر اینکه اسرائیل قبل از انفجار دیشب با بیمارستان تماس گرفته و هشدار حمله هوایی داده بود، پاسخ دهد. هاگاری گفت که «پاسخ این سوال را نمی‌داند» اما بررسی خواهد کرد.

After overseeing the passage of a law banning pro-Palestine demonstrations, French President Emmanuel Macron has now vowed to immediately deport all foreign born migrants deemed to have sympathies with Islamic extremism.

Macron made the announcement after a middle school teacher in the city of Arras was murdered by a suspected Islamist who was already on the French extremist watch list.

Macron has order the Minister of the Interior Gérald Darmanin to begin a “ruthless” examination of the files of migrants who “carry hatred and terrorist ideologies” and immediately revoke their visas and kick them out of the country.

Macron’s decision came ahead of a mass shooting in neighbouring country Belgium Monday, which saw an illegal jihadist go on a rampage in Brussels:

instagram,"Política internacional – O presidente dos Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, desembarcou em Israel durante a manhã desta quarta-feira (18). Durante a visita ao país, Biden se reunirá com militares e com o primeiro-ministro Benjamin Netanyahu para discutir o conflito no Oriente Médio.

Desde o dia 7 de outubro, quando o Hamas lançou ataques contra Israel a partir da Faixa de Gaza, mais de 4 mil pessoas morreram e milhares ficaram feridas.

Segundo especialistas, a ida de Biden a Israel tem como objetivo demonstrar o apoio norte-americano a Israel e, ao mesmo tempo, tentar evitar que o conflito envolva outros países na região — como o Irã, o Líbano e a Síria.

💬 “Ele fará algumas perguntas difíceis, como um amigo, como um verdadeiro amigo de Israel, mas fará algumas perguntas a eles”, disse o porta-voz John Kirby.

De stemming over de resolutie, opgesteld door Brazilië, was de afgelopen dagen al 2 keer uitgesteld, omdat de VS probeerde toegang te regelen voor hulpverleners tot de miljoen vluchtelingen in Gaza. Dat is nog steeds niet gelukt.

In de tekst van de resolutie werd al het geweld veroordeeld en opgeroepen tot de onvoorwaardelijke vrijlating van alle gijzelaars. Hamas heeft eerder gezegd dat de gijzelaars pas vrijkomen als Israël zijn aanvallen op Gaza staakt.

""O Brasil costurou uma boa resolução, atendendo a praticamente todos os lados, e os Estados Unidos usaram como justificativa para votar contra o fato de não ter nenhum ponto dizendo que Israel tem o direito de reagir. Eles não querem que Israel pare de atacar o Hamas. É isso que está acontecendo"", disse Valdo.

""Doze países votaram a favor da resolução, e os EUA resolveram assumir esse custo político mundial. Agora, serão responsabilizados se esse conflito ganhar uma nova dimensão"".

Un alto cargo de esa organización señaló al canal que los rehenes podrían ser liberados en cuestión de una hora siempre y cuando Israel se ajuste a sus demandas, y subrayó que en estos momentos no hay un lugar seguro para ponerlos en libertad.
.
A cambio de liberar a los soldados israelíes retenidos, añadió, Israel debe liberar a todos los palestinos que están en cárceles israelíes. El oficial de Hamas afirmó que tanto Estados Unidos como Israel están ya al tanto de las condiciones de cara a la eventual liberación de los civiles rehenes, alegando que el grupo las ha dado a conocer en sus conversaciones con líderes de varios países árabes.
.
Su anuncio tiene lugar el mismo día en que un bombardeo sobre un hospital de la ciudad de Gaza causó al menos 500 muertos, según confirmó a EFE una portavoz del Ministerio de Sanidad de la Franja, controlada por Hamás.

instagram,"In Gaza-stad zijn gisterenavond honderden doden gevallen bij een luchtaanval op het Al Ahli Arab-ziekenhuis. Duizenden Palestijnen schuilden er voor Israëlische bombardementen. Er is nog veel onduidelijkheid over wie achter de aanval zit. Hamas spreekt van ""een nieuwe oorlogsmisdaad door Israël"". Israël ontkent dat en zegt dat de extremistische Palestijnse beweging Islamitische Jihad verantwoordelijk is. Die zegt dan weer dat dat leugens zijn. 

Er vielen gisteren ook zeker zes doden na een aanval op een school die beheerd wordt door een VN-organisatie. ""Geen plek is meer veilig in Gaza, zelfs VN-gebouwen niet"", klinkt het bij de organisatie. Er is wereldwijd grote verontwaardiging over de aanvallen.

instagram,"Global wrath is palpable in response to the hospital bombing in Gaza, estimated to be the single deadliest attack since the Israeli-Hamas war began on October 7. 

After at least 500 people were killed in an Israeli air raid on a hospital in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities in the besieged territory, the world seems to have erupted in anger.

The attack happened at al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday.

Pro-Palestine protests broke out in cities across West Asia. Thousands of protesters took to the streets across the Middle East and North Africa on Tuesday to show their outrage in the aftermath of the deadly attack in Gaza.

Spontaneous protests have erupted in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and Iraq, as well as in West Bank cities like Ramallah.

World leaders have also condemned the Gaza hospital bombing, believed to be one of the deadliest single incidents in Gaza since the war broke out. 

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the attack and stressed the importance of adhering to the laws of war. “The news coming out of Gaza is horrific and absolutely unacceptable … international law needs to be respected in this and in all cases. There are rules around wars and it’s not acceptable to hit a hospital,” Trudeau told reporters.",,10557,"{'like_count': 10000, 'comment_count': 557, 'num_users': 783490}",Indiatimes,,2023-10-18 09:46:42,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/370572795_289657980337985_3572264800135278624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=L3zIpLG0fIYAX9vxNfY&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAFMA5_YaL8ry2cr4nUwUFbJ7y6wn8sLSjnNDA_oBUPiA&oe=655ADEE1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyiSAX5N2fx/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/393606263_659705732933690_7201514699397030419_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=OFLOIgs0-wQAX-PCPul&_nc_oc=AQkBHZs1mBON5YlC5cow-lCyIBVWUKtfm5WLNj6UYOxsvBWGZug57DpwTd7GxkJscaE&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAJrVLIh93-Pk8lotT4RZpW4nf4AQqDTMpDDu3Qz4toAA&oe=653850A3

500 people were killed after a hospital in central Gaza was hit by an airstrike last night. While the Israeli army pinned blame on a ""misfired rocket"" by Palestine's Islamic Jihad group, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says Israel was behind the bombing of the hospital.

instagram,"A HISTORY OF SILENCE: A Melbourne man says he’s learned from past mistakes as he opts to stay out of the social media discourse surrounding the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

In previous flare ups between Israel and Palestine, Naarm boy Wesley Talbot was quick to show his support for Palestine but that lead to conflict between his old Camberwell schoolmates who didn’t see it the way he did.

“Their parents called my parents, it was messy but that was a while ago and my old friends were happy to ‘educate’ me and move on,” he said.

“So despite there being, you know, clear violations of international law and abhorrent criminal acts committed upon… actually, I’m going to stop myself there. I didn’t even share anything about the referendum, to tell you the truth, I think I’m actually going to become one of those guys that doesn’t post anything – like ever,”

“Like, I still see my school friends heaps and while, like, they didn’t exactly forge the same path through Melbourne Uni that I did, like a lot of them are now dentists and doctors, some are lawyers and engineers. But, like, I did Arts with a major in criticism and Australian literature so, yeah, my university experience was a bit different,”

“So now, like, for example, I have a friend that grew up in a council flat in Fitzroy so there’s that and like I don’t exactly get back to Brighton that much now that I live in Northcote so yeah, I forget that sometimes a lot of my school friends are pretty conservative and like, I think a few of them are from like ‘their-dad-is-Jewish’ type setups or something. So yeah, like my school mates are pretty pro-Israel and my uni friends are like full on going to pro-Palestine protests,”

“So I’m just going to sit this one out, I’m not even on the fence here. I’m in a different postcode.”

instagram,"O papa Francisco fez um apelo nesta quarta-feira, 18 de outubro, aos líderes mundiais para que “façam todo o possível para evitar uma catástrofe humanitária em Gaza”, onde “a situação é desesperadora”, ao mesmo tempo que expressou preocupação com uma “possível ampliação do conflito”

“A possível ampliação do conflito é inquietante quando há tantas frentes de guerra abertas no mundo. Silenciem as armas, escutem o grito de paz dos pobres, das pessoas, das crianças”, afirmou o pontífice em sua audiência geral semanal no Vaticano

O papa não mencionou a explosão da última terça-feira, 17 de outubro, em um hospital de Gaza, que provocou centenas de mortes e uma troca de acusações entre Israel e as milícias palestinas

O texto foi rejeitado por 1 voto, o dos EUA, que são um dos cinco membros permanentes do Conselho de Segurança da ONU e, portanto, têm poder de veto.

A resolução brasileira condenava os ataques terroristas do Hamas contra Israel e pedia um cessar-fogo imediato. No entanto, os EUA ficaram “desapontados” pelo fato de o texto não mencionar o direito de autodefesa de Israel.

A Rússia, por sua vez, também propôs mudanças para o texto, exigindo a inclusão de um pedido de cessar-fogo imediato. No entanto, os EUA também se opuseram a essa mudança.

instagram,"Karim Benzema accusato di avere legami col terrorismo 😳🇫🇷

Il ministro degli Interni francese, Gérald Darmanin durante un'intervista televisiva ha velatamente accusato Karim Benzema di avere legami col terrorismo. Le accuse sono state rivolte al Pallone d'Oro francese  durante un'intervista del ministro a CNews. Darmanin, parlando degli attentati in Francia e Belgio seguiti al conflitto tra Israele e il gruppo terroristico palestinese Hamas, ha detto: ""Il signor Karim Benzema ha notori legami, come tutti sappiamo, con l'organizzazione dei Fratelli Musulmani"", un gruppo politico radicale ma non terroristico.

Dichiarazioni giunte dopo le critiche ricevute da Benzema per aver condiviso un messaggio di sostegno alle vittime palestinesi senza citare quelle israeliane. Duduu Aouate, ex portiere israeliano tra le altre del Racing e del Deportivo La Coruña, ha risposto in maniera netta via social: ""Sei un figlio di..."", ha detto. Per il momento non sono arrivate repliche da parte di Benzema, approdato questa stagione alla Saudi League.

instagram,"“No Dia das Crianças, o governo israelense confirmou que houve decapitação de bebês no ataque do Hamas. Aqui no Brasil, bebês que ainda não nasceram também são mortos. Segundo a OMS, há cerca de 1 milhão de abortos por ano no país. A então presidente do Supremo votou por não considerar crime matar quem ainda não tenha 12 semanas desde a concepção. Neste dia 12, também se comemora a Padroeira do Brasil, que, segundo o Novo Testamento, foi fecundada por Deus e protegeu seu ventre até o nascimento, em Belém. Segundo as escrituras, o rei Herodes, temeroso pelo nascimento desse futuro rei, mandou degolar todos os bebês da região, como o Hamas fez no Shabat. Quando vi as primeiras imagens do ataque do Hamas a Israel, com corpos de pessoas mortas na calçada, na parada de ônibus, pensei que fossem de um quiosque da Avenida Lúcio Costa, na Barra da Tijuca. Muito semelhantes às imagens que havia visto dos corpos dos médicos baleados no chão — um ainda na cadeira onde estava sentado enquanto vivia. Depois vi imagens do Hamas sobre camionetas, brandindo fuzis, e desconfiei que fossem imagens do Rio de Janeiro, em mais um bonde. Os fuzis são dos mesmos fabricantes, os mesmos modelos. Chegam ao Rio e à Faixa de Gaza com a mesma facilidade. Lá e cá, a morte chegou pelo mesmo motivo: ""foram mortos porque estavam ali"". No Rio, a bala perdida agora é acrescida de outra causa: ""foi por engano"".

instagram,"Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) should impose an oil embargo and other sanctions on Israel and expel all Israeli ambassadors, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Wednesday.

An urgent meeting of the OIC is taking place in the Saudi city of Jeddah to discuss the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict, after a blast at a Gaza hospital late on Tuesday killed large numbers of Palestinians.
""The foreign minister calls for an immediate and complete embargo on Israel by Islamic countries, including oil sanctions, in addition to expelling Israeli ambassadors if relations with the Zionist regime have been established,"" the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.

Amirabdollahian also called for the formation of a team of Islamic lawyers to document potential war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza.
Prior to the blast at the Gaza hospital on Tuesday, health authorities in Gaza said at least 3,000 people had died during Israel's 11-day bombardment that began after a Hamas Oct. 7 rampage on southern Israeli communities in which 1,300 people were killed and around 200 were taken into Gaza as hostages.

Israele 🇮🇱 e Hamas si puntano il dito su chi è il responsabile del missile che ieri ha colpito un ospedale 🏥 nella striscia di Gaza 🇵🇸 uccidendo almeno 500 persone tra cui donne e bambini.

Avere un parere oggettivo e senza vizi di parte dai media occidentali al momento è molto difficile… Ecco la nostra analisi che include tutte le accuse, ad entrambi gli stati, con un occhio distaccato e imparziale ➡️

Secondo noi, l’unico modo per cui si possa giungere ad una verità è che sulla questione indaghi un ente esterno neutrale e senza interessi economici in nessuno dei due schieramenti.
Non america. Non Israele. Non Hamas o gli stati alleati. 

🚨 DISCLAIMER: 
Ci teniamo a sottolineare che il nostro punto di vista sulla questione è neutrale e che il nostro unico ""appoggio"" va alle popolazioni civili (sia palestinesi che israeliane) che vengono tragicamente coinvolte nel conflitto.

Molti ci accusano persino di non poter portare determinati contenuti, senza sapere che parliamo di temi sociali e attualità da ormai 5 anni.
Quello che rispondiamo a questi utenti è che tutti i nostri post vengono pubblicati con tesi e prove volte a raccogliere tutti i giudizi oggettivi dell'accaduto senza cercare di dare per forza di cose ragione all'uno o all'altro schieramento (come fanno la maggior parte dei mass-media da cui vi informate).

I contenuti delle prossime slide vi daranno prova della serietà e dedizione con cui trattiamo anche determinate tematiche.
Non vogliamo raccogliere il consenso di nessuno: quando abbiamo riportato dell'attacco di Hamas contro Israele abbiamo subito gli insulti dei PRO-palestinesi... Quando ieri sera abbiamo riportato dell'attacco all'ospedale abbiamo invece ricevuto le critiche dei filo-israeliani.

Smettetela di trattare questo conflitto come fosse una partita di calcio e guardate in faccia la realtà. Migliaia di innocenti stanno morendo.

“Não podia ficar de braços cruzados quando há famílias a serem massacradas e queimadas vivas nas suas casas, apenas por serem judias ou israelitas”, acrescentando que não está lá apenas a defender Israel, mas fá-lo pela humanidade”.

instagram,"Au tour de Danièle Obono d’alimenter la polémique. Alors que de nombreuses voix se sont élevées, ces derniers jours, pour condamner le refus de Jean-Luc Mélenchon et de son cercle rapproché de qualifier le Hamas de « terroriste », à la suite de son attaque meurtrière contre Israël, la députée (La France insoumise, LFI) de Paris a tenu des propos, mardi 17 octobre, qui ont ravivé de vives critiques contre les « insoumis ».

Poussée à plusieurs reprises par le journaliste Jean-Jacques Bourdin, à l’antenne de Sud Radio, à dire si le Hamas, qui a conduit des massacres en Israël, le 7 octobre, est « un mouvement de résistance », cette membre de la direction de LFI a fini par répondre : « Oui. » « C’est un mouvement de résistance qui se définit comme tel », a-t-elle affirmé. Pour Danièle Obono, « c’est un groupe politique islamiste qui a une branche armée », qui « s’inscrit dans les formations politiques palestiniennes », qui « a pour objectif la libération de la Palestine » et qui « résiste à une occupation ».

« Le Hamas, “un mouvement de résistance” ? Non ! C’est un mouvement terroriste », a réagi le ministre de l’intérieur, Gérald Darmanin, sur X (ex-Twitter), deux heures plus tard. Avant d’annoncer qu’il saisissait le procureur de la République « pour apologie du terrorisme » à l’encontre de Danièle Obono. L’Elysée approuve l’initiative du ministre, l’exécutif se voulant « intraitable avec tout ce qui relativise les actes de violence ».

instagram,"Entrevista exclusiva de @cristyan_costa

“Decapitar crianças, assassinar idosos e estuprar mulheres inocentes, da forma como o Hamas fez é terrorismo, e não há outro nome”, constatou o embaixador de Israel no Brasil, Daniel Zonshine, ao dizer que vê com “estranheza” a postura da diplomacia de Lula em relação aos radicais. “Como país amigo, esperamos que o governo nos apoie neste momento difícil, condenando essas ações.” Desde o primeiro ataque do Hamas a Israel, em 7 de outubro, o Palácio do Planalto tem evitado classificar o Hamas como um grupo terrorista, apoiando-se até na ONU.

Zonshine relata ainda a dificuldade para desconstruir a imagem segundo a qual o Hamas é apenas um movimento em busca da libertação da Palestina. De acordo com o embaixador, o monumento ao cinismo levou tempo para ficar pronto. “Trata-se de uma grande mentira”, afirmou com voz imperiosa o diplomata, de 64 anos, formado em arqueologia e com mestrado em defesa, ao denunciar a existência de uma “campanha” que envolve pessoas a serviço dessa teoria falaciosa em universidades e centros de disseminação de informação ao redor do mundo. “É difícil desfazer isso.”

But it is safe to say that most Arabs still sympathise with the Palestinian cause. Their dispossession remains a totemic political issue across the region, able to mobilise popular anger and protest like little else.⁠
⁠
The war between Israel and Hamas, now in its 12th day, has been no different. Covered around the clock on television, discussed endlessly on social media, it has sparked an outpouring of support for Palestinians. ⁠

instagram,"Malah nuduh Hamas ? 🤔

Jakarta, CNN Indonesia -- Militer Israel membantah telah membombardir sebuah rumah sakit di Jalur Gaza Palestina hingga menewaskan lebih dari 500 orang pada Selasa (17/10).
Israel menuding gempuran ke RS Al-Ahli di Gaza itu disebabkan oleh sebuah roket milik kelompok militan Jihad Islam Palestina, sekutu Hamas, yang salah sasaran.

""Analisa menunjukkan bahwa rentetan roket ditembakkan oleh teroris di Gaza, dan melintas di dekat rumah sakit Ahli di Gaza pada saat serangan itu terjadi,"" kata militer Israel melalui pernyataan yang keluar dua jam setelah serangan mematikan tersebut.

""Informasi intelijen dari berbagai sumber yang kami miliki menunjukkan bahwa Jihad Islam bertanggung jawab atas kegagalan peluncuran roket yang akhirnya menghantam rumah sakit di Gaza,"" ucap militer Israel menambahkan seperti dikutip AFP.

Perdana Menteri Israel Benjamin Netanyahu bahkan mengatakan ""teroris biadab di Gaza lah yang menyerang rumah sakit di Gaza, bukan IDF (Pasukan Pertahanan Israel).""

Jihad Islam selama ini memang mengaku ikut berperang bersama Hamas untuk melawan Israel.

Sejumlah video yang tersebar di media sosial menunjukkan mayat-mayat berserakan di halaman rumah sakit tersebut.

Menurut seorang reporter Anadolu, ribuan warga Palestina berada di rumah sakit ketika gedung tersebut dibombardir militer Israel.

Serangan udara tersebut terjadi pada hari ke-11 dalam konflik antara Israel dengan Hamas. Israel juga berencana melancarkan serangan darat dengan tujuan membasmi Hamas.

Namun, belakangan semakin banyak kelompok non-pemerintah dan pemimpin dunia yang menyatakan bahwa blokade total dan bombardir Israel di Jalur Gaza melanggar hukum internasional dan mungkin merupakan kejahatan perang.

President Biden announced today the U.S. will provide $100 million in humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.

The administration says this funding will help provide clean water, food, medical care, and other critical aid to Palestinian civilians who have been displaced by the conflict.

Israel adds that this will be the only type of aid allowed in and will continue as long as the supplies do not reach Hamas.

The two leaders agreed that the aid will not enter through Israel’s border with Gaza but instead through the Rafah Crossing which connects to Egypt.

As of this post, Egypt has not agreed to open that crossing. We will continue to monitor development.

The White House said in a statement that “civilians are not to blame and should not suffer for Hamas’s horrific terrorism. Civilian lives must be protected and assistance must urgently reach those in need.”

The US is limited in the aid it can provide at this time because Congress can’t act without a Speaker.

De Palestijnse autoriteiten geven Israël de schuld, maar dat ontkent en zegt over inlichtingen te beschikken die wijzen op een gefaalde lancering van een raket van de paramilitaire beweging Palestijnse Islamitische Jihad. Maar ook die organisatie ontkent enige betrokkenheid bij de explosie.

Bij de aanvallen van Hamas zijn zeker 1.400 Israëli’s gedood, duizenden mensen zijn gewond geraakt. Minstens 155 mensen zijn als gijzelaars mee naar Gaza genomen, stelt het Israëlische leger zondagavond. Aan Palestijnse kant zijn al minstens 3.000 mensen gedood door Israëlische bombardementen en duizenden gewonden gevallen.

As previously reported, a blast at a hospital in Gaza City killed 500 innocent Palestinians on Tuesday.  It was the deadliest single incident from the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militants. 
__________________________________________________
The health ministry in Gaza said the blast at the hospital was caused by a retaliatory Israeli air raid following the Hamas’ surprise weekend attack on Oct. 7. However, Israel’s military denied responsibility for the bombing, saying military intelligence suggested the hospital was hit by a failed rocket launch by the enclave’s Palestinian Islamic Jihad military group.
__________________________________________________
Earlier this Wednesday morning, US President Joe Biden arrived in Israel pledging solidarity in its war against Hamas. While there, he also said Israel was not to blame for the rocket attack on a hospital in Gaza, which left at hundreds of people dead. He said, “I was outraged by the bombing of the hospital yesterday. Based on what I’ve seen, it was done by the other team. Not you,” Biden said at a brief press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu... “But there’s a lot of people out there who are not sure.”

A nota do PT atribuindo um “genocídio” a Israel é uma indecência. Nela, a condenação às atrocidades cometidas pelo Hamas contra israelenses — atrocidades que foram a causa do atual conflito — é aspecto lateral, rápido, destinado apenas a dar aparência de que o partido tem visão equilibrada sobre o que está ocorrendo no Oriente Médio.

O PT iguala os atos terroristas perpetrados por uma organização islâmica criada para destruir Israel a atos de guerra de um estado nacional que busca defender-se do agressor.

Para o PT, o Hamas não é terrorista (palavra que inexiste na nota). Para o PT, é como se o Hamas não usasse civis como escudos humanos. Não queimasse e degolasse bebês israelenses e não utilizasse bebês palestinos como proteção contra bombardeios. Para o PT, Israel sequestrou civis (!), assim como o Hamas. Infere-se, pela nota do PT, que o Hamas luta pela coexistência de um estado palestino e um estado judeu.

O PT escamoteia a verdade quando diz que “historicamente mantém relações partidárias unicamente com a Organização para a Libertação da Palestina (OLP), assim como com a Autoridade Nacional Palestina sediada em Ramallah”. É tomar o oficial pelo real. A realidade está expressa no entusiasmo do Hamas com a eleição de Lula.

Our trusted NGO partners are on the ground assisting with direct, door-to-door distributions. We are proud to report that we've conducted daily aid deliveries within Israel. 3. Cargo Plane Deliveries: Recently, the first of several cargo planes safely landed in Tel Aviv. These shipments contain critical aid and medical supplies. We have established the necessary infrastructure supply chain and warehouses in Israel through our partner @smartaid to facilitate these efforts. 4. Evacuation Support: GEM is an official partner of the State of Florida, in collaboration with @flgovrondesantis and @flsert  We are assisting U.S. citizens and families evacuating from Israel on recurring flight missions to Tampa, Florida.

instagram,"Um centro judaico de Berlim, que abriga uma sinagoga, foi alvo de um ataque incendiário na madrugada de hoje (18). 

O atentado provocou repúdio entre autoridades alemãs e foi classificado pelo chanceler federal Olaf Scholz como ""desumano"" e ""repugnante"".

Segundo a polícia da capital alemã, dois homens mascarados lançaram coquetéis molotov na direção do edifício por volta de 3h45 (22h45 em Brasília). Os artefatos não chegaram a atingir o prédio, acabando por explodir na calçada em frente. Não foram registrados estragos significativos ou feridos.

Este é só um exemplo de casos antissemitas que vêm acontecendo desde o ataque provocado pelo Hamas no dia 07 de outubro.

instagram,"#是誰轟炸加薩醫院🇮🇱🇵🇸
「加薩醫院爆炸百人慘死，但到底是『誰』攻擊的？」加薩市（Gaza City）的阿赫利醫院（al-Ahli Hospital）10月17日遭到轟炸，造成院內數百人死亡，事件引發中東地區國家大規模抗議示威。
⁡
控制加薩的哈瑪斯（Hamas）指責以色列攻擊醫院，並將之稱為「一場可怕的屠殺」，加薩衛生部發言人庫德拉（Ashraf Al-Qudra）表示救援人員仍在醫院廢墟中搜索，而目前當地的消息仍然混亂，確切的死亡人數仍然未知，加薩民防部門指稱有300人死亡，衛生部指出的死亡人數則是500。
⁡
以色列則否認哈瑪斯的指責，而是將醫院受襲歸咎於加薩的另一個巴勒斯坦武裝組織——伊斯蘭聖戰組織（PIJ），以色列國防軍（IDF）表示「有多個情報來源」表明伊斯蘭聖戰組織在阿赫利醫院附近發射火箭彈失敗，是造成醫院爆炸的元凶。
⁡
以色列陸軍發言人哈加里（Daniel Hagari）指稱，以色列陸軍確定阿赫利醫院發生爆炸時，該地區並未受IDF空軍、海軍或是地面戰攻擊，同時IDF的雷達偵測到附近有火箭彈發射，以IDF攔截的通訊紀錄研判，是伊斯蘭聖戰組織發射了火箭彈。
⁡
哈加里另以無人機空拍鏡頭的畫面指出，造成阿赫利醫院爆炸的武器和以色列軍隊的配備不同，而以色列尚無法確認死亡人數。IDF另發出聲明，表示自加薩衝突爆發以來，當地武裝組織向以色列發射的火箭彈中，大約450枚落在了加薩，「危急和傷害了加薩居民的性命。」
⁡
伊斯蘭聖戰組織駁斥以色列的說法，反指以色列是「極力逃避犯下殘酷屠殺的責任」，並指稱從砲彈的落下角度、爆炸規模和破壞程度，都指向是以色列所為，加上以色列先前的撤離令，伊斯蘭聖戰組織認為這證明阿赫利醫院是以色列的攻擊目標。
⁡
由於以色列連日以來對加薩地區的轟炸，無數巴勒斯坦人逃離家園、躲進醫院避難，包括阿赫利醫院在內的許多醫院都收容了為數眾多的巴勒斯坦難民，醫院受襲卻將這些逃難民眾帶向死亡。
⁡
根據《美聯社》核實的醫院爆炸影片，大樓被火焰吞噬、破碎的遺體散落周圍，其中有很多是年幼孩童。
⁡
救護車和私人汽車緊急將爆炸中的350名傷者送往加薩市的另一所醫院——希法醫院（al-Shifa），希法醫院的院長塞爾米亞（Mohammed Abu Selmia）表示院內本就已經擠滿空襲傷者，眾多沒有床位的傷者渾身是血躺在地上，而希法醫院的資源已經緊繃，醫院發電機燃料也即將在幾個小時內用罄，塞爾米亞說：
⁡
「我們需要設備，我們需要藥物，我們需要床位，我們需要麻藥，我們需要一切。」
⁡
醫院死傷的慘況，已造成外界輿論的譴責壓力，尤其對於中東世界而言，更是直接導向成了憤怒抗爭。
⁡
在新聞曝光之後，約旦河西岸城市便出現成群的巴勒斯坦民眾聚集，政府機構所在的拉馬拉（Ramallah）就有將近百人上街，之中許多人呼喊反對巴勒斯坦自治政府總統阿巴斯（Mahmoud Abbas）的口號，並且向現場維持秩序的安全部隊投擲石塊。根據《衛報》的報導，拉馬拉抗議群眾裡，支持哈瑪斯的激進派領袖也有參與其間。
⁡
而支持哈瑪斯的黎巴嫩真主黨，也隨即號召各地響應「憤怒日」（day of rage），要在美國總統拜登抵達以色列訪問的同時，藉由設立憤怒日來作為反抗象徵。
⁡
就在真主黨率先發生之後，黎巴嫩首都貝魯特的美國和法國的大使館外，就有民眾在當地發生暴力衝突，呼喊「以色列去死」口號，隨後被黎巴嫩的軍警驅離。
⁡
因醫院事件而起的抗議，還包括土耳其、伊朗首都德黑蘭、約旦首都安曼、伊拉克首都巴格達、摩洛哥首都拉巴特、北非利比亞，當地民眾受到事件的刺激，轉為對以色列和美國的強烈憤怒。
⁡
儘管當前國際上尚無法準確證實到底是誰轟炸醫院，但像是土耳其、卡達、約旦、伊朗等國家，則已經咬定是以色列所為。聯合國方面發出聲明譴責這次針對醫院的無差別攻擊，但並沒有說是由誰發動。
⁡
微妙的是，以色列方面反覆強調否認，美國白宮也在18日透露，「已認知到以色列非常強烈地否認和加薩醫院爆炸有關」（recognises that Israel feels ""very strongly"" that a huge blast at a hospital in Gaza City ""was not caused by them""），對比以色列過往針對加薩走廊的攻擊，這一回的強烈否認態度相對罕見。
⁡
各家通訊社如《美聯社》、《路透社》、《法新社》，以及駐員在加薩當地的《BBC》，也都表示目前無法核實以色列和哈瑪斯雙方說法，確切死傷人數也還沒有辦法釐清。而《半島電視台》方面，並沒有和中東世界的憤怒輿論一致，反到同樣謹慎地報導目前有關醫院轟炸的說詞，皆尚未印證。

Man werde die Lieferung begrenzter Mengen von Wasser, Nahrung und Medikamenten zulassen, so lange nichts davon an die militant-islamistische Hamas gehe, teilte das Büro von Ministerpräsident Benjamin Netanjahu am Mittwoch mit. Die Entscheidung sei auf Bitten von US-Präsident Joe Biden getroffen worden.

Der ägyptische Außenminister Samih Schukri bestätigte später, dass Hilfslieferungen über den Grenzübergang Rafah in den Gazastreifen gebracht werden sollen. Wann genau die Hilfe anlaufen soll, sagte er in einem Interview des Senders Al-Arabija am Mittwoch allerdings nicht.

A massive blast at a Gaza City hospital that killed hundreds on Tuesday put immense strain on Gaza doctors treating the wounded as medical supplies and fuel ran out.⁠
⁠
Doctors performed surgery on the hospital floors, often without anesthesia.⁠
⁠
There were conflicting claims of who was responsible for the explosion. Hamas officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying nearly 500 were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.⁠
⁠
The Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties.⁠

instagram,"Så här är det att vara svensk i Bryssel: du får kärleksfulla meddelanden från alla dina vänner av fler olika nationaliteter än du orkar räkna. De ringer för att höra om det är något de kan göra, om du vill ha sällskap på hundpromenaden, om du vill prata. Du träffar människor du inte känner som - när de hör att du är svensk - vill försäkra sig om att du mår bra. 

Jag vet att det var ett tag sen det var kul här inne på mitt konto. Ni får trösta er med att det är värre utanför. Och nu tänkte jag dessutom fylla på med några floskler av typen: låt oss allesammans sjunga We shall Overcome. För nu, när extremisterna utnyttjar terrorismen för att göda sitt eget hat, så är det bra att tänka lite extra på hur just du reagerar. Bryssel har genomgått flera traumatiska terrordåd. Jag tror att vi brysselbor fortfarande bär på dem. Bryssel är en stad som har problem, många lever i utsatthet. Men det är också en vänlig stad vars styrka ligger i mångfalden. Bryssel är på sätt och vis Europas huvudstad för det internationella samarbetet. Det är här NATO har sitt huvudkontor och det är här de flesta EU-institutioner ligger. Just nu är det extra viktigt att ställa krav på alla länders regeringar att agera för solidaritet och medmänsklighet. Vi måste kräva att de lyssnar på FN, Läkare utan gränser, Amnesty för att få stopp på det besinningslösa våldet i Gaza. Men det ställs också krav på oss som individer. Det som Netanyahus Israel utsätter palestinierna för leder till mer antisemitism och alla judar och israeler blir offer. När IS eller Hamas terror mördar oskyldiga människor så leder det till ökad islamofobi och alla muslimer blir offer. Det är vi ansvariga för. Du och jag. Så låt oss hålla fast vid tanken om att fred och medmänsklighet är möjlig.

instagram,"Setidaknya 500 orang dilaporkan tewas dalam serangan udara Israel di Rumah Sakit Arab al-Ahli di Gaza pada Selasa (17/10).

Ini menjadi insiden paling mematikan sejak negara tersebut melancarkan pembalasan atas serangan kelompok Hamas pada 7 Oktober lalu.

Berikut sejumlah reaksi dari berbagai pihak di dunia atas insiden serangan tersebut:
- Israel
Militer Israel membantah bertanggung jawab atas pengeboman tersebut.
""Seluruh dunia harus tahu: Yang menyerang rumah sakit di Gaza adalah teroris biadab di Gaza, dan bukan IDF. Mereka yang secara brutal membunuh anak-anak kita juga membunuh anak-anak mereka sendiri,"" kata Perdana Menteri Israel Benjamin Netanyahu.

- Amerika Serikat (AS)
""Saya marah dan sangat sedih atas ledakan di rumah sakit Arab Al-Ahli di Gaza, dan banyaknya korban jiwa yang diakibatkannya,"" kata Presiden Joe Biden saat dia hendak melakukan kunjungan ke Israel, seperti dikutip AFP.

Dia menambahkan bahwa dia telah ""mengarahkan tim keamanan nasional saya untuk terus mengumpulkan informasi tentang apa yang sebenarnya terjadi.""

- PBB
Sekjen Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa Antonio Guterres merasa ""ngeri"" dengan serangan mematikan di sebuah rumah sakit di Gaza.

""Hati saya bersama keluarga para korban. Rumah sakit dan tenaga medis dilindungi berdasarkan hukum kemanusiaan internasional,"" kata Guterres dalam pesannya di X.

- Liga Arab
Ketua Liga Arab Ahmed Aboul Gheit mengatakan bahwa para pemimpin internasional harus ""segera menghentikan tragedi ini"" sebagai tanggapan atas serangan tersebut.

""Pikiran jahat apa yang dengan sengaja membombardir rumah sakit dan penghuninya yang tidak berdaya?"" tulisnya dalam postingan media sosial. ""Mekanisme Arab akan mendokumentasikan kejahatan perang ini dan para penjahat tidak akan lolos dari tindakan mereka.""

Mais de 1.300 israelenses foram assassinados, dezenas de civis foram sequestrados, bebês foram massacrados, famílias inteiras foram assassinadas, mulheres foram estupradas e pessoas foram queimadas vivas.

O lutador paraense Michel Pereira obteve um êxito extraordinário no UFC Vegas 81, no último sábado (14), quando nocauteou o americano André Petroski ainda no primeiro round. Após a vitória, o paraense levantou uma bandeira de Israel e foi surpreendido com ameaças de morte após a atitude no octógono. 

Em entrevista ao programa The MMA Hour, o atleta explicou que teria levantado a bandeira como forma de homenagear as vítimas israelenses dos ataques do Hamas.

instagram,"As Forças de Defesa de Israel (IDF) divulgaram um áudio nesta madrugada (18) de uma conversa interceptada entre dois terroristas do Hamas. Nela, eles afirmam que o foguete que atingiu o hospital na Faixa de Gaza foi disparado pela Jihad Islâmica, a partir do cemitério que fica atrás do local.  As primeiras imagens divulgadas do ocorrido mostram também que apenas o estacionamento do hospital foi atingido. Isso põe em cheque a afirmação do Ministério da Saúde de Gaza, liderado pelo Hamas, de que cerca de 500 pessoas tenham morrido. O número de vítimas palestinas pode ter sido bem menor.  O presidente dos EUA, Joe Biden, também já está em Israel e, embora insista na necessidade de uma investigação, afirma que não foi o Estado judeu o responsável pela explosão.

instagram,"Carrying signs including the words “I am not a threat”, classmates and friends of six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume stood on an Illinois basketball court on Tuesday night at an emotional vigil for the Muslim boy stabbed to death in an alleged hate crime.

Hundreds of adults, including Dilawar Syed, the highest-ranked Muslim official in the Biden administration, joined the children in Plainfield to pay tribute to the child.

The Palestinian American boy died after he and his mother were stabbed by their landlord, whom authorities say was fueled by rage over the Israel-Hamas war. Joseph Czuba, 71, is charged with first-degree murder. He allegedly yelled Islamophobic sentiments during the attack.

On Tuesday, a succession of speakers paid tribute to a boy known for his smile and love of basketball, and who was born in the US to parents originally from a village in the West Bank.

Wadea’s father, Oday Al-Fayoume, addressed the gathering one day after his son’s funeral. “With Wadea gone, I don’t think there’s room for me to speak English any more,” he said.

Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), said the boy’s mother, who remains in a hospital in Joliet, is “dealing with her injuries, dealing with her emotional trauma and dealing with the biggest hole that can never be filled, the biggest gap of all, the loss of her child”.

Ma Israele nega e punta il dito contro una fallita esplosione di un razzo lanciato proprio dalla Jihad islamica. Una cosa è certa: le vittime – si dice siano tra le 200 e le 500 - ci sono. Forte la reazione della comunità internazionale. A partire dal mondo arabo e dal presidente palestinese Abu Mazen, che ha cancellato l'incontro previsto ad Amman con Joe Biden e indetto tre giorni di lutto nazionale in Cisgiordania. La presidente della Commissione europea Ursula von der Leyen frena: declinato ogni commento in attesa di ""conferme"". Biden, oggi in Israele, si dice ""indignato e profondamente rattristato"". La Russia chiede che Israele fornisca immagini satellitari per dimostrare di non essere dietro all'attacco.

instagram,"Starbucks is suing its union, Starbucks Workers United, after objecting to the group’s social media post in support of Palestine after the Hamas attack on Israel, according to an internal company note circulated Tuesday and obtained by The Intercept.⁠
⁠
The company had previously condemned the post but is now upping the ante, planning to take the union to court. In a message from Executive Vice President Sara Kelly, Starbucks argued that the union’s use of the name Starbucks confuses customers, and that some customers took their anger over the SWU statement out on store employees. ⁠
⁠
The union’s post read “Solidarity with Palestine!” and quote-tweeted an image of a bulldozer breaking through the fence encircling Gaza. More than 9,000 workers at 360 stores have now voted to join SWU, which is affiliated with Workers United and SEIU, according to its website, but they have been met with stiff resistance from the company on a potential contract. The company previously sent SWU a “cease and desist” order threatening legal action and now plans to follow through with that threat.⁠

Numa nota esquiva, em que menciona atos de violência, sem lhes apontar o autor ou a natureza, a diplomacia brasileira tudo fez para resguardar os terroristas.

Entretanto, políticos do PT e de outros partidos de esquerda, bem como agremiações ao estilo do MST, se pronunciaram publicamente contra Israel e na defesa das atrocidades praticadas pelo Hamas, apresentadas como 'resistência legítima'. Mais ainda, em diversas cidades militantes de esquerda fizeram manifestações públicas com apologia ao terrorismo e às atrocidades do Hamas, sem causar qualquer comoção naqueles que se dizem tão preocupados com as instituições, o 'Estado democrático de Direito' e a própria democracia.""

These tunnels predate Hamas, but in 2001 the militant group began the construction of several hundred kilometres of underground warrens.⁠

These spaces will present the greatest challenge to the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) when they begin their invasion of Gaza in the coming days.⁠

instagram,"Ein Sprecher der Hamas in Teheran hat gerade in der ARD Folgendes verkündet: Die Islamische Republik und die Hamas hätten ihre Partnerschaft vertieft, Iran habe seine Unterstützung ausgeweitet. Er erzählte von Kampfschwimmern, die samt Ausrüstung kilometerweit schwimmen können, von ausgebauten Tunneln und weiterentwickelten Kommunikationssystemen.⁠
⁠
In solchen Momenten muss ich an die Nachricht einer Frau denken, die mich während der Proteste in Iran über Instagram erreicht hat. Was wäre, schrieb die iranische Frau, wenn es die Islamische Republik nicht mehr gäbe? Was, wenn wir es schaffen, das Regime zu stürzen? Die Antworten auf ihre Fragen zielen mitten ins Heute.⁠
⁠
Dann würden wir in einem Land leben, das befreundet wäre mit Israel.⁠
⁠
Dann bräuchte Israel weniger Waffen und Saudi-Arabien auch.⁠
⁠
Es gäbe keinen Krieg im Jemen. Irak könnte seine eigene Politik bestimmen.⁠
⁠
Die Hisbollah und die Hamas hätten keinen Finanzierer mehr.⁠
⁠
Russland würde keine Drohnen und Mittelstreckenraketen mehr geliefert bekommen, die sie im Krieg gegen die Ukraine einsetzen.⁠
⁠
Putin hätte keinen mächtigen Verbündeten mehr in der Region.⁠
⁠
Assad hätte einen Unterstützer weniger.⁠
⁠
Die Gefängnisse, in denen politische Gefangenen sitzen, wären leer.⁠
⁠
Man müsste sich nicht mehr fürchten vor einer Atombombe in den Händen der Mullas.⁠
⁠
Es gäbe einen neuen Markt, der offen wäre für einen enormen Nachholbedarf an Investitionen. Allein für Deutschland 20 Milliarden Investitionen - pro Jahr.⁠

Und vielleicht wäre eine Frau Präsidentin, die als ersten Amtsakt nach Yad Vashem ginge.⁠

Gute Vorstellung. Die bittere Wahrheit ist: Statt das Problem in Iran anzugehen, hilft der Westen dem Brandstifter noch, Holz zu holen.⁠

instagram,"Der slowenische Philosoph Slavoj Žižek hat bei der Eröffnungsfeier der Frankfurter Buchmesse für Aufsehen gesorgt. In seiner Rede setzte er sich für die im Gazastreifen lebenden Palästinenser ein. Obwohl er die Attacken der Hamas verurteilte und Israel das Recht zur Selbstverteidigung zusprach, betonte Žižek die Notwendigkeit, den Hintergrund der Situation in Palästina zu analysieren. 

Er kritisierte, dass das palästinensische Volk in Gaza oft nur als Problem betrachtet wird und dass Israel ihnen keine positive Rolle im Nahostkonflikt zuweise. Der Terrorismus gegen Israel widerspreche allen Werten der Buchmesse. Genauso sei aber „die kollektive Bestrafung von Millionen in Gaza“ ein Widerspruch.

Der Direktor der Buchmesse, Juergen Boos, erklärte nach Žižeks Rede, dass es wichtig sei, die Meinungsfreiheit zu respektieren, auch wenn man die Ansichten nicht teile. Es sei wichtig, ""dass wir uns zuhören"". Boos kritisierte aber die von Žižek gewählten Worte. „Ich glaube, ich kann für diese Gemeinde hier sprechen, wenn ich sage: Wir verurteilen den Terror. Wir sind Menschen und wir denken menschlich - auf palästinensischer und auf israelischer Seite.“

instagram,"Hundreds of San Francisco high school students and students from across the country walked out of classes Wednesday to protest ongoing violence in Gaza and call for an immediate ceasefire.

The walkout led by Arab Youth Organizing came after an explosion at a hospital where the Hamas-run Health Ministry says at least 500 people were killed, though the event was conceived of earlier by a San Francisco high school student whose family is from Gaza, organizers said. More than 3,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, including over 1,100 children, according to organizers.

A couple of hundred students marched along Francisco Street before turning onto Van Ness Avenue and walking toward Bay Street from Galileo High School. At the head of the line, a student held the Palestinian flag. Other students chanted, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""

The White House says current intelligence shows that Israel was “not responsible” for the explosion at a Gaza hospital, but information is still being collected. Hamas blames Israel.

Students are demanding an end to U.S. aid to Israel, arguing the funding enables Israel's military strikes on Gaza. The U.S. provides about $3.8 billion a year in aid to Israel.

Organizers held a news conference outside San Francisco City Hall at 10 a.m. ahead of the planned walkout. Speakers included local officials, religious leaders, labor leaders and community organizers.

Um desafio que se tornou mais difícil com a indignação que varreu o Médio Oriente após a morte de centenas de pessoas num hospital na Faixa de Gaza.

O presidente americano, disse isto na sua reunião em Tel Aviv com o primeiro-ministro israelense, Benyamin Netanyahu: 
 
“Estou profundamente triste e indignado com a explosão que ocorreu ontem no hospital de Gaza. Com base no que vi, parece que foi feito pelo outro lado, não por vocês. Mas há muitas pessoas por aí que não têm a certeza, por isso temos muitas coisas a superar”. 

Ao reiterar que “os Estados Unidos darão a Israel o que necessita para se defender, Biden concluiu dizendo que “a coragem do povo israelense foi surpreendente e que eles estavam orgulhosos de estar lá”.

O primeiro-ministro israelense, Benjamin Netanyahu, disse isso ao presidente dos EUA, Joe Biden, em Tel Aviv: 

“Assim como o mundo se uniu para derrotar o nazismo e se uniu para derrotar o ISIS, devemos estar unidos para derrotar o Hamas.
Israel está unido para derrotar o Hamas.""

instagram,"🇧🇷⚠️O PL 5.016/2023 dispõe sobre o cancelamento de vistos e extradição em caso de apoio a organizações terroristas.

O projeto entende como ""apoio a organizações terroristas"" qualquer ação, expressão ou manifestação pública que ""promova, financie, incentive ou colabore de qualquer forma com organizações consideradas terroristas, conforme as listas oficiais de organizações terroristas mantidas pelo Estado Brasileiro"".

Os estrangeiros que tiverem seus vistos cancelados, terão direito à ampla defesa e ao contraditório, podendo contestar a decisão. Contudo, se o cancelamento de visto for confirmado após a conclusão do devido processo legal, ""o estrangeiro estará sujeito a procedimentos de extradição"".

Segundo a deputada, o projeto faz-se necessário para ""proteger a soberania, a segurança e a integridade do Brasil"". 

""Em um cenário de conflito no Oriente Médio, com ações de terror perpetradas contra o Estado de Israel por parte do grupo Hamas, no qual mais de 1.400 israelenses já tiveram suas vidas ceifadas, é fundamental que adotemos medidas robustas para mitigar riscos e garantir a ordem pública, bem como demonstrar a aversão total do Estado Brasileiro com manifestações de apoio e fomento de grupos terroristas"", diz o PL. 

Embora seja considerado um grupo terrorista por toda a União Europeia, Estados Unidos, Japão, Canadá, Reino Unido e naturalmente Israel, o Brasil não considera o Hamas um grupo terrorista.

Segundo o Itamaraty, o Hamas não é considerado um grupo terrorista porque o Brasil segue as avaliações do Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas (ONU) na designação de grupos considerados terroristas.

“O Conselho de Segurança mantém listas de indivíduos e entidades qualificados como terroristas, contra os quais se aplicam sanções. Estão incluídos o Estado Islâmico e a Al-Qaeda, além de grupos menos conhecidos do grande público”, diz o governo.

O Conselho de Segurança da ONU rejeitou a proposta do Brasil de uma resolução sobre o conflito entre Israel e a Palestina nesta quarta (18). O projeto recebeu 12 votos a favor, com abstenções do Reino Unido e da Rússia, e o único voto contra foi dos Estados Unidos. Em visita a Israel hoje, Joe Biden declarou apoio irrestrito ao país.

A resolução brasileira solicitava a abertura de corredores humanitários em Gaza, condenando os ataques do Hamas, e pedindo pausas na guerra para atendimento aos civis e a retomada de serviços essenciais.

O Conselho de Segurança não aprova uma resolução sobre a crise no Oriente Médio desde 2016 – já que essas decisões devem sem aprovadas por todos os membros-permanentes (China, EUA, França, Reino Unido e Rússia).

O Representante da Rússia na ONU, Vasily Nebenzya, classificou o veto dos EUA como um “fracasso da política externa”. “Acabamos de testemunhar outra manifestação da hipocrisia e dos padrões duplos dos nossos colegas americanos”, afirmou Nebenzya.

Ariel había salido a hacer deporte en la mañana del sábado 7/10 cuando los terroristas del Hamas irrumpieron en su casa. 

Esto le salvó la vida.

instagram,"Since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th, Americans have got the steady leadership most of them voted for in 2020, and they have been reminded of the pettiness and volatility they rejected. ⁠
⁠
Donald Trump, who has not forgiven Binyamin Netanyahu for congratulating Joe Biden on being elected, has lashed out at Israel’s prime minister, for instance.⁠
⁠
But while Joe Biden has been forthright that Israel has not just a right but “a duty” to defend itself, he has also been deft in urging restraint. ⁠
⁠
Now comes the hard part. Gazans are already suffering and dying under Israeli siege and bombardment, and a ground invasion will cause far more agony, as Hamas hopes. And an invasion will increase the chance of a wider war. ⁠

instagram,"""Today the eyes of the world are on Gaza where, assuming that Israel’s leaders are to be believed, the Netanyahu government is contemplating one of the greatest crimes of the 21st century.

With global attention riveted on this unfolding disaster, care should be taken not to overlook events elsewhere that might ultimately prove equally consequential.

Do not forget the Occupied West Bank.

On 10 October, four people were shot dead by settlers in the Palestinian town of Qusra. Then, when relatives gathered to mourn the dead less than 24 hours later, the settlers returned to claim two more lives as they opened fire on the funeral procession.

In Hebron, on 13 October, settlers opened fire on worshippers leaving their mosque after Friday prayers.

The settlers operate with virtual impunity. They have strong political backing inside the Netanyahu government, and can rely on the support of the Israeli army.

At least 61 Palestinians are reported to have been killed and over 1,100 wounded in the West Bank over the past week.

Since Palestinian fighters’ lethal assault on Israel last weekend, UN observers have recorded 70 attacks by Israeli settlers causing property damage or casualties - nearly three times the rate recorded since the start of the year.

The question is how much worse the situation will get. The signs are bleak.

Even before Hamas's attack of 7 October, there were already unmistakable signs that the Israeli government was looking at ways of driving Palestinians out of parts of the West Bank.

For Israel’s militant settler movement, this is their time. With the world looking the other way.""

Em seu perfil no X, antigo Twitter, Fernanda de Melo postou a notícia da morte da brasileira com a frase: “Foi tarde”. A postagem chegou a provocar reações da Câmara dos Deputados. Carla Zambelli e Cabo Gilberto Silva enviaram ofícios à UEPB pedindo o cancelamento do evento.

Depois da repercussão do comentário, ela apagou seus perfis nas redes sociais. A palestra na UEPB tinha como tema “Entendendo o conflito entre Israel e Palestina: religião, território e vi0lência” e aconteceria no sábado (14/10).

Antes disso, na terça-feira (10/10), em uma entrevista, a palestrante já havia acusado Israel de cometer “crimes de guerra” na Faixa de Gaza e afirmado que os ataques do Hamas seriam uma “resposta ao apartheid” promovido na região.

Lunedì è stato annunciato dalle forze di difesa israeliane che 199 ostaggi (tra cui anche bambini) sono trattenuti da Hamas.

Per questo, il patriarca italiano si è offerto in cambio della libertà di quei bambini.

In questi giorni di odio e violenza, lui è stato testimonianza di Amore.🙏🏻

instagram,"Dieci giorni fa sono tornata a terra dopo sei settimane in nave e due viaggi nel buco nero dell'Europa, noto anche come mar Mediterraneo. Son tornata dopo tante cose, compreso aver incontrato la morte in mezzo all'acqua in una notte senza luna; una volta ha vinto lei, 105 volte abbiamo vinto noi. Sono tornata a casa e avevo bisogno di dormire, sono tornata a terra e avevo bisogno di vita - invece ho aperto i giornali e ho trovato Israele e Palestina. Ho richiuso i giornali, e la bocca, per qualche giorno.

Io non sono un'esperta dell'area, non lo sono mai stata. Il mio non è un parere geopolitico sulla regione, è una sfinita, triste considerazione su quello che fa la guerra alle persone, comprese quelle che stanno in Italia. 

Quello che è successo in queste settimane è l'ennesimo atto di una guerra. Che esisteva anche quando la ignoravamo, deliberatamente o perché ""non ci si può occupare di tutto"". La guerra c'era già. Siamo noi che eravamo distratti.

Niente, niente può giustificare i massacri di civili. Hamas non ha alcuna giustificazione; nessuna sofferenza del popolo palestinese può giustificare crimini contro i civili. Il governo di Israele non ha alcuna giustificazione: nessuna sofferenza del popolo israeliano può giustificare crimini contro civili.

""Maestra, ha iniziato lui!"" si dice solo all'asilo. Quello che conta, in una guerra, è chi la fa finire. È solo quella la cosa importante, finirla, e finirla nel modo giusto - cioè che non siano le basi per la prossima guerra.

Hamas mi sembra il peggior nemico del popolo palestinese, il governo di Tel Aviv il peggior nemico del popolo israeliano.

⁣O presidente da Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelensky, pediu para viajar a Israel, a fim de demonstrar solidariedade ao país em guerra contra o Hamas. 

No entanto, o governo israelense recusou a visita do líder ucraniano.

Segundo a mídia de Israel, o governo decidiu que “não é a hora certa” para a ida de Zelensky. 

Apesar de a viagem não ter sido aprovada, o presidente da Ucrânia conversou com Benjamin Netanyahu, primeiro-ministro israelense, por telefone, após o recomeço dos conflitos na região.

Zelensky falou a favor de Israel desde os primeiros ataques do Hamas no dia 7 deste mês e afirmou ser direito dos israelenses se defenderem das ofensivas do grupo extremista.

“Terror é sempre um crime, não apenas contra um país ou vítimas específicas, mas contra a humanidade como um todo”, disse.

Há mais de um ano, Zelensky enfrenta um conflito armado com a Rússia e, na semana passada, acusou ser de interesse russo “inflamar a guerra no Oriente Médio, para criar uma nova fonte de dor e sofrimento”.

Crise na Faixa de Gaza

A Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) informou que restam “24 horas de água, eletricidade e combustível” na Faixa de Gaza. 

Após esse prazo, “uma verdadeira catástrofe” vai se instalar na região. Ahmed Al-Mandhari, diretor regional da OMS para o Mediterrâneo Oriental, pediu autorização para a entrada de comboios de ajuda.

Vários funcionários da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) reforçaram o pedido de entrada desse apoio. Um deles foi o secretário-geral para assuntos humanitários da ONU, Martin Griffiths, que tem conversado com autoridades no Egito e em Israel.

Nesta segunda-feira (16/10), Griffiths afirmou estar trabalhando “para encontrar uma maneira de levar seus suprimentos de ajuda para Gaza”. Segundo ele, o envolvimento de Blinken “foi muito útil”.

instagram,"A Universidade Estadual da Paraíba (UEPB) cancelou uma palestra que teria a presença da bacharel em Relações Internacionais Fernanda de Melo.

Aluna de pós-graduação na Escola de Artes, Ciências e Humanidades (EACH) da Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Fernanda virou alvo de críticas nas redes sociais depois de comemorar a morte da brasileira Bruna Valeanu, ass4ssinada pelo Hamas em Israel.

Em seu perfil no X, antigo Twitter, Fernanda de Melo postou a notícia da morte da brasileira com a frase: “Foi tarde”. A postagem chegou a provocar reações da Câmara dos Deputados. Carla Zambelli e Cabo Gilberto Silva enviaram ofícios à UEPB pedindo o cancelamento do evento.

Depois da repercussão do comentário, ela apagou seus perfis nas redes sociais. A palestra na UEPB tinha como tema “Entendendo o conflito entre Israel e Palestina: religião, território e vi0lência” e aconteceria no sábado (14/10).

Antes disso, na terça-feira (10/10), em uma entrevista, a palestrante já havia acusado Israel de cometer “crimes de guerra” na Faixa de Gaza e afirmado que os ataques do Hamas seriam uma “resposta ao apartheid” promovido na região.

instagram,"This past week and a half has been like no other for Jewish families across the world. We witnessed the biggest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, we saw images and videos that will haunt us forever, like those of our forbears have, and we’ve cried and hugged our kids like never before.

Babies, Holocaust survivors, lifelong peace activists, agriculturalists feeding starving children, black, white, old, young, disabled… none were spared. And now up to 199 hostages, including babies, sit captive in Gaza with desperate families waiting for news.

And then yesterday, those same terrorists who committed these atrocities, who live-streamed them, blamed Israel for bombing a hospital. That’s now been shown (even from live AlJezeera TV) to have been a misfired rocket launched by Islamic Jihad in Gaza.

What has been so hurtful at home, has been the denial of atrocities, the tearing down or defacing of posters of missing children, and the willingness of so many to believe anything Hamas tells them with no evidence at all.

From the BBC to hero footballers to politicians to ‘peace activists’, so many were quick to follow their gut, and show us their true feelings about the one Jewish state in the world.

As I looked on social media last night I was physically shaking. At least one such post has more likes than the official number of Jews who live in the UK.

Jews in the UK have been subject to a 581% increase in antisemitic incidents since the 7/10 attacks in Israel. Police believe incidents may be underreported and urge anyone to please contact them with anything to report.

Since fighting anti-Jewish hate, I learnt the saying that antisemitism is a light-sleeper and it certainly feels to many of us it’s wide awake.

The pain expressed by Jewish people does not diminish that of innocents in Gaza, with whom we all share a common enemy - the terrorists.

instagram,"EXPLICAÇÕES | O deputado estadual delegado Lucas (PP-RO), autor do decreto lei que concedeu o ""título honorífico de cidadão honorário do Estado de Rondônia"" a Benjamin Netanyahu, afirmou que está avaliando uma possibilidade jurídica de revogar a concessão da honraria ao primeiro-ministro israelense.

O parlamentar explicou, em uma nota de esclarecimento publicada em suas redes sociais, que o projeto para homenagear Netanyahu surgiu depois que ele foi convidado a compor a Frente Parlamentar Brasil-Israel, criada pela bancada federal e com participação de Assembleias Estaduais. Ele mencionou a previsão de uma viagem em comitiva para o país do Oriente Médio.

Especificamente sobre o decreto, o deputado rondoniense disse que a proposta foi debatida na segunda quinzena de setembro e redigida em 3 de outubro, antes do conflito entre Israel e Hamas. ""Infelizmente o protocolo do documento só ocorreu no dia 9 de outubro, quando os bombardeios já tinham iniciado"", diz o posicionamento.

instagram,"“What Hamas did two weekends ago was not a departure from its past, but the natural culmination of its commitments,” Yair Rosenberg writes. “The question is not why Hamas did what it did, but why so many people were surprised.”⁠
⁠
Before Hamas’s attack on Israel, murdering more than 1,300 Israelis, almost all civilians, and abducting some 150 others, the consensus among many was that Hamas was a mostly rational actor that could be reasoned with, Rosenberg writes. “To hawks, although the group was an anti-Semitic Iran proxy, it could be deterred through political and economic incentives, because it felt responsible for the welfare of the Gazan people. To doves, Hamas was a quasi-legitimate national resistance movement whose occasional bouts of violence were simply intended to draw attention to that struggle.” Even successive Netanyahu governments, far less sympathetic to the Gazans’ plight, spent years lifting restrictions in exchange for what they thought would be relative quiet.⁠
⁠
“But it turned out that Hamas wasn’t being pacified; it was preparing,” Rosenberg continues at the link in our bio. “The group was less committed to national liberation than to Jewish elimination. Its violence was rooted not in strategy, but in sadism. And in retrospect, well before the Rosh Hashanah plot, the signs of Hamas’s atrocious ambitions were all there—many observers just did not want to believe them … Many got Hamas wrong. But they shouldn’t have. Again and again, people say they intend to murder Jews. And yet, century after century, the world produces new, tortuous justifications for why anti-Jewish bigots don’t really mean what they say—even though they do.”⁠

instagram,"🇨🇭 🇵🇸 La Suisse a condamné la frappe meurtrière sur un hôpital de la bande de Gaza mardi. Berne exige une enquête approfondie sur les faits.

""La Suisse rappelle que les hôpitaux et les civils doivent être protégés en tout temps en vertu du droit international humanitaire"", a écrit mardi soir le Département fédéral des affaires étrangères (DFAE) sur la plateforme X, anciennement Twitter, rejoignant une vague de condamnations dans le monde entier.

Cette frappe dont Israël et les Palestiniens se rejettent la responsabilité a fait mardi des centaines de morts dans un hôpital à Gaza. Elle est intervenue quelques heures avant l'arrivée du président américain Joe Biden dans la région.

Le mouvement islamiste Hamas au pouvoir à Gaza a accusé Israël d'être à l'origine de cette frappe, que l'armée israélienne a elle imputée à un tir de roquette du Jihad islamique, autre groupe armé palestinien. Le Jihad islamique a démenti et a mis lui aussi en cause l'Etat hébreu.

One of working together in common purpose, and another of destruction and terrorism. It is the responsibility of all of us who believe in that first path – normalizing relations and upholding and bringing forth the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people – to make that a real, clear, and affirmative choice.

That has been a critical message in my efforts over the past week as I have met around the clock with leaders from Israel, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. And it will remain a priority in the days ahead.

Israel was attacked by Hamas – a terrorist organization. And it has the right and duty to defend its people from Hamas and prevent future attacks, but how Israel does this matters. It needs to be done in a way that affirms our shared values for human life and human dignity, taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.

At our request, the United States and Israel will develop a plan to enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza.

instagram,"The truth matters. The hospital wasn't even hit; it was a parking lot next to it. Moral of the story: don't jump to conclusions amidst the fog of war.

The US government assesses that Israel “was not responsible” for the blast at a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday, according to the National Security Council, following President Joe Biden’s comments that a Palestinian militant group was behind the strike.

A spokesperson for the NSC, Adrienne Watson, said the assessment was based on available reporting, including “intelligence, missile activity, and open source video and images of the incident.”

“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” Watson said in a statement on Wednesday.

The NSC followed up with an additional statement Wednesday afternoon leaning further into its assessment. “Intelligence indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed that the explosion was likely caused by an errant rocket or missile launch carried out by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The militants were still investigating what had happened,” Watson said.

Israeli officials have released audio of what they say is Hamas militants discussing the blast and attributing it to a rocket launched by PIJ.

Officials told CNN separately that the initial evidence gathered by the US intelligence community suggests that the hospital strike came from a rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group.

Among the evidence that’s been gathered is a blast analysis that suggests it was a ground explosion rather than an airstrike that hit the hospital, one of the sources said. There was no singular crater suggesting there was a bomb, but there was extensive fire damage and scattered debris that is consistent with an explosion starting from the ground level, according to the source.

That analysis is one datapoint that’s led intelligence officials to lean toward assessing that the attack on the hospital was a rocket launch gone wrong.",,6369,"{'like_count': 5053, 'comment_count': 1316, 'num_users': 487041}",Occupy Democrats,,2023-10-18 23:16:14,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/315015613_480460327234839_698737331960826416_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=CNotb3vRtVAAX9w3947&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfDVteHw1xzcD4RDUL9WxX1rZAUodgxn8s_BzL2D-tZq_Q&oe=655A653A,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyjupk9xXc6/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392938947_736431755169710_8929359309189246772_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=5bBmlKDVKSMAX9kfU3M&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAHV3-cKQiNTz5KhuQsbLfi94jB9kzXAaoYYUpe6te_jw&oe=6535E72E

instagram,"O presidente dos Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, apoiou nesta quarta-feira, 18 de outubro, durante uma visita a Israel, a versão do país que as milícias são responsáveis pelo bombardeio de um hospital de Gaza que deixou centenas de mortos, uma tragédia que aumentou ainda mais a tensão no conflito entre o Estado hebreu e o grupo terrorista Hamas

Os países árabes atribuem o bombardeio de terça-feira, 17 de outubro, a Israel, que ataca sem trégua a Faixa de Gaza desde o início da guerra, desencadeada em 7 de outubro por uma ofensiva de terroristas do Hamas em seu território que deixou mais de 1.400 mortos e quase 200 reféns sequestrados

Biden, no entanto, apoiou a versão das autoridades israelenses, que acusam a Jihad Islâmica, outro grupo armado palestino, pelo bombardeio. “Com base no que eu vi, parece que [a explosão] foi causada pelo outro lado, não por vocês”, disse Biden ao primeiro-ministro israelense Benjamin Netanyahu

instagram,"In a speech in Israel, President Joe Biden urged Israelis not to repeat the mistakes the United States made following the 9/11 attacks in Israel’s own response to the Hamas attacks that have reportedly left at least 1,400 Israelis dead since Oct. 7.⁠
⁠
“I caution this, that while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it,” Biden said in public remarks in Tel Aviv. “After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.”⁠
⁠
Biden’s warning about overreaching in response to a traumatic event may be his most explicit call for Israeli restraint in its war on Gaza. It comes, however, as his administration has squashed public communications that mention “de-escalation,” “ceasefire,” “end to violence/bloodshed” and “restoring calm,” according to a HuffPost report. The president has also struck an unflinching pro-Israel stance, moving a carrier strike group off the coast of Israel and promising billions in military aid.⁠

instagram,"O bomb4rdeio que atingiu o hospital al-Ahli Arab, na cidade de Gaza, nesta terça-feira (17/10), alimenta desinformação sobre o acirramento do conflito entre Israel e o grupo islâmico Hamas. O ataque deixou centenas de mort0s e feridos, segundo palestinos, e foi alvo de críticas de países árabes e ocidentais.

O Ministério da Saúde da Palestina defendeu, inicialmente, que o ataque ao hospital teria sido provocado por bombardeios de Israel. O posicionamento se baseia, principalmente, nas ações militares das Forças Armadas israelenses contra a Faixa de Gaza, dominada pelo Hamas desde 2007.

Por sua vez, o governo de Israel alegou que não se responsabiliza pelo ataque e que, segundo informações da inteligência israelense, o bombardeio teria sido provocado por um lançamento de ataque “fracassado” por parte da organização Jihad Islâmica Palestina.

A Jihad Islâmica é uma organização militante que desempenha importante papel no conflito entre Israel e Palestina. Fundada na década de 1980, ela é conhecida pela postura radical e pelas ligações estreitas com o Irã.

A organização tem como objetivo central a destruição de Israel e a criação de um Estado palestino islâmico. Os membros da Jihad defendem a resistência arm4da como meio legítimo de alcançar êxito nos seus propósitos.

O primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, também culpou a Jihad Islâmica e chamou o grupo de “terror1stas bárbaros”.

No entanto, Daoud Shehab, porta-voz da Jihad Islâmica, afirmou ao jornal norte-americano New York Times que o braço armado do grupo não tem atuado na região. “Não houve nenhuma operação das Brigadas Al-Quds na área”, ressaltou Shehab.

instagram,"Martedì sera c’è stata un’esplosione all’ospedale di al Ahli, nella città di Gaza: non si sa ancora esattamente dove sia avvenuta, anche se le prime immagini e ricostruzioni sembrano indicare il parcheggio della struttura. Non è nemmeno chiaro cosa abbia causato l’esplosione e quante persone siano state uccise.

Hamas ha accusato Israele, sostenendo che l’ospedale sia stato colpito in un bombardamento israeliano, mentre Israele ha dato la responsabilità al Jihad Islamico, gruppo radicale della Striscia di Gaza, dicendo che l’esplosione sarebbe stata causata da un razzo lanciato dalla Striscia. Il portavoce del Jihad Islamico ha detto però che il gruppo non è responsabile.

Per quanto riguarda i morti, secondo il ministero della Salute della Striscia (cioè secondo Hamas) sarebbero state uccise 471 persone. È un numero che va preso con cautela, ma se fosse confermato si tratterebbe di uno dei peggiori bombardamenti sul territorio della Striscia di Gaza degli ultimi decenni.

Sui social network stanno girando molti tentativi di analisi di quello che è successo, basate sui video e sulle immagini disponibili, ma nessuna sembra particolarmente definitiva.

Al momento le interpretazioni si dividono fra chi ritiene che l’esplosione sia stata causata da un razzo palestinese che abbia avuto un qualche malfunzionamento, e chi da un missile israeliano. Esiste poi una terza ipotesi, cioè che l’ospedale sia stato colpito dai detriti di un razzo palestinese intercettato da un missile israeliano. Nessuna delle tre è stata confermata ufficialmente, e vanno quindi prese con enorme cautela.

A large group of protesters have swarmed the Cannon House office building Wednesday calling for an Israeli cease-fire. According to WUSA9 hundreds of people have been arrested. 
_______________________________________________
“Demonstrations are not allowed inside Congressional Buildings,” the U.S. Capitol Police shared on X today. “We warned the protestors to stop demonstrating and when they did not comply we began arresting them.” In a follow up tweet U.S. Capitol police added, “arrests in Canon Rotunda and the rolling road closures are ongoing. Amongst these arrests, three people have been arrested and charged with assault on a police officer during processing.” 
_______________________________________________
The protest, that was started by the Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and IfNotNow, took place at noon in front of the Capitol. Demonstrators urged Congress take action toward a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. “The root of violence is oppression, and we’re here to say no in our names,” Jewish Voice for Peace posted on X. “We have the power to stop the ongoing atrocities against Palestinians. We refuse to standby as the Israeli government commits genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”

😞 Nelle ultime settimane l'attenzione mediatica è stata fortemente incentrata nel medio oriente, con la guerra tra Israele 🇮🇱 e Hamas che ha visto un accendersi del conflitto ⚔️ ormai in corso da anni. Molti su Instagram hanno mandato un messaggio di supporto postando bandiere della Palestina e Gemitaiz ha voluto dire la sua sull'argomento.

👉🏻 «Magari evitate de mette le bandiera della Palestina 🇵🇸 nelle storie tra na foto de un culo e una de na discoteca perchè ve assicuro è cringe», queste sono state le parole del rapper romano scritte su X 🐦 che ha quindi criticato chi ha questa usanza sui social.

instagram,"Am Morgen des 7. Oktobers überfielen Terroristen der Hamas Israel und töteten bei dem antisemitischen Angriff tausende Menschen, nahmen geschätzt 200 Geiseln und verschleppten sie nach Gaza. Seitdem befindet sich die Region im Ausnahmezustand: Israel reagiert mit Härte, plant eine Bodenoffensive auf einem der am dichtesten besiedelten Gebiete der Welt. Die Strom- und Wasserversorgung wurde zum Teil abgeriegelt, die Hälfte der 2,3 Millionen Palästinenser:innen wurden von der israelischen Regierung aufgefordert, in den Süden des Gazastreifens zu fliehen.

Der Schock, über das was passiert ist und weiter passiert, sitzt tief. Und doch stellen sich viele Israelis Fragen, die nur schwer zu beantworten sind: Wie konnte es zu diesem Großangriff, zu diesem Blutbad kommen? Wer trägt die Verantwortung? Welche Folgen hat der Krieg für Israel und die gesamte Region?

instagram,"500 morts dans le bombardement d’un hôpital à Gaza, le Hamas et Israël se rejettent la responsabilité

Au moins 500 personnes ont été tuées mardi 17 octobre au soir dans une frappe israélienne sur l’enceinte de l’hôpital baptiste Ahli-Arab, dans le centre de Gaza City, ont rapporté les autorités de l’enclave palestinienne citées par plusieurs médias. Dans un précédent communiqué, le ministère de la santé du territoire palestinien contrôlé par le Hamas faisait état de « 200 à 300 martyrs ».

Le premier ministre israélien, Benyamin Nétanyahou, a rejeté la responsabilité sur les « terroristes barbares » du Hamas. Ce sont eux « qui ont attaqué l’hôpital de Gaza, et non les forces armées israéliennes », a-t-il dit dans un communiqué, ajoutant : « Ceux qui ont brutalement assassiné nos enfants assassinent également leurs propres enfants. »

Sur X (ex-Twitter), le président israélien, Isaac Herzog, a affirmé qu’« un missile du Jihad islamique [allié du Hamas – ndlr], a tué de nombreux Palestiniens dans un hôpital de Gaza ». « Honte aux médias qui avalent les mensonges du Hamas et du Jihad islamique et diffusent dans le monde entier une diffamation sanglante du XXe siècle », a-t-il écrit. 

Peu auparavant, l’armée israélienne, citée par plusieurs médias israéliens, expliquait que « d’après une analyse des systèmes opérationnels de l’armée israélienne, un barrage de roquettes ennemies a été effectué en direction d’Israël, qui est passé à proximité de l’hôpital, lorsqu’il a été touché ».

« Nous étions en train d’opérer à l’hôpital, il y a eu une forte explosion, et le plafond de la salle d’opération est tombé. C’est un massacre », a déclaré le docteur Ghassan Abu Sittah, médecin MSF à Gaza, cité par l’ONG internationale.

Le ministère de la santé palestinien a déclaré que le nombre de victimes devrait augmenter. De nombreux civils s’étaient réfugiés dans l’hôpital Ahli-Arab avant qu’il ne soit touché.

instagram,"Hundreds of pro-Palestine supporters gathered in San Francisco's Dolores Park for a candlelight vigil Tuesday to honor the lives lost in Gaza since last week’s attack by Hamas militants on Israeli citizens that sparked the latest Israel-Hamas war.

Most of the attendees held candles and some waved Palestinian flags as speakers passionately pleaded with the crowd. The crowd broke out in chants to “Free free Palestine” and “Long Live Palestine.” Others held up signs that read “Cease fire in Gaza Now!”.

The vigil was partly a response to the killings Tuesday of hundreds of people during a rocket blast that destroyed a Gaza City hospital filled with wounded Palestinians and others seeking shelter. Following the blast, both Hamas and Israel blamed each other for the attack.

“We won’t accept watching our people die on TV,” one woman at the vigil said. “Every person whose life was lost is a fire for us to continue that fight here.”

instagram,"Op 7 oktober heeft de Palestijnse beweging Hamas een terreuraanval op Israël gepleegd. Daarbij vielen tot nu toe aan Israëlische zijde meer dan 1400 doden.

Als reactie heeft Israël de toevoer van water, voedsel, elektriciteit en benzine aan de Gazastrook stopgezet. Ook worden gebouwen daar door Israël gebombardeerd. In totaal vielen sinds 7 oktober meer dan 3300 doden aan Palestijnse zijde. Het is onduidelijk of ook de doden van het bombardement op het ziekenhuis in Gaza-Stad op 17 oktober zijn meegeteld.

Het conflict tussen Israël en Palestina duurt al tientallen jaren.

📄 Motie van het lid Van Baarle over zich in de meest felle bewoordingen uitspreken tegen de blokkade van Gaza en de vergeldingsacties van het Israëlische leger
🗓 17 oktober 2023 

✅ Palestijnen in Gaza zijn het slachtoffer van de blokkade en krijgen geen medicatie, water en voedsel.
✅ Internationale organisaties zeggen dat er schendingen van het humanitair oorlogsrecht zijn.

❌ Sommigen willen wel dat er water en andere goederen terecht komen bij onschuldige mensen in Gaza, maar zijn het oneens met het woord ‘vergeldingsacties’.
❌ Israël heeft ook het recht op zelfverdediging, met inachtneming van het internationaal recht. 
❌ In een conflict als dit moet eerst onderzocht worden of dit een oorlogsmisdaad is.

instagram,"Killing children and innocent civilians, denying access to food, water and medicines has nothing to do with the right of Israel to defend itself.

Genocide Watch considers the war in Israel and Gaza to be at Stage 3: Discrimination, Stage 4: Dehumanization, Stage 5: Organization, Stage 6: Polarization, Stage 8: Persecution, and Stage 9: Extermination. 

Genocide Watch recommends: 
_All hostages held by Hamas must be freed immediately and returned to Israel. 
_The Israeli blockade of medicines, food, and water to Gaza should end immediately. 
_Military aid to Israel should be conditional on Israel’s adherence to the laws of war. 
_Humanitarian corridors to safe areas must be free from bombing and ground attacks.  _Hamas and Israel must halt all attacks that kill or injure civilians.

US President Joe Biden has arrived in Israel in a desperate bid to prevent the war with Hamas from spiralling into a wider conflict after a devastating blast on a Gaza hospital killed 500 people. 

Biden was received by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he touched down at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv this morning amid warnings the war is 'spiralling out of control' following the deadly fireball explosion at the hospital.

A huge blast ripped through the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City last night while it was being used to treat and shelter thousands of civilians who were trying to avoid Israel's relentless airstrikes. 

Earlier on, President Biden was left outraged and deeply saddened"" by hospital explosion in Gaza

""I am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted,"" he said. 

""Immediately upon hearing this news, I spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened. The United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy.""",,6069,"{'like_count': 5220, 'comment_count': 849, 'num_users': 2348308}",Lindaikejiblog,,2023-10-18 09:48:19,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/203350425_509791997028301_6352041437644260111_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=awR2DqVxWCQAX_ZXF7v&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBaEjsEoe5UmOwZYuy6CByXzFHs6AYuiQ9dAMX2K9QtPg&oe=655B8B36,https://www.instagram.com/p/CyiSMQ6NF48/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/392953746_1320094768647414_8413821290826822359_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=BF8RHMWedQ4AX9bgJQb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBSUcHmkjgLLu31zav9d0if5rzB_Ut5I0Yc0Ih48sNFHw&oe=65360A63

A proposta brasileira foi aprovada por 12 delegações entre os 15 países que compõem o órgão mais importante da ONU. Ainda foram registradas duas abstenções. Os EUA, que historicamente blindam questões envolvendo Israel no colegiado, vetou o texto.

instagram,"Continua ad aumentare il bilancio delle vittime del bombardamento dell’ospedale di Gaza. «Oltre 500 morti e altre centinaia di feriti tra i civili che erano in cura o si erano rifugiati nei locali dello Al-Ahli Arab Hospital di Gaza City», fanno sapere i portavoce del ministero della Sanità di Gaza, controllato da Hamas, secondo cui l'esplosione è stata causata da un raid aereo israeliano. Il primo ministro israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu, in un post, ha scritto che «la Jihad islamica è responsabile del fallito lancio di un razzo che ha colpito l’ospedale», ma la Jihad islamica palestinese ha respinto l'accusa: «Il nemico sionista sta facendo del suo meglio per eludere le proprie responsabilità per il brutale massacro attraverso la sua consueta fabbricazione di bugie. Le accuse sono false e infondate». In tutto il Medio Oriente, sono scoppiate le proteste, e la Giordania ha annullato il vertice previsto nella capitale Amman con il presidente degli Stati Uniti Joe Biden e i leader arabi. Unanime la condanna: il presidente egiziano Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, che avrebbe dovuto partecipare al vertice, ha biasimato «nei termini più forti possibili» l’attacco. Anche l'Arabia Saudita ha condannato l'«atroce crimine commesso dalle forze di occupazione israeliane». «Colpire un ospedale che ospita donne, bambini e civili innocenti», ha dichiarato il presidente turco Recep Tayyip Erdogan, «è l'ultimo esempio di attacchi israeliani privi dei valori umani più basilari». Il presidente francese Emmanuel Macron ha affermato che «niente può giustificare un bombardamento contro un ospedale» e che «bisogna far luce sulle circostanze». Biden ha espresso «le più sentite condoglianze per le vite innocenti perse nell'esplosione dell'ospedale di Gaza». L’Oms, intanto, chiede «la protezione immediata dei civili, l’assistenza sanitaria e la revoca degli ordini di evacuazione».

⁠
The sternly worded letter addressed to Lynne Fox, the international president of Workers United, threatens to sue the group should it not immediately stop using the Starbucks name and logo, and it demands the union issue a statement saying that its support of Palestinians over Israel does not reflect the position of Starbucks, which is not affiliated with the union.⁠

""Anger against Starbucks persists because your organization's actions have fueled the inaccurate perception that Starbuck's supports violence against civilians,"" read the letter signed by Rocky Tsai, legal counsel to Starbucks.⁠

Gaza sedang mengalami krisis kemanusiaan yang parah. Tidak ada listrik di wilayah itu. Makanan, bahan bakar, pasokan obat-obatan juga sudah mulai habis.

Israel atribuyó el bombardeo al ""lanzamiento fallido de un cohete"" por parte de la Yihad Islámica, otra organización palestina que opera en la Franja. 

Se trata de la mayor masacre en el enclave en las cinco guerras que se dieron entre las milicias palestinas de Gaza e Israel desde 2008.

instagram,"Il bombardamento dell'ospedale Ah Ahly di Gaza City, avvenuto ieri sera, viene rimbalzato tra Israele e Hamas.

L'attacco, che avrebbe causato almeno 500 vittime, sarebbe stato in un primo tempo reso noto da un esponente del Governo Netanyahu su X (ex Twitter), ma il post è stato successivamente cancellato; nel tweet si parlava in maniera evidente di un attacco contro un ospedale usato come base terroristica.

Israele ha postato più tardi delle foto aeree, grazie alle quali si dovrebbe presumere che ""non ci fossero aerei israeliani sull'ospedale di Gaza"", che quindi, a detta loro, sarebbe stato colpito da Hamas.

Una versione che però cozzerebbe con quanto dichiarato dallo stesso esponente governativo israeliano solo qualche ora prima, che nei successivi tweet ha prima ritrattato , poi cambiato versione, per poi infine scusarsi per ""l'errore"" della sera prima. 

Una situazione a dir poco particolare. La verità come sempre in guerra è merce rara, ma una cosa è certa: centinaia di persone sono morte inutilmente.

Without fact-checking, the media quickly quoted the “Gaza Health Ministry” (aka Hamas), which falsely blamed Israel.

instagram,"¿Contribuirá Joe Biden a apaciguar Oriente Medio? El presidente estadounidense partió este martes a Israel, pero tuvo que renunciar a ir a Jordania después de que un bombardeo a un hospital de Gaza avivara aun más la tensión.

Cuando anunció su viaje el lunes, el mandatario demócrata apostaba por poder presentarse a la vez como garante de la seguridad de Israel en su guerra contra el grupo islamista palestino Hamás y como la mejor esperanza para los civiles, además de como baluarte contra los riesgos de una escalada regional.

Pero la búsqueda de equilibrio que pretendía conseguir con una escala en Tel Aviv seguida de un viaje a Jordania saltó por los aires incluso antes de que se fuera.

Joe Biden, que embarcó en el Air Force One en torno a las 21:40 GMT, anunció que ""pospone"" su viaje a Amán.

De todos modos, Jordania había cancelado la cumbre en la que debía participar junto con el rey Abdalá II, el presidente egipcio, Abdel Fattah al Sisi, y el líder palestino Mahmud Abás.

instagram,"This Tuesday, an Israeli air strike hit the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza city, killing over 500 people, Al Jazeera reported. ""The hospital was one of 20 in the north of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from the Israeli military,"" Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, told Reuters. Earlier this week, the WHO called Israel’s evacuation orders a “death sentence for the sick and injured.”

However, most reports about the bombing say that Israel has denied responsibility for the attack. A clip from CNN showed an anchor stating “IDF said they are looking into the incident, that it could potentially have been a Hamas misfire.” Many users also pointed out the double-standards in reporting about Israel and Gaza: while many are reluctant to name Israel in the incident, the previous day, for instance, BBC News ran a piece speculating whether Hamas built underground tunnels under hospitals in Gaza. The phenomenon shows the changing nature of news in a post-truth age. We intuitively understand what fake news is, amid conversations about its exponential spread over the last decade. But what do we call it when hundreds of children are killed, and there is incomplete and incorrect news about who is responsible?

There is evidence that the Israeli stance regarding the hospital bombing changed over the span of a few hours. Users on X pointed out that Hananya Naftali, an Israeli influencer drafted in the IDF, stated in a now-deleted post that the Israeli Air Force carried out the strike. Fact-checkers showed that Israel’s official X account edited a post that included an unverified video alleging the strikes were from Hamas. Avenues to respond to disinformation are also steadily eroded – through shadowbanning on social media; or death threats to celebrities for challenging the mainstream narrative; or denouncements of media organizations’ credibility, as is evident from Israel’s communications minister seeking a shutdown of Al Jazeera. Further, with Israel having cut off electricity supply to Gaza, there are fewer avenues for reporting the reality of the crisis. Tap the link in bio to read @rohitha_97’s piece.

instagram,"Scores of Palestinians are dead after a blast late yesterday at a hospital in Gaza, a horrific tragedy. 

Hamas immediately blamed Israel. And then so did the paper of record.

Very soon after the incident, The New York Times published a story with the headline “Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say” and sent it out as a breaking news notification. They did so relying on Hamas’s word on the matter. 

Israeli authorities soon after denied responsibility. An IDF spokesperson said that no Israeli aircraft had been operating in the area of the hospital at the time of the explosion. Israel has released footage they say shows that the hospital was struck by a wayward missile fired from within Gaza. The spokesperson further said the Israeli military will release recordings of intercepted conversations and drone footage that they claim demonstrates the hospital was hit by a rocket fired by Gaza-based terrorist group Islamic Jihad. 

Realizing their mistake, editors at the Times changed the headline on their homepage to: “At Least 500 Dead in Strike on Gaza Hospital, Palestinians Say.” 

And then changed it again to: “At Least 500 Dead in Blast at Gaza Hospital, Palestinians Say.” 

So in the space of several hours, it went from an Israeli strike to an ambiguous blast.

We don’t know yet definitively what happened in Gaza yesterday. The point of doing good journalism is that you pause to get the facts straight and hesitate before trusting the word of a terrorist group—in this case, the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health—or a government. Yet, for some reason, when it comes to Hamas, all the old rules are out the window. And whatever the facts are, that breaking news alert—Israel targets a hospital, hundreds of death—is already echoing throughout the world.

Since day 2 of the war, @globalempowermentmission Bstrong and our partner, @smartaidint, have actively working with vital local organizations, including the Kibbutz Movement. Our efforts have been directed towards assisting shelters with crucial aid sourced locally, including beds, pillows, food and more, from various regions across Israel. 
2. Distribution Partners: 
Our trusted NGO partners are on the ground assisting with direct, door-to-door distributions. We are proud to report that we've conducted daily aid deliveries within Israel.  3. Cargo Plane Deliveries: Recently, the first of several cargo planes safely landed in Tel Aviv. These shipments contain critical aid and medical supplies. We have established the necessary infrastructure supply chain and warehouses in Israel through our partner @smartaid to facilitate these efforts.  4. Evacuation Support: GEM is an official partner of the State of Florida, in collaboration with @Governor Ron DeSantis and @FL Department of Emergency Management. We are assisting U.S. citizens and families evacuating from Israel on recurring flight missions to Tampa, Florida. Each evacuee receives a GEM Bstrong Visa card and, if needed, a family necessities kit. GEM has supported 3 planes containing evacuees thus far and will continue to be on the ground in Tampa to provide aid with the State.  5. Partnerships for Aid and Relief: Strong partnerships are vital to GEM’s operations. GEM provided its partner @shulofbalharbour, with 40 donated pallets of aid for their relief efforts in Israel. We are also partnering with @skylake_synagogue to collect humanitarian aid supplies throughout South Florida. Skylake Synagogue donated 100 pallets of aid to this effort. We are actively collecting funds to provide more humanitarian aid in Israel, which can be donated through our website. 
6. Short-Term Cash Assistance: In partnership with the Israeli Business Forum.

instagram,"GUERRA 🚨 O presidente dos EUA, Joe Biden, desembarcou em Israel nesta quarta-feira, 18, e recriminou a explosão em um hospital na Faixa de Gaza que deixou centena de mortos na terça, 17. Do aeroporto, Biden foi direto ao hotel Kempinski em Tel Aviv, onde se reuniu com o primeiro-ministro Benjamin Netanyahu.

Em coletiva, Biden apoiou a versão das autoridades israelenses de que a Jihad Islâmica foi a responsável pelo bombardeio.

”Fiquei profundamente triste e indignado com a explosão em um hospital de Gaza ontem. E, pelo que vi, parece ter sido obra do outro lado”, disse Biden ao primeiro-ministro israelense. “Mas há muitas pessoas por aí que não têm certeza”, continuou.

O grupo terrorista Hamas responsabilizou o governo de Israel pelo episódio e disse que há ao menos 500 mortos no hospital. O número exato de vítimas, porém, ainda não está claro.

Já o Exército israelense disse que o hospital não estava entre os seus alvos e responsabilizou a Jihad Islâmica, outro grupo palestino, que teria lançado mísseis acidentalmente contra o local.

instagram,"EM ISRAEL - O presidente norte-americano, Joe Biden, disse nesta quarta-feira (18) que a explosão do hospital Ahli Arab, em Gaza, parece não ter sido causada por Israel. 

""Segundo o que observei, parece que foi obra do outro lado, não de vocês"", disse Biden ao primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, durante o encontro. Porém, ele destacou que ""há muita gente por aí"" que não tem essa certeza.

Um bombardeio matou centenas de pessoas em um hospital na Faixa de Gaza na terça-feira (17), segundo o Ministério da Saúde local. 

📌 O Hamas disse que partiu de Israel o ataque contra o hospital Ahli Arab. 
📌 As Forças de Defesa israelenses, no entanto, alegaram que a explosão foi causada por um foguete lançado pela Jihad Islâmica, grupo terrorista ligado ao Hamas. 
📌 O grupo, no entanto, negou ser responsável pela ação.

instagram,"Former President Donald Trump has expressed his intention to revoke student visas of ""anti-Semitic foreigners"" if he wins a second term. The war between Israel and Hamas has prompted calls for humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians. Trump stated that he would revoke the student visas of radical anti-American and anti-Semitic foreigners at colleges and universities and send them back home. 

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio has called for President Joe Biden to cancel visas for foreigners who have expressed support for Hamas. Trump and other GOP candidates have also stated that the US will not welcome Palestinian refugees from Gaza into the US if they win in 2024. 

Biden's administration plans to push for Egypt to reopen its border to allow the roughly one million civilians Israel ordered to evacuate Gaza to leave the warzone. Students on US college campuses have been under scrutiny over their responses to the war.

The US said that it did not do enough to underscore Israel’s right to self-defence. The UK abstained for similar reasons.

The US has for decades vetoed dozens of UN resolutions critical of Israel using its position as a permanent member of the Security Council.

instagram,"The Israeli government has accused American model Gigi Hadid of “turning a blind eye” to the events that started a genocide between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, after the 28-year-old posted a message of support for the Palestinian people on social media.

“There is nothing Jewish about the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians,” Hadid, whose father Mohamed Hadid is Palestinian, wrote in a temporary Instagram Story over the weekend to her online following of almost 80 million people.

She added that “condemning the Israeli government is not antisemitic and supporting Palestinians is not supporting Hamas.”

Hadid’s message quickly drew a rebuke from Israel. “There is nothing valiant about Hamas’ massacre of Israelis,” a message on the official Instagram account of the state of Israel said, along with a screenshot of Hadid’s original post.

“Your silence has been very clear about where you stand. We see you,” it added.

instagram,"This image shows a grief-stricken woman with her arms wrapped around the body of a Palestinian child who was killed in an Israeli air strike.

At least 49 Palestinians were killed in strikes that hit homes in Rafah and Khan Younis on Tuesday, Gaza’s interior ministry said.

And in the evening, the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 471 Palestinian were killed in a massive explosion at a crowded hospital in Gaza City. It was the biggest single loss of life in the blockaded territory in all the five wars between Hamas and Israel since the militants took over the strip in 2007.

Officials in Gaza blamed an Israeli airstrike. Israel has denied it was involved and released video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a missile misfire by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. The Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim, and the scale of the blast appeared to be outside the militant groups’ capabilities.

The bombardment on Gaza has continued without relenting since Hamas launched its surprise attack on southern Israel 12 days ago, which killed more than 1,300 Israelis.

During a visit to Tel Aviv today, the US president, Joe Biden, said Hamas “committed evils and atrocities that make Isis somewhat more rational”, and before leaving the country cautioned Israelis not to be consumed by rage, adding that the vast majority of Palestinians were not affiliated with the militant group.

Health authorities in Gaza say at least 3,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its series of retaliatory strikes after 7 October.

instagram,"Nenhuma vida vale mais do que outra e todas as vidas importam, em teoria. Na prática, vivemos em sistemas que criam rankings de valor para a existência. Uma morte a bala de um branco rico nos Jardins ou no Leblon provoca mais comoção do que dezenas de corpos negros no Guarujá ou no Jacarezinho.
A matança terrorista do Hamas provocou mais de 1,4 mil mortes em Israel. A resposta não veio na forma de busca por justiça, mas de aplicação de vingança coletiva com o terror promovido pelo governo de Benjamin Netanyahu. A ação, que se enquadra em crime de guerra contra civis segundo a 4ª Convenção de Genebra, matou mais de 3 mil pessoas com bombas e privou 2,2 milhões de comida, água, remédios e eletricidade.
E por conta do veto dos Estados Unidos à proposta de resolução brasileira no Conselho de Segurança da ONU, nesta quarta (18), que previa o fim dos bombardeios e a entrada de ajuda humanitária, os números vão continua escalando. 
O sofrimento pela morte de um único ente querido é imensurável, então não é possível dizer que a dor de um lado é maior que a de outro. Mas a contagem de corpos impõe uma medida objetiva que demonstra a assimetria entre os envolvidos e precisa ser levada em conta. 
A terrível execução de 260 pessoas em uma rave em Israel pelas mãos do Hamas não dá sinais de que irá se repetir. Por outro lado, o massacre de mais 500 pessoas no hospital de Al-Ahly Arab, em Gaza, pode se repetir caso não haja um cessar-fogo.
Qual o patamar de mortos que fará com que o Ocidente passe a encarar o que está acontecendo em Gaza como uma matança da mesma forma que já encarou como matança o que foi perpetrado pelo Hamas em Israel? Ou seja, a partir de quando o ""direito de defesa"" se transforma em ""crime contra a humanidade""? Qual o patamar para o ""agora deu""? Mais de 5 mil? 10 mil? 50 mil corpos palestinos? Existe tal patamar ou o racismo e o cálculo geopolítico atropela tudo?
Nesse sentido, o Conselho de Segurança da ONU poderia, pelo menos, ter a dignidade de criar o Fundo das Nações Unidas para Enterros de Vítimas de Conflitos. Porque o cheiro dos corpos em decomposição no Norte de Gaza, como me contaram médicos que atuam na área, já impregna o ar.",,5604,"{'like_count': 5427, 'comment_count': 177, 'num_users': 180378}",Leonardo Sakamoto,,2023-10-18 15:28:54,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/251865879_594987411622801_7003052263680591289_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=ZAYVDIpSYmEAX--80Jq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfBe_OpM0C848tL8s7g9Y39lwFOtV2gxvSIZHxLxpInc6A&oe=655B384E,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyi5Kx-uPzA/,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/393431668_279593961707037_7682961384807446817_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c4dd86&_nc_ohc=9nvSkJ1e_x8AX9hH1hD&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=00_AfAWO3QOxwQKOs8pGj52TOvJiiaXXzZp2-898UJYJLeFTQ&oe=654956CB

instagram,"New York Times: 
SHAME ON YOU. 

Yesterday, at 6:59PM Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of around 10 rockets.
One of the rockets misfired (fairly common event) and hit the parking lot of a hospital, killing many innocent people. 

Hamas immediately understood that this was the Islamic Jihad’s rocket, and launched a massive lie campaign, blaming Israel. 

The NYT immediately adopted Hamas’ version, peddling this lie for hours. 

We now know the facts, cross-checked from four different sources. 

Yes, it took time, because serious investigations take time.

🗣️ “Certa vez, numa viagem pela África, o ex-secretário-geral da ONU, Ban Ki Moon, me confessou que seus discursos eram ‘água com água’. E que cada vez que ele tentava botar sal ou pimenta, uma mão vinha e dava um ‘tapa’ em suas intenções”, conta o colunista.

Visto mais de 4 milhões de vezes, o post traz apenas a frase “Seu tempo acabou”, mas escrito em hebraico, o que foi interpretado como uma provocação direta a Israel. A frase também se transformou em grito de guerra de manifestantes islâmicos hoje, que foram às ruas protestar contra a destruição de um hospital na Faixa de Gaza por um míssil, que supostamente teria sido disparado por Israel.

instagram,"O governo do Irã usou uma mensagem enigmática na noite desta terça-feira (17) para indicar que países árabes e muçulmanos podem atacar Israel transformando a guerra da nação hebraica contra os terroristas do grupo Hamas em um conflito de grandes proporções. Visto mais de 4 milhões de vezes, o post traz apenas a frase “Seu tempo acabou”, mas escrito em hebraico, o que foi interpretado como uma provocação direta a Israel. A frase também se transformou em grito de guerra de manifestantes islâmicos hoje, que foram às ruas protestar contra a destruição de um hospital na Faixa de Gaza por um míssil, que supostamente teria sido disparado por Israel.

instagram,"""Membela hak asasi manusia Palestina tidak berarti Anda pro-Hamas.""

""Mengatakan ""Bebaskan Palestina"" tidak berarti Anda anti-Semit atau ""ingin semua orang Yahudi lenyap"".

“Bebaskan Palestina” berarti membebaskan warga Palestina dari pendudukan Israel yang telah merampas hak asasi mereka selama 75 tahun.

“Bebaskan Palestina” berarti berhenti mengurung 2,3 juta warga Palestina di penjara terbuka terbesar di dunia, yang setengahnya adalah anak-anak.

“Bebaskan Palestina” berarti mengakhiri apartheid yang diberlakukan oleh pemerintah Israel.

“Bebaskan Palestina” artinya memberi rakyat Palestina kendali atas infrastruktur dasar di tanah mereka.

instagram,"VETADO - O Conselho de Segurança da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) rejeitou, nesta quarta (18), a proposta apresentada pelo Brasil. Os Estados Unidos vetaram a resolução feita pelo governo de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) sobre a guerra entre Israel e o grupo extremista Hamas. O grupo composto por representantes de 16 países está reunido nos Estados Unidos para tratar sobre o tema. 

A proposta brasileira citava, entre outros pontos, “os ataques terroristas atrozes do Hamas que ocorreram em Israel a partir de 7 de outubro de 2023 e a tomada de reféns civis”. Além disso, incentivava ""o estabelecimento de corredores humanitários e outras iniciativas para a entrega de ajuda humanitária a civis"". 

No conselho, 12 países foram favoráveis à resolução, como China e França. Rússia e Reino Unido se abstiveram, enquanto os Estados Unidos votaram contra. Como os EUA são um membro permanente do colegiado, o país possui poder de veto sobre qualquer decisão, o que impediu que o projeto do governo brasileiro fosse para frente.

Oktober stürmte die Hamas den Kibbuz Kisufim in der Nähe des Gazastreifens, richtete dort ein Blutbad an. Die Terroristen zerrten Smiatich aus dem Sicherheitsraum ihres Hauses. Sie brachten sie in ihr Wohnzimmer. Dort ermordeten die Hamas-Terroristen die alte Dame mit einem Kopfschuss.

Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, as well as Arab leaders blame the attack on Israel’s Defense Forces which have been relentlessly bombing Gaza daily since the Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed some 1,300 people. Israel blames Hamas and its affiliate group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, saying the hospital blast was caused by a failed rocket launch.

instagram,"💔 HEARTBREAKING: The burned bodies of an Israeli mother and a child have been found in one of the Gaza border settlements by Zaka volunteers who work there as part of cleaning up the scenes of Hamas's October 7 massacre.

Upon entering one of the houses, the charred body of a woman was discovered, and in the attic, they identified the body of a minor, apparently after he fled there trying to escape the terrorists.

The bodies are now being collected and will later be transferred for police and army inspection to the medical laboratories. - JPost

instagram,"The US has used its veto at the UN security council to block a resolution calling for Israel to allow humanitarian corridors into the Gaza Strip, a pause in the fighting and the lifting of an order for civilians to leave the north of the besieged territory.

The text – supported by 12 of the 15 members of the security council on Wednesday – contained criticism of “heinous terrorist crimes by Hamas” and made no direct reference of Israel. In an attempt to win US support, the draft resolution did not explicitly call for a ceasefire, instead referencing a “humanitarian pause”.

But the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the resolution, carefully crafted by Brazilian diplomats, was unacceptable because it made no mention of Israel’s right to self-defence. The UK abstained, saying the resolution lacked mention of the way Hamas was using ordinary Palestinians as human shields.

The US ambassador said she was horrified and saddened by the loss of life, but that the actions of Hamas had brought about the humanitarian crisis. She also called for time to let Joe Biden’s diplomacy play out.

Israel thanked the US for using its veto. China described the move as “nothing short of unbelievable” while Russia said it was an example of US double standards.

Two members of the G7 on the council – Japan and France – broke with the US by backing the motion.

The draft resolution also called for “humanitarian pauses to allow full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access for United Nations humanitarian agencies”. Its failure to pass represented another blow to the authority of the world body.

instagram,"High school students in San Francisco plan to walk out of classrooms Wednesday to protest Israel bombing Gaza and demand a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, organizers said.

The walkout comes a day after an airstrike destroyed a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, killing hundreds of Palestinians and others sheltering there. Hamas and Israel have blamed each other for the bombing.

High school students have called for nationwide walkouts to “protest the ongoing killing of Palestinians in Gaza by the Israeli military and to demand an immediate ceasefire,” the Arab Resource & Organizing Center, the group that organized the event, said in a statement.

instagram,"👉 Face à la montée des violences en Palestine, la mannequin Gigi Hadid a exposé son point de vue nuancé sur son compte Instagram suivi par près de 80 millions de personnes, le 10 octobre 2023.

Quelques heures avant ce message de commémoration des victimes palestiniennes et israéliennes, Gigi Hadid avait partagé en story éphémère une publication (du compte @consent.wizardry) qui stipulait :

« Il n’y a rien de juif dans le traitement réservé aux Palestiniens par le gouvernement israélien. Condamner le gouvernement israélien n’est pas antisémite et soutenir les Palestiniens n’est pas soutenir le Hamas » 📢

Depuis, cette déclaration éphémère émanant du compte Instagram certifié de l’État d’Israël, la mannequin, ainsi que sa famille (sa sœur Bella, leur frère Anwar, leur mère Yolanda qui est Hollandaise, et leur père Mohamed qui est Palestinien) reçoivent de nombreuses menaces de mort anonymes, rapporte le média TMZ. 

📌 Habituellement très vocale sur l’occupation de la Palestine, Bella Hadid n’a pas publiquement réagi pour l’heure. Vu la façon dont chaque prise de position de personnalités publiques polarise, voire suscite de violentes réactions, on peut comprendre pourquoi.

O voo também transporta 40 purificadores de água, além de kits de medicamentos e insumos para ajuda humanitária à população da região. Os purificadores têm capacidade de tratar mais de 220 mil litros por dia

Com tecnologia e fabricação brasileiras, o purificador é portátil e capaz de remover 100% de vírus e bactérias da água. Depois de desembarcar os kits humanitários em Al-Arish, o avião segue para a cidade do Cairo e aguarda para repatriar o grupo de cerca de 30 brasileiros e familiares diretos que estão em Gaza e espera autorização internacional para cruzar a passagem de Rafah, na fronteira com o Egito

Hagari assegura ainda que foi intercetada uma chamada entre elementos do Hamas em que estariam a falar de “rockets falhados” e que foi este grupo o responsável pelo ataque.

instagram,"Așa arăta orașul înainte ca blocada Israelului să distrugă Gaza și înainte ca Hamas să ajungă la putere.

În 1940, fotograful Kegham Djeghalian, din Ierusalim, care fugise și el din Armenia în timpul genocidului, s-a mutat în Gaza, care era pe atunci un oraș palestinian de pe coasta mediterană. 80 de ani și numeroase războaie mai târziu, Gaza a devenit unul dintre orașele cele mai neprimitoare de pe planetă. Majoritatea locuitorilor sunt șomeri și au acces limitat la apă, electricitate, mâncare și medicamente. În plus, bineînțeles, nici nu pot pleca de acolo.

Nepotul lui în vârstă de 36 de ani, Kegham Djeghalian Jr, director artistic, artist vizual și stilist de modă stabilit în Franța, a găsit de curând niște cutii cu negative și fotografii vechi de-ale bunicului lui, acasă la tatăl lui, în Egipt.

Fotografiile prezintă o dimensiune rară a vieților locuitorilor din Gaza între 1940 și 1970, pe când toți erau lipsiți de griji. Datele de pe fotografii au fost șterse, pentru „o reprezentare a Fâșiei Gaza suspendată în timp”, așa cum spune Kegham junior.

„Nu l-am cunoscut niciodată pe bunicul meu. A trăit în Gaza și a murit acolo, la începutul anilor 1980. Pe lângă pasiunea noastră comună pentru arte vizuale, mi-aș fi dorit să-l cunosc și pentru cum reacționează oamenii când le spun că sunt nepotul lui. A înființat primul studio de fotografie din oraș și oamenii au reacții emoționale puternice atunci când îi aud numele.

Tata nu mi-a zis niciodată despre cutiile cu fotografii, uitase de ele. Descoperirea lor mi-a schimbat viața – am devenit mai conștient de moștenirea familiei mele și am început să-mi înțeleg identitatea mai bine.

instagram,"The Russian-led draft resolution received five votes in favour (China, Gabon, Mozambique, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates) and four against (France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), with six abstentions (Albania, Brazil, Ecuador, Ghana, Malta, and Switzerland).

Members were split over the lack of a particular condemnation of the extremist group Hamas, which on October 7 sent hundreds of fighters to commit massacres in settlements close to the Gaza Strip and started the current upsurge in violence.

For the Council to adopt a resolution, the proposal must receive at least nine votes in favour, with none of its five permanent members opposing or casting a veto. The draft text called for a humanitarian ceasefire, the release of all hostages, aid access, and the safe evacuation of civilians.

The Council will be considering a different draft resolution from Brazil on Tuesday. According to news reports, it calls for humanitarian pauses as well as the issuing of condemnations of Hamas and all terrorist acts against civilians.

Videos show pickup trucks carrying Hamas militants driving through the city, targeting several vehicles on their way. In the videos, two people were seen running from their vehicles after they encountered the militants entering the city.

Israeli forces have carried out their fiercest bombardment of Gaza in response, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians.

On October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israeli civilians in southern towns and communities bordering the Gaza Strip, in what was the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Israel quickly declared war against the Gaza-based terrorist organization. With wars between Hamas and Israel breaking out every few years, one has to wonder...what is Hamas and how did it arise as the sole power governing Gaza today?

About Explainers: From ancient Jewish traditions to the modern State of Israel, we explain it all. Diving into anything and everything related to Jewish culture, history, and even religion. 
Understand Jewish holidays, Israeli politics, Jewish diasporic communities, and more. Learn about Judaism in pop culture, debunking myths about Jews, and explore obscure Israeli landmarks.  We’re asking questions as basic as “What is the Talmud?”, and as obscure as “How did hip-hop boost Kosher wine sales?”, and everything in between.

About Unpacked: We provide nuanced insights by unpacking all things Jewish. People are complex and complicated — yet we’re constantly being pushed to oversimplify our world. At Unpacked we know that being complex makes us more interesting. Because of this, we break the world down with nuance and insight to drive your curiosity and challenge your thinking.

youtube,"In the realm of military technology, the matchup between the Al-Yasin anti-tank missile and the formidable Merkava tank presents a compelling study in the balance of power and innovation. The Al-Yasin, a creation of Hamas, is a relatively small and non-stealthy projectile, while the Merkava tank, an Israeli-made heavy armored vehicle, is renowned for its robust defenses. The comparison between these two highlights the intricate dynamics of modern warfare, where ingenuity and tactical precision can often tip the scales in unexpected ways. Let’s check out whether the AL-Yasin can destroy the Israeli Merkava Tank.

In an audio clip procured by Israeli military intelligence, two alleged Hamas terrorists can be heard discussing the explosion. The two alleged Hamas terrorists can be heard confirming the rocket came from Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) - an independent jihadist group. Over the years, Hamas gained some political legitimacy, while Islamic Jihad remained primarily focused on armed attacks. There have been times when the PIJ has taken the front seat while Hamas remained on the sidelines during clashes with Israel.

youtube,"Dashcam video released on Thursday (October 19) showed heavily armed Hamas fighters firing at people at the site of the Nature Party music festival, which was among the first targets of the militiants' surprise attack on October 7.

Hamas fighters could be seen aiming their weapons to the left of site (not appearing on camera) and shooting at fleeing festival goers, urging each other to save ammunition.

The location of the videos was verified by road signs and road layouts which matched verified drone footage filmed at the same location and satellite imagery. The same cars are also visible in the verified drone footage showing aftermath of the site.

Thousands attended the trance music festival near Kibbutz Re'im close to Gaza from which Hamas launched its attack, killing 260 people and taking dozens hostage.

Ariel Zohar, dressed in all black and flanked by members of his extended family, sobbed while looking in horrified disbelief at the shroud-wrapped bodies of his dad, Yaniv Zohar, 54, his mother, Yasmin, 49, and his two sisters, Tehelet, 20, and Keshet, 18, at their joint funeral service in the city of Rishon LeTsiyon Tuesday.

Four members of the Zohar family were killed along with Ariel’s maternal grandfather, Haim Livne, at their home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, located near the Gaza border, on the morning of October 7.

The boy survived the attack only because he was out jogging at the time. He later sheltered at a nearby house and escaped unharmed.

An estimated 1,000 mourners attended the emotional funeral service for the Zohar family, which was interrupted four times by air-raid sirens and incoming rocket fire from Gaza.

youtube,"#israel #gaza #rockets 

Disclaimer: This content is intended solely for educational and entertainment purposes, and it does not depict the actual process of rocket production.

How did they manage to create a rocket at home?

First of all they use some common household ingredients, such as sugar and potassium nitrate, which can be easily obtained as a fertilizer.

Then they Start by melting the sugar, mix in the fertilizer, and pour the resulting mixture into a mold to form a properly-sized propellant slug.
This propellant is subsequently placed into a Round Tube, which serves as the rocket's body, typically made from locally available water pipes.

You might wonder why sugar is included in the mix.

Sugar contains a substantial amount of energy, but it releases this energy slowly when it burns, and The fertilizer serves as an oxidizing agent, supplying oxygen.

This allows for a much quicker release of energy.
When the right proportions are used, it burns fast enough to propel a rocket, yet not so quickly as to cause an explosion.

Haniyeh added that the attack confirmed Israel’s “brutality” and the extent of its “defeat” after Hamas’s attack on October 7.
He also called for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to rise up against the Israeli occupation – just as thousands take to the streets in Ramallah.

On Monday, a top Hamas leader said the group ""has what it needs"" to free all Palestinians in Israel's jails, indicating the terrorist group may try to use the Israelis it kidnapped as bargaining chips to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.

After giving his response on Bassem Youssef's criticism of Ben Shapiro's stance on the war earlier, Jeremy delves more into the unfortunate shift in the outlook across the world on Jewish people by dehumanising them.

Grace and Hilary then get into a debate on the rationale of the Israeli forces and their response to Hamas’s attack on October 7th. Grace believes that Israel has committed multiple war crimes by bombing and targeting civilian buildings as well as using white phosphorus gas.

Hilary suggests that Israel should not be blamed for what Hamas has created. Grace fires back suggesting Palestinian people shouldn't suffer for what Hamas did.

youtube,"Piers Morgan Uncensored is joined by Palestinian Ambassador Husam Zomlot for a passionate debate on the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel, Palestine and terrorist organisation Hamas. They also discuss the conflicting reports of the missile that went into a civilian hospital in Gaza.

Piers asks Husam if he will condemn Hamas attacks on October 7th on Israeli citizens. Husam doesn't condemn the attacks, but rejects the notion of killing innocent civilians. Husam adds that if he condemns the attacks, people will cling on to the idea that Hamas are the people who started this conflict and believes it is dangerous because people conflate Hamas with the Palestinian public.

The ambassador then goes on to question Piers on why he did not ask the Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotovely to condemn the actions of the Israeli government before asking whether he would accept that by the definition of terrorism, Israel's actions should be defined the same way.

Sergio Saracco, Miembro de la Asociación de Toxicología en Argentina dialogó en DNews con Estefania Meira-Serantes luego de que hayan encontrado captagon en cuerpos de terroristas de Hamás. 

¿Qué es el Captagon?
El captagón, llamado así por una de sus marcas, y también conocido como ""la cocaína  de los pobres"", se ha convertido en la droga preferida de los jóvenes adultos de Oriente Próximo y el Norte de África. El medicamento Captagon se declaró ilegal en 1986 en la mayoría de los países y se dejó de comercializar con fines médicos.
Los informes también sugieren que los combatientes en el conflicto sirio suelen usar la droga para aumentar el rendimiento en combate y reducir la fatiga. La píldora contiene fenetilina, una anfetamina sintética, cafeína y otros estimulantes. El organismo metaboliza la fenetilina en dos moléculas: anfetamina y teofilina, ambas estimulantes.

youtube,"TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Korea Utara diklaim telah ikut berpartisipasi dalam serangan mendadak Hamas ke Israel pada (7/10) lalu.

Selain itu, negara pimpinan Kim Jong Un juga disebut menggelar pelatihan militer untuk Hamas sebelum melancarkan aksi tersebut.

Hal ini disampaikan oleh militer Korea Selatan dalam menyampaikan evaluasi sementara mengenai perang yang berlangsung antara Israel dan Hamas pada Selasa (17/10).

Mereka menilai bahwa hubungan langsung dan tak langsung antara Hamas dan Korut yang mencakup berbagai aspek.

Di antaranya perdagangan senjata, taktik, doktrin dan pelatihan.

“Penilaian kami terhadap situasi ini telah mengungkap hubungan langsung dan tidak langsung antara Hamas dan Korea Utara, yang mencakup berbagai aspek termasuk perdagangan senjata, taktik, doktrin dan pelatihan,” kata JCS dalam evaluasinya.

Militer Korsel itu juga menyimpulkan bahwa Korut ikut andil pada Hamas dalam mempersiapkan serangan skala besar dengan menggunakan taktik yang berbeda dari sebelumnya.

Hal itu terlihat dari taktik yang digunakan Hamas dalam menyerang Israel.

Di mana cara berperang itu dianggap mirip dengan yang digunakan oleh Korut.

Hamas sebelumnya menggunakan taktik yang berpusat pada serangan tabrak lari, dan terlibat dalam konflik skala kecil dan serangan roket.

Namun, selama akhir pekan lalu, Hamas melancarkan serangan tak terduga.

Militan Palestin itu meluncurkan sejumlah besar roket untuk mengalahkan sistem pertahanan rudal Iron Dome Israel. 

Sebelumnya, Korut juga disebut mengirim senjata ke Hamas untuk melawan Israel.

Diduga senjata-senjata milik Korut sudah berada di Iran dalam waktu yang lama.

Namun kabar ini sempat dibantah oleh Korea Utara.

youtube,"TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Pemimpin kelompok Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh belakangan tengah menjadi perbincangan seusai serangan mendadak Hamas berhasil membombardir Israel pada, Sabtu (7/10/2023).

Berlangsungnya serangan Hamas itu tidak lepas dari peran sang pemimpin, Ismail Haniyeh.

Berkat sponsor Doha dan kekayaan yang ia kumpulkan sebagai pemimpin Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh dan anak-anaknya kini hidup dalam kekayaan dan hak istimewa yang tidak dimiliki warga Gaza lainnya.

Tak lama setelah diluncurkannya serangan brutal Hamas terhadap Israel pada tanggal 7 Oktober, sebuah video beredar yang memperlihatkan pemimpin kelompok teror Ismail Haniyeh di kantornya yang  di ibu kota Qatar, Doha.

Mereka menyaksikan serangan berdarah yang terjadi di Al Jazeera dan “sujud syukur” dengan sekelompok pejabat Hamas lainnya atas pembunuhan lebih dari 1.300 warga Israel, di antaranya sedikitnya 1.000 warga sipil.

Selama bertahun-tahun, Haniyeh telah ditegur oleh banyak warga Palestina karena menjalani kehidupan yang nyaman jauh dari kesulitan di Gaza.

Mereka berada di negara monarki Teluk yang kaya minyak, yang menawarkan perlindungan bagi para pemimpin kelompok teror dan platform yang diakui secara internasional untuk menyebarkan propaganda mereka melalui Al Jazeera.

Sebelum kemenangan Hamas dalam pemilu Palestina melawan Fatah pada tahun 2006, Haniyeh bukanlah anggota terkemuka dari kepemimpinan kelompok teror tersebut. 

Setelah kemenangan elektoral, kariernya mulai menanjak.

Selama bertahun-tahun, Haniyeh telah ditegur oleh banyak warga Palestina karena menjalani kehidupan yang nyaman jauh dari kesulitan di Gaza di negara monarki Teluk yang kaya minyak, yang menawarkan perlindungan bagi para pemimpin kelompok teror dan platform yang diakui secara internasional untuk menyebarkan propaganda mereka melalui Al Jazeera.

Sebelum kemenangan Hamas dalam pemilu Palestina melawan Fatah pada tahun 2006, Haniyeh bukanlah anggota terkemuka dari kepemimpinan kelompok teror tersebut. Setelah kemenangan elektoral, bintangnya mulai menanjak.

Dia ditunjuk sebagai perdana menteri Otoritas Palestina di Jalur Gaza.

Kekayaannya tumbuh pesat berkat kontrol yang ia dan menteri-menteri lain di pemerintahan Hamas lakukan terhadap perekonomian Gaza dan pajak yang mereka kenakan atas barang-barang yang diimpor ke Jalur Gaza dari Mesir.

Tokoh senior Hamas, termasuk Haniyeh, akan mengenakan pajak sebesar 20 persen untuk semua perdagangan yang melewati terowongan tersebut, menurut laporan tahun 2014 di Ynet, sebuah situs berita Israel.

Pada tahun 2010, Haniyeh menghabiskan $4 juta untuk membeli sebidang tanah di tepi pantai Gaza dekat kamp pengungsi Shati tempat ia dibesarkan, yang ia daftarkan atas nama menantunya, menurut majalah Mesir Rose al-Yusuf.

Sejak itu, Haniyeh telah membeli beberapa apartemen, vila, dan bangunan di Jalur Gaza, atas nama 13 anaknya.

Kekayaannya sangat kontras dengan kemiskinan endemik di Jalur Gaza, di mana separuh penduduknya menganggur, dan PDB per kapita sekitar $5.600 per tahun pada tahun 2021, menjadikannya salah satu tempat termiskin di dunia.

Beberapa ahli menyalahkan pertumbuhan ekonomi yang terhambat akibat blokade Israel-Mesir yang berlaku sejak tahun 2007, yang telah memberlakukan pembatasan terhadap barang-barang yang masuk atau keluar dari Jalur Gaza.

On Monday, a top Hamas leader said the group ""has what it needs"" to free all Palestinians in Israel's jails, indicating the terrorist group may try to use the Israelis it kidnapped as bargaining chips to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.

youtube,"TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Israel memprediksi Presiden Rusia Vladimir Putin bekerja sama dengan Iran untuk memperkuat militan Hamas. 

Bahkan Israel menuduh Putin mengirim senjata ke Hamas yang diselundupkan dari Iran.

Dikutip dari Maariv, tuduhan itu disampaikan oleh politisi Israel, Ze'ev Elkin pada Rabu (18/10). 

Pihaknya mengaku telah memperingatkan sejak lama bahwa Rusia telah mengubah aturan mainnya. 

Rusia disebut menciptakan aliansi strategis dengan Iran dalam dunia perang. 

Elkin menyebut Iran telah membantu Rusia menginvasi Ukraina. 

Gini giliran Rusia yang membantu Iran dalam bentuk lain. 

Politisi Israel itu menyebut Rusia mengirim senjata ke Iran yang kemungkinan digunakan pasukan Hamas dalam serangannya ke Israel. 

 ""Saya telah memperingatkan sejak lama bahwa kita perlu menyadari bahwa Rusia telah mengubah aturan mainnya. Rusia telah menciptakan aliansi strategis dengan Iran seputar perang di Ukraina, dan sama seperti Iran membantu Rusia di sana. 

Kemudian, Elkin juga menyoroti pernyataan Putin terhadap perang Hamas dan Israel. 

Pihaknya menyebut Putin kerap membandingkan apa yang terjadi di Gaza dengan Perang Dunia Kedua. 

Tak hanya itu, Elkin membeberkan informasi tentang keterlibatan Rusia dalam serangan mematikan yang dilakukan Hamas. 

Ia menyebut bahwa beebrapa senjata Hamas berasal dari Rusia, meski pun ia tidak bisa mengonfirmasinya. 

Namun ia meyakini senjata Rusia baik secara sengaja atau tidak digunakan militan Hamas menyerang Israel. 

Pasalnya, militan Hamas dilatih oleh Hizbullan dan Iran yang bekerja sama hingga mempunyai hubungan erat dengan Rusia. 

""Saya pikir mereka tahu bahwa beberapa senjata yang ada di sana aslinya berasal dari Rusia, saya tidak yakin apakah mereka tahu persis bagaimana senjata itu didapat. di sana, secara sengaja atau tidak sengaja, atau melalui segala macam perantara, tapi Kita tahu bahwa para teroris Hamas ini dilatih di Suriah dan Lebanon oleh Hizbullah dan Iran, dan jelas bahwa ada kerja sama yang sangat erat antara Rusia dan Iran di Suriah. ."" kata Elkin.

youtube,"TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Pemerintahan Presiden AS Joe Biden diam-diam mendesak Israel untuk tidak melancarkan serangan ke Hizbullah pasukan dari Lebanon.

Hizbullah pun dianggap merupakan pasukan kuat bahkan diklaim memiliki kemampuan sepuluk kali dari Hamas.

Hal itu diungkapkan oleh pejabat Israel pada Kamis (19/10).

“AS mengakui bahwa Israel harus menanggapi peningkatan sasaran Hizbullah di perbatasan utaranya sejak serangan Hamas pada 7 Oktober,” kata dua pejabat Israel yang mengetahui masalah tersebut kepada Times of Israel.

Mereka mengatakan bahwa As memperingatkan Israel untuk berhati-hati dalam menanggapi serangan Hizbullah.

Sebab, jika pasukan Israel melakukan kesalahan maka hal itu dapat memicu perang yang lebih besar.

Para pejabat Biden telah mengindikasikan kepada Israel jika Hizbullah mulai perang melawan Israel maka militer AS akan bergabung dengan IDF untuk memerangi kelompok tersebut.

Sementara itu, Juru bicara Gedung Putih John Kirby mengaku kekuatan dari pasukan Lebanon itu tidak perlu diragukan lagi.

Kini Hizbullah sedang dalam pengawasan Israel maupun AS.

Sebelumnya, Menteri Pertahanan Israel Yoav Gallant mengakui ahwa Hizbullah lebih kuat 10 kali dari Hamas. 

Pernyataan tersebut disampaikan Gallant dalam sesi diskusi tertutup dengan pejabat senior pemerintah Israel.

Dalam diskusi itu, ia meminta para pejabat senior pemerintah untuk bergerak menyelesaikan transfer persediaan dan perlengkapan militer kepada tentara. 

Sementara analisis militer Israel, Jenderal Yigal Carmon menyebut kekuatan Hizbullah dinilai timpang dengan kondisi militer Israel. 

Ia menekankan bahwa tentara Israel tidak terlatih.

youtube,"PLO | Tình hình xung đột Israel- Hamas vẫn đang tiếp tục leo thang. Bộ Y tế Palestine cho biết tính từ ngày 7-10, xung đột Israel - Hamas đã khiến 2.808 người Palestine thiệt mạng và 10.859 người bị thương. Trong khi đó, Israel nói rằng theo thống kê mới nhất, số người Israel thiệt mạng do cuộc tấn công rocket và xâm nhập bất ngờ của Hamas hôm 7-10 là hơn 1.400 người và khoảng 3.500 người bị thương.
Theo đó, Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Israel Yoav Gallant đã cảnh báo “một cuộc chiến lâu dài” với nhóm Hamas đang ở phía trước. Ở phía ngược lại Hamas cũng cho biết tất cả đã ‘sẵn sàng’ chờ ngày Israel tấn công dải Gaza trên đường bộ và tỏ rõ thái độ không sợ hãi trước việc xung đột Israel - Hamas có thể kéo dài. 
Đáng chú ý, trong ngày 17-10 cũng là ngày thứ 11 của cuộc xung đột Israel - Hamas, những diễn biến từ phía Bắc Israel làm lớn thêm lo ngại Trung Đông sẽ chìm vào biển lửa khi nhóm vũ trang Hezbollah ở Lebanon tiếp diễn với hàng loạt vụ nã súng cối và pháo kích vào Israel. 
Nhiều chuyên gia quân sự đánh giá, dường như Israel đang ở thế gọng kìm khi Hamas tấn công phía Nam và Hezbollah đe dọa phía Bắc.

youtube,"TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Presiden Amerika Serikat Joe Biden blak-blakan bakal menjamin kemerdekaan Palestina.

Hal itu diutarakan Biden di tengah konflik Israel Palestina yang semakin memanas.

Menurut Joe Biden, pendudukan Israel di Gaza akan menjadi kesalahan besar.

Dikutip dari Wartakotalive, pernyataan itu disampaikan Biden pada Senin (16/10/2023).

Biden berpendapat bahwa Hamas tak mewakili seluruh masyarakat Palestina.

Sehingga menurutnya, kesalahan besar bila Israel menduduki wilayah Gaza.

Meski begitu, Biden tetap membela Israel.

Bahkan, ia menyebut bahwa negara Zionis itu akan mematuhi hukum internasional dalam memberantas Hamas dan Hizbullah.

Di sisi lain, Biden menegaskan bahwa Amerika Serikat membuka opsi dua negara untuk konflik yang kian panas itu.

Presiden Amerika Serikat itu juga menjamin kemerdekaan untuk Palestina.

Namun, Joe Biden berdalih Hamas harus dimusnahkan terlebih dahulu.

“Ini akan menciptakan negara merdeka di samping Israel untuk 5 juta warga Palestina,"" janjinya.

Pihak Israel menyebut, serangan itu berasal dari roket yang salah sasaran yang diluncurkan oleh teroris Gaza. 

Warga Palestina dan sebagian besar negara-negara Arab menyalahkan Israel. 

Intelijen mengatakan, Jihad Islam bertanggung jawab atas kegagalan peluncuran roket dan menghantam rumah sakit di Gaza. 

Untuk memperkuat pernyataan tersebut, Israel membocorkan percakapan terkait serangan yang berhasil disadap. 

Percakapan telepon yang disadap tersebut diunggah oleh IDF melalui media sosial X.

Berkat sponsor Doha dan kekayaan yang ia kumpulkan sebagai pemimpin Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh dan anak-anaknya kini hidup dalam kekayaan dan hak istimewa yang tidak dimiliki warga Gaza lainnya.

The horrifying sounds and visuals of the surprise and audacious attack on Israel by Hamas in the early hours of October 7th, 2023, are still echoing as Israeli forces take back control of the situation across the Gaza Strip. The attack by Hamas launched across land, air, and sea, was planned and executed with precision and timed for the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. As of this time, well over a thousand Israelis have been killed, including infants, women, and the elderly. Israeli forces have launched a ferocious air and artillery assault on Gaza, targeting key military and command positions of Hamas. The ground troops regained control over the breached crossings and were able to neutralize most of the Hamas infiltrators.With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowing mighty revenge, Israel has mobilized nearly 400000 of its reserves. Also, it's moving tanks, artillery, and troops to the border with Gaza in preparation for a ground offensive. A broad comparison between the military might of Israel and Hamas quickly reveals that it's a war of two unequal forces. Israel has a well-organized, structured, and equipped modern military, while Hamas has fighters who have been mustered, indoctrinated, equipped, and trained as any other terrorist organization in basic combat, guerilla warfare, suicide attacks, etc.

youtube,"HAMAS - What you need to know in 10 minutes

Hamas is an Islamist militant movement and one of the Palestinian territories’ two major political parties. It governs more than two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, but the group is best known for its armed resistance to Israel. Its history is filled with both controversy and complexity, and it has played a pivotal role in shaping the region's destiny. Join us as we explore the history of the group and what led them to where they are today. Many nations have classified Hamas as a terrorist group, although in certain cases, this designation is limited to its military faction. Iran offers both material and financial backing to the organization, and it's been reported that some of its senior figures find refuge in Turkey.
In contrast, Fatah, a rival Palestinian party that wields authority within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and governs the West Bank, has formally rejected the use of violence. The persistent rift in Palestinian leadership and Hamas's enduring antagonism towards Israel have eroded the potential for stability in Gaza.

In today's video we look at HAMAS - What you need to know in 10 minutes… hamas, and the israel hamas war, and the history, and the hamas group, and the israel hamas, and the israel palestine conflict history, and the history of israel explained, and the hamas attack israel, and the hamas israel, and the hamas's control over gaza, and the soas university of london, and the palestine history, and the palestinian militant group, and the hamas news, and the israel palestine history, and the hamas attack, and the hamas militants infiltrate israel, and the gaza strip history, and the hamas strike israel, and the israel and palestine history, and the hamas strikes israel, and the hamas launch strikes on israel.

“Let me be clear,” he said. “If Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, it will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people. And it will end, as a practical matter. I will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.”

youtube,"On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, and kidnapping over 240 children, women and men into Gaza.

Hamas terrorists targeted Israelis and Jews, but Israelis and Jews were far from the only victims. Those killed also included Muslims, Arabs, Bedouin, Druze and individuals of 40 different nationalities. The hostages are comprised of citizens from Israel, Argentina, China, France, Germany, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, the United States and other countries.

In the aftermath of October 7th, there has been a shocking increase in antisemitism in the U.S. and around the world. Stay informed and take action.

youtube,"The Israel-Hamas conflict refers to the ongoing conflict between Israel, a Middle Eastern country, and Hamas, an Islamist Palestinian organization based in the Gaza Strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is the military force of Israel, responsible for national defense and security. The conflict primarily takes place in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian territory, where Hamas is the de facto governing authority.

Today, more than 500 Palestinians in Gaza have been died (martyred) by Israeli Airstrike. It's an act of war crime and international powers should take actions against these.

The conflict between Israel and Hamas has been marked by periods of intense violence, including air strikes carried out by the Israeli military on Hamas targets in Gaza. These air strikes are part of Israel's efforts to respond to attacks and threats posed by Hamas militants. The conflict has resulted in casualties and destruction in both Israel and Gaza, leading to widespread international concern.

The roots of the Israel-Hamas conflict are complex and multifaceted, involving historical, political, and territorial disputes between Israelis and Palestinians. The conflict has led to several wars and numerous rounds of violence, with both sides experiencing significant losses and suffering.

Efforts to resolve the conflict and establish lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians have been ongoing for years, involving international diplomacy and peace initiatives. However, a comprehensive and lasting resolution to the Israel-Hamas conflict remains a challenging and unresolved issue in the Middle East.

Palestinian child in shock after surviving Israeli attack in Gaza | AJ #shorts


Doctors tried to comfort this Palestinian boy who was showing signs of shock after an Israeli attack in Rafah in southern Gaza.

These Palestinian brothers express their heartfelt thanks to the paramedics who rescued them following an Israeli air attack in Gaza.

Will Egypt or any other Arab country support Gaza people against Israel's march?

youtube,"Civil War Has Begun in Gaza! Palestinian Soldiers Hunting Down Hamas Members One by One!


With our news agency, which has been following Israel and Palestine since the beginning of the war, we have once again compiled important developments for you. The destruction brought by these important developments in the short term stunned the whole world!

Hamas' aggression not only against Israel but also against Palestine has mobilized the former Palestinian army. A group of former Palestinian soldiers with strong popular support began fighting against Hamas. This has created a dichotomy in the Gaza Strip and the Palestinian territories, proving once again that HAMAS will soon lose more power. HAMAS is stuck between two fronts! 

DCM Global set out to investigate how things would change in this region, especially from a global perspective, and how lasting the effects would be. But we saw that with the possibility of another organization, Hezbollah, entering the war, things are going to get even more complicated...
As Israel mobilizes with all the equipment at its disposal to finish off Hamas, Hamas' treacherous attacks have once again signaled that the war will escalate....

By following us, you can stay informed and be part of our research on the progress of this war. You can follow the progress of this process in a DIRECT, CLEAN, way while leaving a MARK on this process. And you can witness each of the GLOBAL variables with us!",,2453649,"{'comment_count': '4893', 'like_count': '22156', 'view_count': '2448756'}",DCM Global,,2023-10-18 13:14:08,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4AIibXdqQM,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4AIibXdqQM/default.jpg
